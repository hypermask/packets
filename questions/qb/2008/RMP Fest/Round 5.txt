A 2000 article by Joergensen and Sjoeberg applies this phenomenon to software process improvement, while a 1984 article by Gabrielcik and Fazio subjects this phenomenon to a “strict test”. In 1989, Daniel Cervone observed that this phenomenon can be caused by things that people are asked to envision, which was consistent with the results of a J.S. Carroll experiment about the 1976 Presidential election. McCombs and Shaw observed this phenomenon while studying Chapel Hill, North Carolina during the 1968 Presidential election and argued that it was driven by the news media. The strategy of “misleading vividness” exploits this phenomenon, which was first described by Tversky and Kahneman in 1973 and can lead to the gambler's fallacy. For ten points, name this phenomenon where people make predictions or attributions based on how easily things come to mind.

answer: {Gyorgy Lukacs} [accept: {Georg Lukacs}, {George Lukacs}]

This thinker argued that glorifying illegal activities reinforces the autonomy of the state and is therefore counter-revolutionary in a chapter titled Legality and Illegality. Ontology of Social Being was the last major work of this thinker, though the last to be translated into English was Tailism and the Dialectic. The question “Kafka or Thomas Mann?” titles an essay in which this person praises the realism of Thomas Mann, and this person criticized modernist literature for failing to show the totality of capitalism. This person described Nietzsche as the “founder of Irrationalism” in a chapter of The Destruction of Reason. This thinker defined orthodoxy as adherence to methods of inquiry, rather than adherence to the results of past inquiries, and argued that capitalist art and literature should be allowed to naturally perish in a struggle against Marxist art and literature rather than be banned outright by Marxist regimes. For arguing that the Communist Party should disband and attempt to regain power by persuasion rather than force, this man was purged by Janos Kadar. For ten points, name this author of History and Class Consciousness, a 20th century Hungarian Marxist.

answer: John {Duns Scotus} [prompt on “Doctor Subtilis”]

This man attacked the theory that human knowledge is based on “exemplars” in his reply to Henry of Ghent. This man argued that not even God could break the first three Ten Commandments, and he defined natural law as that which is both self-evident and actually true. This man's concepts of intuitive cognition and intellectual cognition allow humans to know that particular things actually exist. To explain his views on individuality, he coined a term that literally means “thisness”, haecceity. This man's works include “Questions on Porphyry's Isagoge” and a book of “little logical works” known as the Parva Logicalia. The need for a being that is first in efficient causality, final causality, and pre-eminence forms the basis of his “triple primacy” proof of God. His most notable work was the Opus Oxoniense, also called the Ordinatio, which was a commentary on Peter Lombard's Sentences, and he is known as an early proponent of the Immaculate Conception.

Frankfurt School member Axel Honneth wrote a recent book on this concept subtitled “A New Look at an Old Idea”, in which he rejected the idea that it is caused by structural characteristics of social systems. In his critique of Mismeasure of Man, Harvard Medical School professor Bernard Davis claimed that Stephen Jay Gould wrongly defined this concept. The Kyoto School philosopher Keiji Nishitani paired this concept with nullification as part of a dilemma that must be overcome before Absolute Nothingness can be reached. Gershom Scholem uses this term to describe the emergence of Kabbalistic mythology from the Midrash. This concept can lead to the pathetic fallacy, and in Marxism this phenomenon leads to fetishism and and alienation when social relations and labor become treated as commodities. For ten points, name this term that refers to representing an abstraction as if it were a concrete object.
