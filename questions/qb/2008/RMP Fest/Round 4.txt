Paula Carrajana of the University of the Azores recently published a paper about the impact of stories about this man on medieval Portugal, particularly the translation of Secretum Secretorum. Recensio Lambda is a manuscript containing a story about this man written by Pseudo-Methodius, while Archpresbyter Leo of Naples translated a Greek saga about this man into Latin.

Motifs in medieval legends about this man include that his father was Nectanabus, the exiled magician-king of Lybia and that his horse cost thirteen talents and ate human flesh. Liszbarski and Dyroff argued that a Persian epic about this man, which calls him “the horned one”, influenced the language of the Quran.

This man's real-life deeds include performing a mass marriage at Susa, winning the Battle of Sogdian Rock, and defeating Darius III.
