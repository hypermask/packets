answer: {Anabaptists} BA

This movement, whose historians include Carl Cornelius and Albert Henry Newman, is sometimes traced to the author of On Spiritual Warfare, Petr Chelcicky, a Czech theologian who compared the Pope to a whale who had torn the net of true faith and condemned the violence of the Hussites. Sects of this religious movement include the Children of Emlichheim and the Folk of Johan Willemsz, both of whom consisted of followers of Jan van Batenburg. The Bocholt Conference was an attempt to unify this movement, but they could not agree on the issue of polygamy. Andreas Karlstadt allowed three members of this group named Thomas Dreschel, Mark Stubner, and Nicholas Storch to come to Wittenberg, where they were known as the Zwickau Prophets before being expelled by Luther. Under the leadership of Bernhard Kipperdolling, Jan Matthys, and John of Leiden members of this movement established a short-lived theocracy at Munster, where they led a titular rebellion. One figure in this movement wrote the Prague Manifesto, which also influenced the Peasant's War. For ten points, name this group led by Thomas Muntzer, a Protestant movement opposed to child baptism.

A John Perry essay considers this man “on Demonstratives,” while Tyler Burge has written about him “and the Third Realm” and “Sinning Against” this man, a pun on the original title of his most famous essay.  That essay begins by questioning whether an identity is the a priori a-equals-a or the simplest possible case of a-equals-b. He added quantification to formal logic in his first work Concept Script, though his best-known work argues a number is neither a collection of things nor a property, part of his argument attempting to reduce the titular field to logic. Refuted by Russell, that work is his The Foundations of Arithmetic.  FTP, identify this German logician also known for his essay “On Sense and Reference.”

FTP, identify this American philosopher and psychologist, author of Pragmatism.

answer: The {Road} to {Serfdom}

This book cites Werner Sombart, the author of Merchants and Heroes, as an example of a thinker who turned poor Germans towards fascism rather than socialism. Another chapter of this book notes that Germans lack “kindliness and good humor” and are deficient in Zivilcourage, or the ability to stand up for the weak and infirm. The last chapter of this book argues that so long as the world contains small states with nationalist sentiment, enforcing international regulations requires the use of force. This book describes an attempt to abolish the “neutrality of chess” in a chapter titled “The End of Truth”; that chapter also criticizes physicists and surgeons who apply Marxist orthodoxy to their trade. In chapters such as “Why the Worst Get on Top”, this book makes its primary argument: that human limitations necessitate that any form of economic planning would eventually lead to tyranny.
