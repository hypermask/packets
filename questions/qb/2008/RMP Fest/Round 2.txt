Among the Lithuanians, the demon Aitvaras is said to appear as this type of creature when he is indoors. Some early Athenian vase paintings contain images of a curious creature with the forequarters of a horse and the hindquarters of this type of creature. Ares transformed a youth into one of these creatures after that youth failed to prevented Helios from walking in on Ares sleeping with Aphrodite.

He more famously argued that considering the contradictions of church fathers led truth, something he accomplished by addressing 158 questions with the titular responses.  Works like Sic et Non got him condemned by the Council of Soissons and hated by Bernard of Clairvaux. FTP, identify this scholastic, father of Astrolabe, who told the History of My Calamities, which included getting his junk chopped off for banging that piece of ass Heloise.

Later authors claim that this man received ill-will from his father after he and his younger brother used a forbidden silver table and golden cup, as well as sending his father the leg of a sacrificed animal rather than the shoulder. This figure's wife was a daughter of Amphithea, a princess of Argos named Argea, and this man's son Thersander was killed by Telephus while king of Thebes. After this man was expelled from his home city, he enlisted the help of such figures as Capaneus, Parthenopeus, and Adrastus, and he ultimately died at his brother's hands when they simultaneously threw spears at each other. The regent Creon prevented this man's corpse from being touched, though it was eventually sprinkled with dust. FTP, name this son of Oedipus and Jocasta and brother of Eteocles, whose burial by his sister led to conflict in Sophocles' Antigone.

answer: {principle} of {sufficient} reason

Penelope Fitzgerald offers a “psychological” theory of this, while Alexander Pruss offers a “reassessment” of this concept.  In one work about this subject, its author digresses to call Hegel a charlatan and claim that Hegelian “savants” have led German philosophy to be laughed at as if it were a prostitute. That work also discusses “the divine Plato,” argues against Kant's theory of causality and discusses intuitive, perceptive, and complete empirical representations.  The other major writer about this concept used it to account for “truths of fact” as opposed to “truths of reason,” a construction adopted by Christian Wolff but rejected by Kant and the author of the work described earlier, Schopenhauer. Advocated in Section 33 of Monadology, FTP, identify this concept championed by Leibniz, mocked by Voltaire and whose “Fourfold Root” was investigated by Schopenhauer, a claim that “nothing is without a reason for its being.”

Along with Modality and Time, this concept forms the title of a 1980 article by Rosenkratz and Hoffman that offers three definitions of this concept. Flint. Freddoso, and Wierenga popularized the “shared histories approach” for analyzing this concept, and Peter Geach identified meanings of this concept. Rabbis Yitzchok Kirzner and Harold Kushner engaged in a debate on this concept in the 1980's, sparked by Kushner's argument about the limits of this concept. Charles Hartshorne argued against this concept by modifying an argument from Plato's The Sophist which equates being with having power and adding the premise that every being has an active tendency, which, if one accepts that each being can resist every other being's power, makes this concept impossible. A paradox named for this concept was introduced by St. Augustine and involves an infamously heavy rock. For ten points, name this attribute that is generally associated with God, the ability to do anything.
