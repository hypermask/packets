answer: {Imre Lakatos} [accept: {Imre Lipschitz}; {Avrum Lipschitz}; {Imre Molnar}]

A 2003 Kenneth Waltz essay is subtitled “Reflections on” this man. This man's early work included translating the writings of George Polya. Along with his colleague Spiro Latsis, this man criticized Milton Friedman, whom he accused of pseudo-science. This man coined the term “problem shifts”, which he labeled as “degenerate” if they did not lead to the prediction of new facts. This man used the terms “protective belt” and “hard core” to describe a concept that he argued could be reached through both positive and negative heuristics: the research program. This man's premature death foiled his plans to publish a dialogue with Paul Feyerabend, whose part of that dialog was published in 1975 as Against Method, and along with Alan Musgrave this man edited Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge. For ten points, name this man who proposed a dialectic of proofs and refutations to describe mathematical progress, a 20th century Hungarian philosopher of science.

answer: {Tower} of {Silence} [accept: {dakhma}, {dokhma}, {dakhmag}, {deme}, {dema}]

These structures may be surrounded by smaller buildings known as buglis. The main use of these structures is preceded by a ceremony known as the geh sarnu, which includes a kind of ceremonial touching called paiwand. That is followed by an activity called Khurshed nigerishin, for which these structures are primarily designed. These structures are only entered by the nasellar, a special class of caretakers. Coal and sand is used to create filters for the run-off from these structures. The scriptural basis for these structures can be found in Fargard 5 of the Vendidad, which addresses purity. They typically have wells at their center, where bones are placed once they have been bleached by the sun. For ten points, name this structure on which Zoroastrians expose their dead to vultures.

answer: {Loving} v. {Virginia} [accept either order]

This was the first case cited for support in a 2008 Michigan Law Review Article where Erwin Chemerinsky argued that the Supreme Court should have recognized a right-to-die. This decision overturned the state supreme court case Naim v. Naim, and limited a state power recognized in the 1888 case Maynard v. Hill. Potter Stewart filed a short concurring opinion saying that this case had already been decided by the earlier McLaughlin v. Florida. This decision confirmed that Pace v. Alabama was no longer good law, and Earl Warren's majority opinion cited Korematsu v. United States to say that strict scrutiny was appropriate for racial classifications and suggests that there is no valid legislative purpose which makes the color of a person's skin the test of whether his conduct is criminal. The law struck down in this case made an exception for descendants of Pocahontas. For ten points, name this 1967 Supreme Court decision that struck down laws against interracial marriage.

Keith Hoskin and Barry Smart both cite this work's discussion of schools and classroom management, found in the section “Docile Bodies.” Better known is the contrast of a symbolic approach to the title actions with the carceral approach, with the Medieval method exemplified by the opening discussion of an attempted regicide in “Body of the Condemned” and “Spectacle of the Scaffold.” Most famous for its discussion of Mettray as an example of a Jeremy Bentham-designed structure, FTP, identify this work that discusses the Panopticon prison design, a work of Michel Foucault.

A 1996 experiment by William F. Brewer showed that this effect can influence a person's opinion about whether or not a story is complete or coherent; that experiment involved a tale about a woman swimming across the Strait of Gibraltar. A 1980 article by Ronald Clyman observed this effect among healthcare providers, while Deborah Fein observed this effect among nine year old children. Rubin and Peplau devised a scale to measure how pronounced this effect is in an individual. Deborah Fein observed this effect among nine year old children. A 1971 experiment on this effect involved the draft lottery and showed that camaraderie did not stop this effect. Another experiment on this effect showed that a woman's perceived attractiveness decreases when she is shown being electrocuted. First documented by Melvin Lerner, one experiment about this effect showed that when a woman's actions lead to a marriage proposal, she is described as a good person, but when those same actions are seen leading to a rape, she is described as a bad person. For ten points, name this cognitive bias where people make unfair attributions out of a desire to believe that that life is fair.

The end of the introduction to this work refers to feeling the “tension of the bow” and “the arrow and the task.” This work's famous concluding section was originally a letter to Heinrich von Stein and bears similarities to “To the Mistral: a Dancing Song,” also by this work's author. Another section of the work answers the titular question with a Lamarckian evolutionary account of the aristocratic class, while yet another section contrasts “philosophical laborers” with actual philosophers. The latter two sections are the aphoristic “We Scholars,” and “What is Noble” while the first is “From the High Mountains” which is titled as an “aftersong.”  Beginning with the question “Supposing truth is a woman - what then?”, FTP, identify this precursor to Genealogy of Morals, a work of Friedrich Nietzsche's about living in the titular state.

answer: The {Apology}

In this, a child is compared to a foal or calf, but since he is a human, Evenus the Parian rather than a horse-trainer will be used to instruct that son of Callius.  Claims made late in this include that the speaker wants his audience to discipline his children and, fortunately for the speaker, nothing bad can happen to a good man. The speaker complains that the body he is addressing is like a lazy horse, while he is a gadfly that prods them to action with maxims like “the unexamined life is not worth living.”  Addressed to Anytus and Meletus, for ten points, identify this dialog where Socrates defends himself from charges of corrupting the youth of Athens.

answer: {Scylla} WD, SK

This name is attached to a number of figures from Greek myth of whom the least well known was probably the only surviving daughter of Zeus and Lamia before the latter went insane over the death of her other children and became a demonic spirit that kills babies. Another was turned into an egret when she drowned swimming alongside the ship of a man she loved and whose affections she had purchased by cutting a purple lock of her father's hair, leading to that father's death. Ovid connects that one with the most famous one, a daughter of Phorcys for whom Glaucus rejected either Amphitrite or Circe, leading to her being cursed to have a human upper body but with barking dogs' heads coming from her vagina.

answer: {Thomism} BA

The “neo” variety of this school of thought is associated Josef Kleutgen, Tommaso Zigliara, and Gaetano Sanseverino, and this school was the subject of the papal encyclical Aeterni Patris. G.K. Chesterton described this school of thought as “the philosophy of common sense”, claiming that, unlike pragmatism, Hegelianism, or idealism, it views an egg as an egg. William of Ockham rejected this school of thought and criticized its concepts of active and passive intellect. In the Scholastic Era, it was associated with Dominicans from the Iberian Peninsula, but in the 19th century it was promoted by Pope Leo XIII, who declared it the basis of Catholic thought, a view expounded by all subsequent Popes. Followers of this school adhere to the thought of an Italian monk known as Doctor Universalis whose works included “Summa contra Gentiles”. For ten points, name this school of Christian philosophy, which is singly eponymous after the first name of a certain Aquinas.
