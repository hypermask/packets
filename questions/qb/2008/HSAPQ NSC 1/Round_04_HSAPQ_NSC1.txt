The area of one of these figures can be found with Bretschneider's formula, which reduces to Brahmaguptra's formula for special cases. In general, their area is “one half the length of the cross product of the diagonals,” and Van Aubel's Theorem shows that the lines connecting the centers of squares constructed on one's sides are perpendicular and equal.

answer: {Hess's} law

The Bordwell cycle extends this principle to a related quantity. The quantity that this rule concerns is the sum of internal energy and the product of pressure and volume, though that quantity, governed by this law, is better known for a change in value that is equal to TdS plus Vdp. This law may be used to calculate a compound's lattice energy via the Born-Haber cycle. For 10 points, identify this prediction, which relies on the fact that a certain thermodynamic quantity is a state function, and suggests that the change in enthalpy is independent of the path from reactants to products.

Two alternatives to the most common explanation for this quantity invoke the Abbott-Farhi model or technicolor, though better accepted is a tachyon condensation model called the Higgs mechanism. Special relativity calculates it by dividing the Lorentz factor into the rest version of this, and the resistance to acceleration under the influence of a given force may be quantified by its inertial type. For 10 points, identify this physical quantity that indicates how much matter an object contains, which in a famous equation may be converted to energy.

answer: {adrenaline} [or {epinephrine}; prompt on "{epi}"]

One function of this hormone is to bind to alpha-one receptors in the liver to activate the inositol- phospholipid signaling pathway. Another of its functions sees it bind to beta receptors to activate the adenylate cyclase signaling pathway, which spurs glycogenolysis in the liver.
