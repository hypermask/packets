answer: {drag} [prompt on “{resistance}”]

Langevin's equation states the real force on a particle as the sum of the forces involved in Brownian motion and the hydrodynamic version of this quantity. The Fresnel coefficient is sometimes known as the coefficient of [this], and it is often a result of friction between a solid surface and the gas it passes through. This force is responsible for an object reaching terminal velocity in free fall, and in aero- dynamics it opposes thrust. For 10 points, name this force that retards an object's path through the air.

answer: {harmonic} oscillator

The ladder operator method is used to analyze the solutions to this system's quantum analogue. Ones with a time-dependent external force are driven, while ones with a source of external friction are called damped. These systems famously display both linearity and time translation invariance, and their solutions frequently invoke an angular frequency proportional to one over the square root of mass. Springs are common examples of, for 10 points, what system, whose periodic motion centers on an equilibrium position?

answer: {torque}

Gyroscopic precession is also called this induced precession, and Poinsot's ellipsoid models another kind of precession called this-free. Deformation due to this creates a shearing stress and is called torsion. Equal to the product of the moment of inertia and the angular acceleration, it is also the time derivative of the angular momentum. For 10 points, identify this pseudo-vector quantity proportional to the cross product of the force applied and the lever arm, a rotational analogue of force.

answer: free energy [or Gibbs free energy; or Helmholtz free energy]

The Flory-Huggins model can be used to derive this quantity. Differentiating this quantity with respect to volume yields pressure, while differentiating with respect to number of particles yields chemical potential, and differentiating with respect to temperature yields entropy. The two main types of this are defined as either the internal energy or enthalpy minus the product of temperature and entropy. For 10 points, name this thermodynamic quantity that denotes the amount of work available in a system and comes in Helmholtz and Gibbs varieties.
