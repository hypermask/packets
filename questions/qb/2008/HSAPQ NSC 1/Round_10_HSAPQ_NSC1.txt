answer: {potassium} ion channels [or {K+ion} channels]

The shaker mutation, which results in shaking under anesthesia, causes a defect in these proteins. The S5 and S6 trans-membrane helices of this protein are homologous in both voltage-gated and non- voltage-gated types of this protein.

For 10 points, name these ion channels, which allow the efflux of a positive ion that is neither calcium nor sodium.
