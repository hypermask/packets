Resistance to it is present in many cases of polycystic ovary syndrome as well as in “Syndrome X”. The radioimmunoassay for it was developed by Rosalyn Yalow, years after Frederick Sanger determined its primary structure. It is often taken subcutaneously using namesake “pens”, and usually degrades 71 minutes after its release from beta cells. Activation of it results in glycogen absorption, and it thus opposes the effects of glucagon. For 10 points, name this hormone which is secreted in the pancreas and is disturbed by diabetes.
