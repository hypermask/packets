answer: {mitochondria} [or {mitochondrion}]

Cardiolipin in the membranes that bind these organelles can cause Barth syndrome, while a protein that manages a positive feedback loop with IP3, cytochrome c, is located in their inner membranes. Kearnes-Sayre syndrome arises due to five thousand base pair deletions in their maternally inherited DNA, the presence of which suggests the endosymbiontic theory. Filled by cristae and the matrix, for 10 points, identify these organelles, home to the electron transport chain.

answer: electronegativity

Sanderson defined it as the ratio of atomic number to atomic volume, divided by the expected ratio as extrapolated from noble gas data. Another measure of it is based on the square root of differences in ionic resonance energy between two elements, while Mulliken defines it as the average of first ionization energy and electron affinity. For 10 points, name this tendency of an atom to attract electrons of other atoms to itself, for which fluorine has a value of 4.0 according to the Pauling scale.

answer: {charge} [accept {charge carriers} or {particles possessing charge} or equivalents]

The Lorentz equation describes the force exerted on a mobile one. The density of this at surfaces is represented by sigma and is equal to the Laplacian of the electric field. It is denoted by the letter Z, and Gauss's law states the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to this quantity enclosed by that surface. Robert Millikan's oil drop experiment measured, for 10 points, what quantity whose time derivative is current, and whose value for electrons is negative one.
