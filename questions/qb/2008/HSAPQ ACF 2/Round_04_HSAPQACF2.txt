answer: {fluorine} [accept {F} before end of question; accept hydrogen fluoride before “ion,” accept

Calcium gluconate gel is used to treat exposure to a compound containing an ion derived from this element. Henri Moissan developed the electrolytic process still used today to isolate its diatomic form, and it cannot form oxyacids because it lacks a d orbital. The first noble gas compound used several molecules of this element, and it is the most electronegative element. For 10 points, name this element, the last with a partially filled 2p subshell, which has atomic number 9 and atomic symbol F.

A recent study by James Elsner and Thomas Jagger of Florida State University linked hurricane intensity to the number of these objects. Variations in these objects are predicted by Sporer's law. Their numbers fell drastically between 1645 and 1715, which is known as the Maunder Minimum; however, their numbers generally wax and wane over an 11-year period. For 10 points, name these cool dark objects that are found on the surface of their namesake object, which is located at the center of our Solar System.

MOSFET transistors can be destroyed due to a phenomenon tangentially related to this, known as the triboelectric effect. One effect which has reduced it to almost zero has been observed in graphite, and thermoplastics frequently utilize its namesake welding. Stokes' law describes the force exerted by its fluid analog, and its most common model was actually first described by Coulomb. Minimized by HDTE, nylon, and ball bearings and frequently occurring in static and kinetic varieties, for 10 points, name this force resisting motion involving two surfaces.
