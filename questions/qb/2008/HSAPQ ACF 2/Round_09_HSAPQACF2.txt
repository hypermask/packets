Though they are not hydrogen bonds, the presence of these cause alkyl halides to have higher boiling points than regular alkanes, and a vector quantity associated with these is proportional to their separation distance. Homonouclear diatomics cannot be used in infrared spectroscopy since they do not have a permanent one of these, and ones induced instantaneously account for a weak form of intermolecular forces named for London. For 10 points, identify these pairs of oppositely charged particles, which exist permanently in polar molecules such as water.

answer: Heisenberg Uncertainty principle

One statement of it is applicable to the measurement of a quantum state of a particle, and has an energy-time formulation. The Bohr model violates this statement since it assigns a definite radius to the electron. The Cauchy-Schwartz inequality is used to derive this statement, which relates the standard deviation of two conjugate variables to Planck's constant over 4 pi. For 10 points, identify this statement which implies that one cannot simultaneously know both the position and velocity of a particle, named for a German physicist.
