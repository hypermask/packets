answer: {Snell's} law of refraction

The namesake of this law wrote the book Eratosthenes Batavus, which described a new method of finding the radius of the Earth. This law was independently discovered by Rene Descartes, and can be proven by Fermat's principle of least time.

For 10 points, name this law of optics named for a Dutchman.
