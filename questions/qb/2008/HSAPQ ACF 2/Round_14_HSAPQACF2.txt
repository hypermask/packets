answer: {turbulent} flow [or {turbulence}]

The proportionality between the rate of transport of a component in this type of system and that component's gradient rate of transport is given by the austausch coefficient. During this process, the velocity difference is proportional to the distance to the one-third power, according to Kolmogorov. The statistical explanations for it arise because the solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are unstable past a certain point, generally above a Reynolds number of four thousand. For 10 points, name this chaotic flow, contrasted with laminar flow.

answer: {enthalpy} [prompt on {H}; prompt on {heat content}]

This quantity is invariant for a gas travelling across a shock wave. For an isobaric process, the change in this quantity is directly proportional to the specific heat, and it can also be defined as internal energy plus pressure times volume. The quantity of this type associated with lattices is the amount of energy required to convert solid atoms into gaseous ions. For a given reaction it must be constant, regardless of the pathway, according to Hess's law. Gibbs free energy is a function of temperature, entropy, and this quantity. For 10 points, identify this state function.
