answer: {viscosity} [accept {kinetic viscosity} before “{poise}”]

The Prandtl number is the ratio of this quantity to thermal diffusivity. Euler's equation is used if this quantity is assumed to be negligible, and it can be measured in either stokes or poise. The Reynolds number is equal to the ratio of inertial forces to forces attributable to it. The kinetic type is equal to the dynamic type divided by the density, and this quantity is constant in Newtonian fluids. For 10 points, give this term for a fluid's resistance to flow.

answer: attention

Patients with Balint Syndrome give insight into the neurological origins of this process. Donald Broadbent introduced the first information theory-based theory of it, and for a time dichotic speech was one stimulus used to quantify it. A “blindness” caused by lack of it was shown in a 1999 study, in which participants failed to see a person in a gorilla suit because they had been instructed to count the number of passes made during a video.

answer: {Chandrasekhar} Limit

One analog of this concept is named after Tolman, Oppenheimer, and Volkov. Its namesake solved three cases of the Lane-Emden equation. The denominator of the formula used to calculate it includes the square of the number of nucleons per electron, and Schonberg's name is sometimes appended to it. Equal to approximately 1.4 solar masses, for 10 points, name this theoretical maximum mass a white dwarf can obtain before collapsing in on itself and forming a black hole, a limit named after an Indian physicist.

answer: {conjugate} [accept word forms; prompt on “{electron delocalization}” until mentioned]

This term refers to a property whose extension causes the UV absorption wavelength of an organic compound to decrease by 30 nanometers according to the Woodward Feiser rules. Only dienes which exhibit this property can participate in the Diels Alder reaction, and it is associated with delocalization of electrons. This word also describes the species in the numerator of the logarithm function in the Henderson Hasselbalch equation. For 10 points, identify this word which describes the type of base that results from the deprotonation of an acid.

answer: {stomata} [or guard cells]

Their function is inhibited by the ABA hormone, and Zeaxanthin is involved in the activation of these structures. Transport of protons from the cytoplasm causes their activation with the uptake of potassium ions. They are inactive during the day in organisms that use malic acid in their metabolism, and they involve the opening and closing of two guard cells to allow for the diffusion of gases, called transpiration. For 10 points, identify these structures, which are involved in the exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor in plants.

answer: {entropy}

A limit to the best lossless compression is titled after this concept and is named for Shannon, who published it in “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.” Schrödinger expounded the idea that its “negative” form feeds life in What is Life? and a metaphor for its mechanism is the “arrow of time.” Boltzmann's constant is multiplied with the logarithm of multiplicity to obtain it, and Clausius defined a precursor to it, disgregation. Described as constant or increasing by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, for 10 points, name this measure of disorder in a system.
