In an Evans-Pritchard work that is set "Among the Nuer," this principle is contrasted with political associations. This word is the last in the title of a 1949 book that developed the alliance theory, and was written by Lévi-Strauss. Its terminology was developed by Lewis Henry Morgan, who included Iroquois and Crow as examples of bifurcate merging. Godparents are often an example of the fictive type, and it can be shown with a genealogy diagram. For 10 points, name this relation between persons that is often based on marriage or common ancestry.

answer: {hydrogen} bonds [prompt on {H}; prompt on {dipole}-{dipole bonds/forces}]

The “symmetric” types of these interactions seem to violate the duet rule, and occur in high-pressure ice known as “Ice X.” This is the main mechanism by which R-groups in DNA interact, and the spacing of them results in the alpha helix and beta pleated sheet. Water's high boiling point is due to the high ratio of these bonds to the low molecular mass. For 10 points, name this type of bond resulting from the dipole-dipole force between an electronegative atom and the namesake element bonded to nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine.

answer: La {Bohème}

Adopted from an Henri Murger novel by Giacosa and Illica, this opera sees one character discuss his motivations in the aria "Donde lieta usci" and confess his love in "Che gelida manina." At the end, Schaunard pronounces the death of one character, shortly after Colline sets out to pawn an overcoat.

In one section of this work, Roussillon cooks the heart of Cabestanh and feeds it to his wife. In another section, the monk Rustico sleeps with Alibech on the pretext of “putting the Devil in Hell.” Its first section begins with a story about the evil machinations of Ser Ciappelletto, and is told by Panfilo. Its narrators include Emilia, Pampinea, and Fiammetta, who wait out the Black Death in Fiesole. For 10 points, name this fourteenth-century work narrated by seven women and three men, a collection of one hundred stories by Giovanni Boccaccio.

answer: {magnetic} field

The rotation of plane-polarized light traveling along the direction of one of these can be calculated using the Verdet constant. This quantity is equal to the curl of the vector potential, and a potential difference is created across a metal plate when it is applied perpendicular to the current; that phenomenon is known as the Hall effect. For a solenoid it is equal to the permeability constant times the number of turns times the current, which can be derived from Ampere's law. For 10 points, identify this counterpart of the electric field.

answer: “{Dover} Beach”

The author of this work asserts that the world lies before us “like a land of dreams,” but quashes such thoughts by claiming that it lacks joy, love, light, certitude, peace, and help for pain. The “turbid ebb and flow / Of human misery” posited in this poem stems from an “eternal note of sadness” heard under the “naked shingles of the world” and also by “Sophocles long ago.” For 10 points, name this poem that imagines a “darkling plain... / Where ignorant armies clash by night,” a work of Matthew Arnold.

answer: {auxins}

It was recently discovered that the F-box protein from the complex SCFTIR1 is a receptor for them. PIN proteins regulate their efflux, and they cause miscarriages and leukemia, as evinced by 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, two of them in Agent Orange. Also responsible for parthenocarpy, they activate expansins in one of their main functions. In low concentrations, they can delay flower senescence. Featuring prominently in the acid growth hypothesis, and competing with cytokinins in apical dominance, for 10 points, name this class of plant growth hormones.

This entity requires proper functioning of the protein frataxin, which, when mutated, causes Friedrich's ataxia. Another disease of these bodies limits eye movement and is known as Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Lynn Margulis popularized the idea that these bodies are proteobacteria that underwent endosymbiosis. This organelle's inner folds are called cristae, and it contains its own DNA that is inherited exclusively from an organism's mother. For 10 points, name this powerhouse of eukaryotic cells.

He painted a white angel on a hill behind a man in pink robes in St. John on Patmos. In another of his works, a nun has a Bible on her head and observes a man with a funnel on his head extracting a stone of madness, in The Cure of Folly. He painted a triptych where peasants carry pitchforks while a man playing a lute rides the title Haywain that chases creatures like a fish with legs. He painted the creation of the world on the outside of a work that shows monstrous birds eating humans. For 10 points, name this Dutch painter of The Garden of Earthly Delights.

One condition with this name caused the destruction of the Flight 501 of the Ariane 5 launch system. In the x86 processor, the TEST instruction clears its namesake flag, and the DieHard allocator prevents the “heap” form of this from happening. “Trampolining” is a notable method of exploiting the stack buffer form of this phenomenon, and the arithmetic form of it excludes division by zero. Infinite recursion is a common cause of the stack form of this condition. For 10 points, name this term referring to crashes caused by an inundation of information or data.
