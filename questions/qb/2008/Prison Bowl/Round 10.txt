answer: glass 

During the Hellenistic period, the millefiori technique was developed, allowing people to create intricate designs in it. A light green type of this, called trinitite, was formed as a result of the Trinity nuclear test. It is formed by quenching a melt. In medieval Europe, the bullseye of the crown type of this was less expensive than the outer edges. Because of the lack of electric transition states in the range of visible light and because of its homogeneity, it is usually transparent. (*) Some common types include the Germania, soda-lime, and borosilicate types. Natural ones, such as obsidian, are usually produced in lava flows. It is cooled through its transition temperature quickly enough so that a crystal lattice cannot form, hence they are amorphous. For 10 points, name this solid material commonly used in window panes.

answer: Light-Emitting {Diode} (prompt on {diode})

Typically, one side is flat and has a shorter lead to mark the cathode side, as they must be inserted in the right direction. The flat side corresponds to a straight line segment on one side of their circuit diagram symbol. In AC applications where the current exceeds the breakdown voltage, they can be protected by placing a second one in inverse parallel. Although they are much more reliable than incandescent sources, (*) they can still be damaged by a sudden change in temperature, which might cause cracks to form in the epoxy resin in the packaging. Aluminum gallium arsenide is used in red and infrared ones, while blue ones require a quantum well and are thus more expensive to produce and rarer. The color of the plastic casing does not significantly affect the color. FTP, name this electronic device which exhibits electroluminescence and allows current to flow in only one direction.

These cause the only known diseases that can be sporadic, genetic, or infectious. They behave somewhat like ice-nine in Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle.

They can cause Kuru, (*) as well as scrapie in sheep and goats, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. They aggregate to form plaques called amyloids, which disrupt tissue structure and make brain tissue appear spongelike. FTP, name these infectious agents responsible for mad cow disease.

In its payoff matrix as described by Douglas Hofstadter, the sucker's payoff must have the lowest value and the temptation to defect payoff must have the highest value.
