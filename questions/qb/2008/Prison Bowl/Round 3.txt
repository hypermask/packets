This figure is formed by graphing y=(1/x) with a domain restriction to avoid the asymptote, then rotating it in 3 dimensions around the x axis. Integrating under the curve shows that the volume approaches pi, while the surface area is greater than two pi times the natural log of the upper bound of integration.
