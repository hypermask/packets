answer: {Pythagorean} theorem

However, there cannot be any (*) trigonometric proof for it because the trigonometric identities are themselves proven using it. By its converse, which is also true, tying 12 equally-spaced knots in a loop of rope may have allowed ancient Egyptians to construct right angles. A more general form of it is the law of cosines, which holds true for all triangles. FTP, name this theorem of Euclidean geometry which states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of its legs.

That specific kind is diametric and is structured in 6 bundles. They can activate primase, and they come in rho and DNAb families, along with superfamilies based on motifs found in their structures. (*) 5'-3' kinds require a covalent bond to single strands, and all of them move along a phosphodiester backbone of a nucleic acid.

answer: {xenon} (accept {Xe} early)

This element is used in lamps that produce short, intense flashes of light like stroboscopes and high-speed photography. The existence of its 129 isotope in many meteorites suggest that it is a product of the decay of iodine-129. Another isotope of this element, with atomic mass 135, is produced by uranium fission, while its most common isotope has an atomic mass of 132. In 1962, Neil Bartlett formed a red, crystalline solid out of this element's hexafluoroplatinate, and other compounds this elements form include one with Cs2F8 and a series of fluorides, of which the easiest to prepare is (*) tetrafluoride. These compounds all go against the conventional wisdom that compounds can not be made from noble gases. First isolated by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers in 1898 by fractional distillation of krypton, FTP, name this noble gas with atomic number 54 and chemical symbol Xe.

In one lecture he discussed the Greek origin of the word "hymn" in relation to Holderlin's poem "Der Ister," while he argued that each new work of art inherently changes the meaning of existence in his essay "Origin of the Work of Art" that appears in his collection Off the Beaten Track. In his most famous work he asserted the need for escaping from the "hermeneutic circle" and discussed the concept of Aletheia and Dasein, which was heavily influenced by his teacher Edmund (*) Husserl.
