answer: ethers 

The name for this type of organic compound was first used in 1730 by F.G. Frobenius, and non-IUPAC names for some include anisole and phenetole. Used as solvents for Grignard reagents, and as inert media for reactions like the Grignard and Wurtz-Fittig reactions, along with esters, these can be tested for by splitting them with hydroiodic acid, known as the Zeisel method. These are soluble in organic liquids, but most are not soluble in water, an exception to which is dioxane, a (*) cyclic one of these. They are generally synthesized by reacting alkyl halides with sodium alcoholates, a process known as Williamson synthesis. Featuring two R groups connected to an oxygen, FTP, name this group of organic compounds whose diethyl type is often used as an anasthetic.

answer: {Bernoulli's} principle or {equations} (accept {Venturi effect} before mentioned)

Used in carburetors to draw in fuel and mix it with the air, the Venturi effect is a case of this. In the Venturi effect, fluid flowing through a pipe with a constriction in it must satisfy the equation of continuity and the conservation of energy, thus producing a choked flow, used to control the delivery of water through spigots and valves. The fallacy of the equal-transit-time theory makes the popular explanation that lift on an airfoil is generated by this (*) effect false. However, it can be used to calculate the air pressure and velocity over an aircraft wing, which may be the cause of the misconception. FTP, name this principle in fluid dynamics stating that a decrease in fluid velocity results in an increase in fluid pressure.

A category 5 on the PSI scale, it was first observed at Fort Riley, Kansas and in Queens, New York. Soon afterwards, it appeared in Boston, Massachusetts, Sierra Leone, and Brest. 99% of its resulting deaths occurred in people under 65, and it killed up to 20% of those infected. As the disease spread, many countries were reluctant to publicize it due to censorship, except for one country whose newspapers freely discussed it because it had not imposed censorship, as it was not involved in the (*) war. A major factor accelerating its spread was the increased amount of travel. Sailors and soldiers spread the disease to different countries, and the close quarters and stress of combat during World War I increased their susceptibility. FTP, name this outbreak of the H1N1 virus which started in 1918.
