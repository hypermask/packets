The alpha type of this cannot be dissolved in a 17.5% solution of sodium hydroxide at 20 degrees Celsius. It is a straight chain polymer derived from beta-glucose, whose hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds with each other, contributing to its high tensile strength. In 1908, a Swedish textiles engineer treated it with alkali and carbon disulfide to create viscose, which was extruded through a slit to create a clear film. Rayon can be made by extruding viscose though a hole rather than a slit. In vascular (*) plants it is synthesized at the cell membrane by rosette terminal complexes. Although it cannot be digested by humans, it acts as a dietary fiber, absorbing water and making defecation easier. Some animals, for example cows and termites, can digest it with the help of certain micro-organisms. FTP, name this structural polysaccharide found in the cell walls of green plants.

answer: Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander {Schrödinger}

His 1944 book What is Life? introduced the term "negentropy" and discussed the idea of an "aperiodic crystal" which contained genetic information, a concept which later inspired Watson and Crick to research the structure of DNA. In his 1926 paper, Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem, he published an equation describing the time- and space-dependence of quantum mechanical systems, using a model of the atom as waves rather than particles. Later, he rejected the mainstream definition of wave-particle duality altogether, promoting the wave concept alone. This led him to propose a (*) thought experiment to demonstrate the absurdity of wavefunction collapse. FTP, name this Austrian-Irish physicist whose namesake thought experiment involves a vial of poison, a decaying atom, and a cat.
