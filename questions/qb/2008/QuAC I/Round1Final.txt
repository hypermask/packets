This figure once became king of a city of men who become birds once a month. In another episode, he escapes cannibals by refusing to eat their madness-inducing root, only to go to another land where he has to invent the stirrup and bridle for horses. On his first trip he ran aground on what he thought was an island but which turns out to be a whale with trees growing on its back, and after one shipwreck he finds the egg of the giant bird called the Roc. Also the slayer of the Old Man of the Sea, for 10 points name this figure from Arabic folklore whose seven voyages figure prominently in the 1,001 Nights.

answer: Frieda {Kahlo}

This artist painted The Suicide of Dorothy Hale while staying in New York and was inspired by votive portraits known as retabolos. Henry Ford Hospital and What the Water Gave Me act as this artist's autobiography, notably expressing angst over her numerous miscarriages. The Broken Column shows her split open to see the result of a bus accident which left her with permanent spine damage, and one of her many self-portraits is in the form of a doppelganger connected by a single blood vessel. For 10 points, identify this unibrowed Mexican painter, the two-time wife of Diego Rivera.

These actions can only take place when a Unanimous Consent Agreement is not in place. One notable example was executed by someone dubbed “Kingfish” and included recipes for “pot-likkers”, while Thomas Hart Benton and John Calhoun used this to prevent Henry Clay from passing a bank bill. The longest individual one, which exceeded 24 hours, was executed by segregationist Strom Thurmond against the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Thwartable by a supermajority of sixty votes for cloture, this is for 10 points what practice of delaying a vote on a bill by not relinquishing the floor in a Senate debate?

answer: {Magna Carta}

It seeked the removal of fish-weirs from major waterways, and the first section deals with a dispute over the independence of Steven Langston. Its clause 12 states that a levy to raise ransom money for the king known as “scutage”, to knight his eldest son or marry off his eldest daughter, cannot be imposed without the “common counsel of the realm.” Its clause 61 states that the Great Council can foreswear allegiance to the monarch in some cases, leading its signatory to renounce it, an act culminating in the Baron's War. Also codifying the already-extant expectations of habeas corpus and signed at Runnymede, this is, for 10 points, what document limiting the tyranny of the English monarch, signed by King John in 1215?

answer: {activation} energy [or {free} energy of {activation}]

This value appears in the numerator in Black's equation, which is used to calculate it for self-diffusion in pure metals. It is usually determined experimentally by taking the slope of the line that appears on the graph plotting the log of k against one over temperature. A negative value of this quantity appears in the exponential divided by RT in the Arrhenius equation. For 10 points, name this value that is lowered by catalysts, and is equal to the minimum energy that molecules must have in order to react.

answer: {Leviticus} (accept {Vayikra})

This book calls for a woman to bring two doves or two pigeons to her priest on the eighth day after the beginning of her menstrual cycle, one of which is burned as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. It also relates the tale of Nadab and Abihu, sons of Aaron, who presented a “strange fire” in the tabernacle and were burned by God and buried outside the camp. In recent years, its most discussed prohibition has been in Chapter 18, Verse 22, which suggests that one should not “lie with mankind as with womankind,” read by evangelicals as a prohibition against homosexuality. With a name meaning “And he called,” for 10 points what is this third book of the Pentateuch?

answer: {mantle}

The deepest parts of this region display dramatically reduced viscosity; some have argued to call this region the Bullen layer, rather than the existing name of D'' (D double-prime). It is constantly in the process of shedding potassium, and is rich in olivines. This region's namesake plumes are thought to be the cause of flood basalts as well as hotspots, while the upper portion of this region, which exhibits isostasy is named the aesthenosphere and has the Moho discontinuity as its outer edge. For 10 points, this is what region of the Earth, which resides between the crust and the outer core?

answer: The {Joker}

His creation is attributed to either Bill Finger or Jerry Robinson, with the distinctive look based partly on the look of actor Conrad Veidt in one film. This man, perhaps originally Red Hood, is credited with killing Sarah Gordon and Jason Todd as well as permanently injuring Oracle, while another story sees his psychiatrist Harleen Quinzl falling in love with him and attempting to feed his arch-nemesis to piranhas. In television and movies, he's been played by Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson. For 10 points name this fictional villain more recently played by Heath Ledger, a nemesis of the Batman.

answer: unemployment

Okun's Law states that a one percent increase in the difference between the actual and natural types of this concept will cause a 2 – 3% drop in GDP. The Keynesian, or cyclical, variety occurs when the economy does not exhibit sufficient aggregate demand for goods and services, while the frictional type describes people currently in this state who lack complete information about the labor market, such as recent graduates. Contrasted with inflation by the Phillips Curve and combined with it in the “misery index”, this is, for 10 points, what condition, exhibited by people on strike and victims of layoffs?

Inspirations for the program of this work, whose most familiar version was produced by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov after the composer's death, included Pushkin's Tzar Saltan and the composer's opera Undine, whose music was recycled for its famous love duet. The central female is kidnapped by the evil sorcerer Rothbart, who tricks the prince into pledging his fidelity to Odile, and her parents' tears form the titular location. In most versions, Odette then dies or is condemned to remain away from Siegfried in the form of the titular bird. For 10 points, name this ballet, the first by Tchaikovsky.

answer: “{Richard Cory}”

The title character of this poem may have been modeled after the author's brother Hennan, though that man was a heavy drinker, unlike the subject of this poem. The pronoun “we” likely refers to the residents of Tillbury Town, who are “on the pavement” and later “[wait] for the light”. Though the speakers must go “without the meat”, they seem impressed that the title character is “human when he talk[s]”. That character is described as a “gentleman from sole to crown” who “glittered when he walked” until the final stanza which turns bleak. For 10 points, name this poem whose title figure “[puts] a bullet through his head,” a work of Edwin Arlington Robinson?

answer: ({cold} or {nuclear}) {fusion} [do NOT accept "{fission}"]

The minimal criterion for it to be productive is given by the product of ion density and confinement time, and is known as Lawson's criterion. In 1989, B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann allegedly performed one type of this process at room temperature; however, attempts to replicate that work have failed. Examples of the exothermic variety of this process include the CNO cycle and the proton-proton chain reaction, the latter of which occurs in the sun. For 10 points, name this thermonuclear reaction in which nuclei of light atoms come together to form nuclei of heavier atoms.

answer: Third Crusade

One of its victories was at Iconium against the Seljuk Turks. After one of its major leaders drowned, his remaining forces were led by Leopold V of Austria and Frederick of Swabia. Its other two major leaders met at Vezelay and traveled eastward by sea, one stopping off to rescue his fiancée Berengeria of Navarre and conquer Cyprus. The other king took Acre and went home, while the other stuck around to take Jaffa in 1192 but then arranged a peace with Saladin, leaving Jerusalem in Muslim control. For 10 points, this describes what crusade involving Frederick Barbarossa, Philip II, and Richard the Lion-Hearted?

Though Pythagoras may have coined the word “kosmos”, this man was the first to use it in any extant text, and he claimed the universe had a fundamental unity he termed “logos.” He expressed the intrinsic similarity in being asleep and awake in his “unity of opposites” theory. Only one of this philosopher's works, “On Nature”, survives, in which he argued that all existence was in flux, being constantly formed from or destroyed by fire, which he posited was the fundamental substance. For 10 points, name this ancient philosopher, known for positing that one cannot step into the same river twice.
