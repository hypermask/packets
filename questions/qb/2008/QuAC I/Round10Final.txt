answer: {Death} of a Salesman

The stage directions for this play call for soft flute music to be played at the entrance of the protagonist, a motif meant to evoke his father, a flute maker. He expresses optimism about his sons' desire to get involved in the sales of sporting goods, a scheme dubbed the “Florida idea.” Through flashbacks we learn that the protagonist mocked his neighbor's son, Bernard, for studying so much and not being “well liked,” though now Bernard is a successful lawyer, and one of only a few who attend the protagonist's funeral after his suicide.

answer: Mount {Etna}

The vegetation occurring here includes a plant called spino santo, and an eruption on this peak led to a law forbidding the artificial diversion of lava flows which was only repealed in 1983. This was apparently because the citizens of Catania on its southern slope and the Ionian Sea tried to divert the lava to the north of the city. That eruption in took place in 1669 above the town of Nicolosi and as a result, Monti Rossi formed. In a myth about it, this oldest recorded active volcano was reputed to be the site of the suicide of Empedocles. For ten points, name this stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily?

answer: g [accept {acceleration} from {gravity} or equivalents; prompt on “{gravity}”]

One way to solve for this quantity is to multiply 8 pi squared times the length of a pendulum divided by 3 times the square of the period of that same pendulum. It is also determined through the use of an Atwood machine, where the difference between the two masses is divided by their sum and multiplied by the acceleration. The period of a simple pendulum is given by the square root of L over this quantity. For 10 points, name this quantity, whose value on Earth is 9.8 meters per second squared.

answer: {chelates} [accept word forms, such as "{chelating} agents"]

Alcaligin is one of these found in bacteria that contains three hydroxamic acid groups, and is known as a siderophore. Its namesake effect can be seen in the reaction between 3 moles of ethylenediamine, 1 mol of a nickel ion, and 6 moles of ammonia, and is related to the macrocyclic effect. Arguably the most famous example of these has a charge of negative four, features six donor atoms, and is often used in treating heavy-metal poisoning. EDTA is an example of, for 10 points, what type of complex ion in which a metal ion is bonded to a ligand?

answer: {electrolysis}

The Fleischmann-Pons experiment supposedly detected cold fusion during a routine run of this procedure. One scientist's laws of this procedure suggest that the product of molar mass and total charge divided by the product of his constant and valence number is equal to the altered mass. Faraday also observed that platinum was ideal for this process, since iron, for example, will often react with the product generated at the anode. For 10 points, identify this process used to break down compounds, most often used to extract hydrogen and oxygen from water, by employing a current.

The defending general in this battle may have disobeyed orders to retreat given by Queen Victoria in early 1884.

This is the only term appearing in the denominator of the Verhulst equation, and it was used to describe surveys of the Kaibab Plateau. As this condition is reached, K-shifting often occurs, while immediately after succession, r-strategists predominate, thriving because of low scarcity. Considering only current human use of the planet's net primary production suggests that the human population could double before reaching, for 10 points, this value at which population is at equilibrium, since crowding and resource scarcity forces birth and death rates to be equal.

He argued for an organic long-run model of culture change in his posthumous “inquiry into race relations in Africa”, The Dynamics of Culture Change. This man's dictum that “speech is a mode of action, not a countersign of thought” has been used by anthropologist Robin Roberts to suggest he is the founder of the sub-field of cultural pragmatics. He is acknowledged as the founder of anthropological functionalism, which he applied to his study of the Kula Ring Exchange in the Trobriand Islands.

answer: Operation {Market Garden}

Restrictions of the Allies' oil supplies prompted this plan to be accepted over that of Omar Bradley. It was meant to seize strategic bridges with light troops in the target Nazi occupied nation and then reinforce them with heavier ground troops. However, tactical problems associated with dropping paratroopers deep within enemy lines and underestimations of the strength of the German forces in Holland ruined it. For 10 points, identify this failed World War II operation that saw the largest airborne assault in history, though notably didn't see the seizure of the bridge at Arnhem, despite the securing of several other bridges in the Netherlands by the British.
