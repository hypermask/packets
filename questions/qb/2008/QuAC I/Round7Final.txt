answer: {Hall} effect

A quantized version of this effect states that conductance equals v times e squared over h, where e is the fundamental charge. That version was discovered by von Klitzing and posits the presence of positively charged “holes”. The basic principle underlying this is the Lorentz force, in which charge carriers subject to it initially drift away from the current line, resulting in an excess surface electrical charge on the side of the sample. For 10 points, identify this eponymous effect in which current flow perpendicular to an applied magnetic field generates an electric potential.
