answer: {Glaciers} (or {ice sheets}, {ice caps}, or anything {else suggesting large amounts} of {frozen water} before {randkluft} is mentioned)

The piteraq and williwaw forms of katabatic winds generally originate at these features. Deep holes that cut through these features are called moulins, and randklufts exist at the end of their corries, which also contain cracks called bergschrunds. Sheepbacks and kettle lakes are evidence for their former existence, as well as drumlins, eskers, and U-shaped valleys, which sometimes become fjords after these objects retreat. For 10 points, name these slow moving geological features that deposit moraines and are found in tidewater, continental, and alpine forms.

The second to last part of this work is named for the site where Jesus revealed himself to the Apostles, and is also the name of the camp that the Hussites built in Bohemia, “Tabor.” It was conceived of and premiered in pairs; the first of which begins with “The High Castle,” whose its theme is recalled in the next section, which begins with a rippling flute motif and is named for the river that runs through Prague, the Vltava, or “Moldau,”.

answer: ethers

The aryl varieties can be generated in the Ullman condensation, and a cyclic type of these compounds is formed when alkenes are treated with mcPBA. Their synthesis can be accomplished in a reaction of sodium alkoxide with an alkyl halide named for Williamson. Cyclic ones include tetrahydrofuran, oxirane, and epoxide, though a special polycyclic variety is dubbed the “crown” type. For 10 points, name these compounds, examples of which include the anesthetic diethyl variety.

answer: {Cavalier} Poets

The title of one poem by a member of this loose literary group asks, “Why So Pale and Wan?” Another member of the group was Thomas Carew (“carey”), while another crafted the famous lines “Stone walls do not a prison make/Nor iron bars a cage” in his “To Althea, from Prison” and depicted the group's commitment to courtly love and honor in his “Lucasta” poems. Including Sir John Suckling and Richard Lovelace, for 10 points, name this poetic group associated with the court of Charles I the name of which refers to their class, royalist sympathies, and opposition to the seriousness of the poetry of the age.

This man, who lent his voice to Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, will soon join the X-Men franchise. In addition to releasing solo albums like “Must B 21” and “Songs About Girls”, he was featured in a song which says “it don't mean a thang if you're looking at my…”, and several other lines ending abruptly in the Pussy Cat Dolls' “Beep”. He gained most of his fame, for working with Apl.de.ap and Fergie as a frontman for the Black Eyed Peas, but may be better known for a YouTube music video based on a Barack Obama speech.

Its so-called “new” incarnation, listed as the third one by Diogenes, embraced skepticism under its leader Carneades, who denied the possibility of a transcendent truth.

For 10 points, name this institution of learning notably led by Plato and often contrasted with the Lyceum.

A conserved one of these is predicted by Noether's theorem, and essential to the strong nuclear force is a color one, while a different one is conserved by Kirchhoff's second law. The method of “mirror” these is used to solve certain problems, which on a sphere are solved with the method of inversion. A magnetic kind of this would be generated by magnetic monopoles, which would in turn explain the quantization of another kind, as measured in Milliken's oil-drop experiment. For 10 points, identify this quantity, quantized in units of that on the electron.

Carter Druse shoots his father as they fight on opposite sides of the war in one of this man's works. In addition to “A Horseman in the Sky”, he wrote of a child who stumbles upon badly wounded and disfigured retreating soldiers and is revealed to be deaf. He wrote a work in which friendship is described as “a boat big enough to carry two in fair weather, but only one in foul,” and that work's reception earned him the nickname “Bitter.” This author of “Chickamunga” published his most famous work before disappearing in Mexico.

answer: {phalanx}

In its use in the 8th-through 5th century BCE, its proponents seemed to agree that an eight-rank-deep grouping was most effective. This was likely due to the common length of the doru used by its members, which is thought to have been about 7-9 feet, allowing the spearpoints of its first three lines to precede it. The shields of the hoplites in it were ranged to form a defensive front, allowing the formation to charge into an opposing line. Used to great effect at Marathon and later by Alexander the Great, for 10 points, name this military formation of ancient Greece with a name derived from the word for “finger.”

answer: {Caravaggio} [or {Michelangelo} de Merisi before mentioned]

His Death of the Virgin was viewed to be irreverent because it shows Mary quite physically dead. This was a few years after he completed three works for the Contarelli chapel for his best patron, Cardinal Del Monte. The head of the Knights of Malta commissioned his Beheading of St. John the Baptist and offered him protection after his slaying of Ranuccio Tomassoni over a tennis match. This master of chiaroscuro may be most well known for his tenebrism as seen in Supper at Emmaus and The Cardsharps. For 10 points, name this pugnacious artist of The Calling of St. Matthew.

answer: insulin

It consists of two polypeptide chains, one of which has an intra-chain disulfide bond and consists of 21 amino acids, the other consisting of 30 amino acids. In the absence of it, GSK3 is active, and its receptor acts through the PI-3 kinase pathway, which causes movement of GLUT4. Forming hexamers in solution, it was discovered by Banting and Macleod, and can stimulate fat cells to make leptin. Produced by beta cells of the pancreas, for 10 points, name this hormone that maintains a stable blood-sugar level with glucagon and whose deficiency can lead to diabetes.

Before undertaking his greatest feat, he ordered the Ubshu-kenna to submit to his authority if he was successful. On the E-Sagil Ziggurat, this figure is depicted as a snake-dragon holding a hoe-like tool called the marrn. His “majestic halo” and fierce glance killed Kingu, and then he sent a mighty wind into Kingu's consort, killing her and making of her ribs the vault of the heavens and earth. For 10 points, name this Babylonian deity, the slayer of the sky dragon Tiamat.

answer: Coming of Age in Samoa

The main critic of this work argued that the French explorer Bougainville's 1771 book Voyage around the World unduly influenced its author with its descriptions of free attitudes about sex. The only type of sexual prohibition described in the book is moetolo, or “sleep crawling,” in which a boy takes a girl by force while she sleeps. Meant by the author to help answer the question of whether the teen years were fraught sexually due to innate or societal expectations and later attacked by Derek Freeman, for 10 points, what is this anthropological work about adolescence in the title island by Margaret Mead?
