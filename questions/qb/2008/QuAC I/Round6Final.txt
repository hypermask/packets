answer: Noah {Webster}

Although not well-known for being a scientist, this man published the medical work A Brief History of Epidemic and Pestilential Diseases in addition to Experiments Respecting Dew. A better known work by this man that was dubbed “Blue-Backed” sold over 100 million copies, and led this man to lobby for a national copyright law. The original 1828 version of his most notable work is still popular with Evangelicals because so many of its entries are connected to Biblical scripture; it took him 27 years, during which he learned parts of over 26 languages. Best known for his Americanization of spelling, for 10 points, name this author of An American Dictionary of the English Language.

answer: ferromagnetism

As a result of the double-exchange mechanism, Heusler alloys do not exhibit this property. Substances exhibiting this property experience the Barkhausen effect, and the alignment within each domain decreases as the temperature increases towards the Curie point. Due to a property known as hysteresis, these materials tend to stay magnetized after being subjected to an external magnetic field. For 10 points, name this type of magnetism found in materials such as cobalt, nickel, and iron.

answer: John Stuart {Mill}

In 1823, this man was spent two days in jail for distributing a pamphlet advocating for the legal use of contraceptives by married women. He was a great friend of Thomas Carlyle, even after his housemaid burned the only manuscript of Carlyle's book on the French Revolution. His wife Harriet Taylor is credited with co-authoring his 1869 treatise arguing for the legal and intellectual equality of half the population, The Subjection of Women. That book utilizes the philosophy of his mentor, Jeremy Bentham, as did his book Utilitarianism. For 10 points, name this British utilitarian author of On Liberty.

answer: {Gideon} v. {Wainwright}

The conclusions of this case were later expanded by a decision in which Lewis Powell reluctantly concurred, Argersinger v. Hamlin. Tom C. Clark and John Marshall Harlan delivered the two concurring opinions, while Justice Hugo Black authored this decision which confirmed Powell v. Alabama while rejecting Betts v. Brady. Chief Justice Earl Warren presided over this case, whose decision ultimately led to the acquittal of a man accused of breaking into a Florida pool hall but denied his Sixth Amendment rights. For 10 points, which 1963 decision required states to provide defendants with an attorney if unable to provide their own?

answer: {strong} force/interaction [prompt on "{nuclear force}" or "{hadronic force}"]

The Yukawa interaction is used to describe this as mediated by pions, while its Langrangian predicts that its carriers are subject to it, leading to asymptotic freedom. That phenomenon can be predicted by an SU3 gauge theory, quantum chromodynamics, and this interaction, unlike its counterpart, is mediated by gluons. For 10 points, name this fundamental force holding together atomic nuclei whose relative strength is greater than the weak force.

answer: The {Planets} Suite

Its first movement uses an asymmetrical rhythm partly inspired by The Rite of Spring along with crashing tympani to evoke martial cadences. A theosophical work by Alan Leo helped inspire this work ending in an offstage wordless women's chorus, which includes parts subtitled “The Magician” and “The Bringer of Jollity”. The fact that its composer did not create an eighth movement was vindicated in 2006 when it was declared that Pluto would no longer be appropriate for inclusion anyway. For 10 poins, name this suite by Gustav Holst, including sections like “Saturn, the Bringer of Old Age” and “Mars, the Bringer of War”?

answer: {Barenaked Ladies}

The rare "Yellow Tape" record contains some of this band's early hits, and the bassist's brother was replaced by Tyler Stewart when he went abroad as an exchange student. Their first CD, Gordon, was popular in Canada, but they did not reach the top of the charts in the US until they released “Stunt”, which appropriately spent one week at the top of the Billboard 100. In another song, this band proclaims that the title state would allow them to “buy you a fur coat—but not a real fur coat, that's cruel.” For ten points, name this rock band that sings “If I Had $1,000,000” and “Pinch Me”, that actually consists of five fully-clothed men.

This author wrote of a historical knight who lost his arm and had it replaced with an iron prosthetic in his drama Gotz von Berlichingen. He used 19th-century ideas about chemical interactions as motif for human relationships in his novel Elective Affinities, and in a more famous work he depicted suicide of the title character because he cannot have Lotte, a novel which helped inaugurate the Sturm und Drang movement.

One type of them is produced in the Parker-Sochacki method for solving systems of differential equations. A type involving natural logarithms is named for Mercator, and a type that includes terms of negative degree is named for Laurent. One type that uses a function's derivatives to expand it about the point zero is named for MacLaurin and is a special case of the one named for Taylor. For 10 points, name this term that is used to describe an ordered set of terms, such as 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, which is an example of the geometric type.

answer: Brazil

The first ruler of this nation established its independence in the “Fico” speech, and his son put forth the “Golden Law”, which freed this country's slaves.

Another president founded an airplane-shaped capital designed by Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemayer, though this nation currently headed by Luiz Lula da Silva was originally founded by its first emperor Pedro I.

According to one story, it was constructed at Carduel and was given as a gift to Leodegraunce. Its most famous owner received it when he married Leodegraunce's daughter, and according to the Roman de Brut, it was built after knights fought over a prime location near the king during a Christmas feast. It was designed so no individual was greater than any other, and people who have sat here include Yvaine, Percival, and Galahad.

He wrote about a boy who loses his hand and then his life in one work, and one of this man's poems describes how “Leaf subsides to leaf, so Eden sank to grief.” The narrator of another poem states that from what he's “tasted of desire” he would choose one of the title methods of destruction in “Fire and Ice”, and he claimed that “One could do worse than be a swinger of birches” in a poem titled “Birches”.

answer: axons

The proteins netrin and slit are involved in their guidance, the latter of which requires the receptor known as robo. When they are cut, a process known as Wallerian degeneration occurs, and the largest of these structures has been studied in giant squid. Their branches are sometimes known as collaterals, and the area where they join the soma or cell body, is known as a namesake hillock. Featuring nodes of Ranvier along their length, these are, for 10 points, what thin tube-like structures that are often covered in myelin, and can conduct action potentials in neurons?

While a first-year Whig congressman, this politician demanded that President Polk live up to his promise identifying where American blood was spilt in Mexico, also known as this man's “spot resolutions”.

Avenging that loss by being elected the first-ever Republican president was, for 10 points, what man, the first president to be assassinated?

Some of the most famous men to hold this position include Photius in the 10th century and Michael Cerlularias, who oversaw the East-West Schism. Another holder was the golden-mouthed John Chrysostom, who is recognized as a saint by the Coptic Orthodox Church.
