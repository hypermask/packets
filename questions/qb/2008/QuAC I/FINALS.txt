answer: {Four Color} Map Theorem [accept {Guthrie's conjecture} until mentioned]

In 2000, an Indian used Eilenberg modules and Hall matchings to prove this statement, which degenerates into the Hadwiger Conjecture when n=5. Perhaps first proposed by Francis Guthrie, who lends it an alternate name, this problem was thought to be proven by the Kempe algorithm. Though it was solved by Appel and Haken in 1976 using computer-generated configurations, it turns out this theorem can be considered a special case of the Heawood conjecture, which assigns a topological space an upper limit on chromatic numbers. For 10 points, name this theorem, which states that a map may be filled with a certain number of colors so that adjacent regions are different colors.

answer: {oxidation} [do not accept {redox}]

Oxalyl chloride and DMSO are employed in the Swern variety, and osmium tetroxide is used to bring about this process in alkenes. Tollens' Reagent initiates this process leading to a silver mirror in the presence of aldehydes because ketones typically do not undergo it. The Jones type uses chromic acid to transform alcohols into ketones and carboxylic acids, thus increasing the number of carbon-oxygen bonds, one way of achieving this process. Occurring when a molecule or atom loses electrons, for 10 points, is what type of reaction often coupled with a reduction?
