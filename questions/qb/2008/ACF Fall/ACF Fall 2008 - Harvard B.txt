answer: {ozone} [accept: {O3}]

This compound participates in the Griesenbaum reaction along with pentane, which results in a tetra-substitution in a five member ring. Indigo trisulfonate can be used to quantitatively assess the presence of this compound in water. It participates in a reaction that follows the Criegee mechanism, and is a 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction occurring in the presence of dichloromethane that creates ketones or aldehydes from alkenes. Having a blue color, it is formed during lightning, while its name comes from its foul smell and halocarbons are able to catalyze the degradation of this compound in the atmosphere.

answer: {quantum numbers} [accept {angular momentum quantum numbers} before “{Hamiltonian}”]

For a constant magnetic field, the energy of the anomalous Zeeman effect is proportional to a function of these values known as the Landé g-factor. In any system, there is one of these for each operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian and one given by the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues.  The radius of electron orbitals in the Bohr model is proportional to that value squared, and they are constant as additional electrons are added according to the Aufbau principle.  No two fermions can have the same value for these according to the Pauli exclusion principle. For 10 points, name these values, which describe among other things the shell, subshell, and spin values for an electron.
