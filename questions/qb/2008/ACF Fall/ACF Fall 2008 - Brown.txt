In an April fool's column, Martin Gardner claimed that "e to the pi radical 163" is one of these. The Eisenstein ones are proper supersets that are extended with complex numbers. They form an Abelian group when endowed with addition and a commutative ring when endowed with addition and multiplication, but they are not a field, as they lack multiplicative inverses. As a set, they have cardinality "aleph 0", although they cannot be enumerated monotonically. The floor and ceiling functions yield, for 10 points, what type or numbers represented with a bold “Z,” the set that is exactly the union of the natural numbers, their additive inverses, and zero.

Matthew Marryott inspired an alteration to them contained in Knatchbull's Act, while the creation of Select Vestries was allowed by ones named for William Sturges Bourne.

An amendment to one of them created the Speenhamland system, and they were replaced by the Local Government Act of 1929.  The Old one was passed under Elizabeth I, while the New one of 1834 ended outdoor relief and led to a scandal at Andover, one of many workhouses.

answer: {conservative}

In 1975, Vujanovic extended Noether's theorem to this type of system, and the presence of a term proportional to the quantity "x-squared minus one" results in the Van der Pol oscillator not being this type of system.  These systems have Hamiltonians that do not explicitly depend on time, and Helmholtz decomposition shows that one negative term can represent this type of field. Fields of this type have no curl, and can be described as the gradient of a scalar potential.  For 10 points, identify this adjective which refers to systems in which the amount of work done is independent of the path, and describes fields such as the gravitational and electric fields in which no energy is lost.
