answer: the {Michelson}-{Morley} experiment

The Sagnac effect was discovered in an experiment which built upon this experiment and disproved the "ballistic theory." One experiment very similar to it used varying lengths of an object to show that the time difference is constant, thus falsifying the Fitzgerald-Lorentz hypothesis. The apparatus used in it was placed on a marble slab which was rotated in mercury to allow for all orientations of a certain "wind" to equally affect the outcome, and one of its namesakes developed the interferometer used in this experiment. For 10 points, identify this experiment, which showed no change in the velocity of light due to ether drift, and thus debunked the theory of the luminiferous ether.
