answer: {Riemann zeta} function [prompt on partial]

When the parameter is set to one, it can be expanded as a series whose coefficients are Stieltjes constants, and it can be evaluated using Parseval's theorem. A generalization of it is called the Hurwitz function, and it resembles a p-series. When evaluated at 2, it gives the solution to the Basel problem, and Ramanujan showed that it is equal to minus one twelfths when evaluated at negative one. 1.5 million roots have been shown to lie on the critical strip, but it is not known whether all roots have a real part 1/2, and this function is closely associated with the prime number theorem. For 10 points, identify this function named for a German mathematician who has a namesake hypothesis

answer: {inner} core [prompt on {core} until “{F}-{layer}”]

Its translational motions are commonly called Slichter modes, and early models for it included a 450 km thick F-layer on its exterior. An important discovery about its differential rotation was made by Dziewonski, and it was hypothesized by Inge Lehmann in 1936. The cause of faster propagation of seismic waves parallel to earth's rotation axis in this region is uncertain, and its interactions with the region above it generate the earth's magnetic field according to the geodynamo theory. For 10 points, identify this region composed mainly of a iron-nickel alloy, which may be found below the outer core.

answer: {calcite}

Ancient forms of this material have been found to contain tetravalent uranium. Glendonite is an example of this material which retains the shape of ikatite, which is itself a hydrated form of this mineral. Vaterite and aragonite are polymorphs of this substance, which is used as the standard for 3 on Mohs hardness scale, and exhibits perfect rhombohedral cleavage along 3 planes. A special example of it found in standing waters in caves is called Dogtooth spar, and it is also found in marble and limestone. For 10 points, identify this mineral that is mostly made of calcium carbonate.
