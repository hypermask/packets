He studied the responses to people cutting into lines or asking for someone to give up their seat on the subway, and he asked people to send packages to those most likely to know the target in his small world experiment.  Variations on his most famous experiment showed higher stress rates in women, though they were just as likely to continue operating the machine.

answer: {Arrhenius} equation

A cruder form of it was proposed by Wilhelmy in 1858, and its namesake observed the implications of this statement when equilibrium of reactive and unreactive molecules is considered in the van't Hoff equation. A T to m term is sometimes introduced to it, as a quantity in it is approximated to be independent of temperature. That quantity accounts for the rate and orientation of collisions is called the pre exponential factor. One form of it states that the natural log of the equilibrium constant has a inverse relationship with one over T, and it allows one to relate the equilibrium constant with activation energy. For 10 points, identify this equation named for the Swedish chemist.
