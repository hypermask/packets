answer: {quantum computers}

Topological ones could use anyons to avoid the problem of decoherence. These objects use Hadamard gates, and the no cloning theorem makes error correction difficult for them. One of them is used in the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and one of them allows the use of Grover's algorithm to search through an unsorted database in sublinear time. They can use Shor's Algorithm to factor primes in “order log cubed of n” time, and their individual elements are represented by two-state systems. Loss and Vincenzo have proposed one constructed of a certain type of dot. For 10 points, name these devices that store information in the form of superpositions of ones and zeroes, in qubits.

answer: {Tay}-{Sachs} disease

Sandhoff disease is related to this disease, and the metabolism of 4-methyl-lumbelli-ferone is used in the biochemical test which detects this disease. It is caused by a mutation in the HEXA gene, which leads to a deficiency of hexosaminidase A.
