answer: {Cyprus}

One attack on this place was thwarted when the Sicilian pirate Margarito of Brinidisi made off with some unattended ships. It would later change hands after the battle of Tremetusia, when Isaac Comnenos took Berengaria captive, leading to an invasion by Richard I. It was briefly held by the Templars before they sold it to the reigning king of Jerusalem, Guy of Lusignan. Famagusta was the last of its strongholds to fall to the Ottomans, under whose control the native Greek majority were repressed by the Turkish minority. For 10 points, name this island, which was invaded by Turkey in 1974 and remains divided along ethnic lines today.

answer: George {Santayana}

This man claimed that if Hamlet were reported in a newspaper, it wouldn't be transcendent, showing that "the expression of the object" of art can transform tragedy into beauty. In one work he offered sprit, truth, essence, and matter as the four categories of reality, and he argued that no real knowledge can be gained in an "instant of awareness" in a work that asserts belief does not derive from reasoning, but is an inevitable idea necessary for a man to act. This thinker wrote A Sense of Beauty and Realms of Being. For 10 points, name this author of Skepticism and Animal Faith, who said, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."

He executed the Earl of Warwick, the last man to bear the name Plantagenet. He ended a rebellion at the Battle of Stoke, defeating Lincoln and the pretender Lambert Simnel, and he faced another rebellion from Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be the younger son of Edward IV. He came to power with the help of Northumberland and the Stanleys, who switched allegiances at Bosworth Field. For 10 points, name this man, who overthrew Richard III and ended the Wars of the Roses, the first Tudor king of England.

answer: The Importance of Being {Earnest}

One man in this work is offended when he cannot find the source of a name engraved on a cigarette case, and later quips that only relatives or creditors ring in a “Wagnerian manner” after his aunt finds that all of the cucumber sandwiches are gone. One character tells a man she just met that they've been engaged three months, and writes letters three times a week in her diary. Another character gets Reverend Chasuble to rechristen him. Miss Prism's revelation that she left a baby in a bag in a cloakroom leads Lady Bracknell to approve Gwendolen Fairfax's marriage to Jack Worthing. For 10 points, name this play about the significance of a certain name, by Oscar Wilde.

answer: Mackenzie River

Fort Good Hope lies along this river, which is located west of the Franklin mountains after passing by Wrigley. The Laird River joins it near Fort Simpson, and Richards Island is the largest island located near its delta, which lies to the west of Richardson Mountains and is bounded by Shoalwater Bay. It initially flows to the west, south of Horn Plateau, but turns north, running parallel to its namesake mountains eventually emptying into the Beaufort Sea. It originates at the Great Slave Lake, and is named for a man, who initially called it “Disappointment River” after navigating its course in 1789. For 10 points, name this longest river in Canada.

answer: {viscosity}

Sutherland's formula gives this quantity for ideal gases, and like thermal conductivity, it can be found by applying Green-Kubo relations to the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients. Euler's fluid equations assume a zero value for this quantity, and the Grashof number is inversely proportional to its square. The no-slip condition generally exacerbates its effects, and it has dynamic and kinematic varieties. The Reynolds number is inversely proportional to this quantity, and it is constant for Newtonian fluids. For 10 points, identify this quantity, the ratio of shear stress to shear velocity, used as a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow.

answer: {knowledge} [prompt on {epistemology}]

Descartes proposed a thought experiment in which all one has of this is due to a demon, and Quine's argument that no statement can be truly analytic allows him to support a doctrine holding that certainty in this is impossible, called fallibilism. The Gettier problem questions the traditional formulation that a statement's truth and its belief implies that it is this, while another philosopher discussed how this can be derived either through statements about “relations of ideas” or through “matters of fact” in Hume's fork. For 10 points, identify this concept defined as the intersection of what is true and believed, the theory of which is called epistemology.

A dissimilarity characteristic for these objects is defined by Otter's theorem and is useful for analyzing Husimi ones. Rosa's conjecture concerns whether they may be gracefully labeled. The 2-3 version is a special variety of the B version of them. The zig, zig-zig, and zig-zag steps are used in creating the “splay” type of them, which uses much less memory than the AVL and red-black varieties. Kruskal and Prim name algorithms for finding their minimum spanning variety. For 10 points, name this class of graphs without double edges or cycles, which, in computer science, is a data structure that has a binary search variety, whose bottommost nodes are called leaves.

answer: St. {Christopher} [or St. {Christoforos}]

Jacobus de Voragine's Golden Legend relates that this figure was a king of Canaan inspired by a hermit to take up the occupation for which he was most famous. He was martyred during the persecutions of Decius, where he was decapitated and his large body was dragged through the streets, and in some stories he is described as a dog-headed cannibal. The most famous legend surrounding this figure centered on a child who turned his staff into a palm tree after this man helped him cross a raging stream. For 10 points, name this patron saint of travelers, who once carried a very heavy Christ child across a river, an act from which his name is derived.

answer: {Plasmodium}

The presence of Schuffner's dots indicates infection by members of it, and its erythrocytic stage proceeds from merozoite to trophozoite to schizont and follows repeated segmentation at the end of the liver stage. Immunity to the disease it causes is conferred by carrying an allele of sickle-cell anemia, therefore demonstrating the heterozygote advantage. Varieties that infect birds are carried by Culex, and a phase of male gametogenesis called exflagellation was used to observe its falciparum species. This microorganism is commonly transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. For 10 points, identify this genus of protazoa that causes malaria.

answer: {velocity} of money

Generally, output shocks cause this quantity to move in the same direction as deflated stock prices, but move in opposite ways from normal stock prices. Serletis treats variations in it as being a random walk, and Keynes notably believed this quantity was unstable, changing with the interest rate. It may be determined nationally as the ratio between the GDP and the money supply, while Irving Fisher believed it is stable and independent of the other variables in his quantity theory of money, where it can be given by his equation of exchange as “PT over M.” For 10 points, give this term denoting how often a unit of money is spent over a time interval.

answer: {Grignard} reagents [prompt on {alkyl magnesium halides} or {aryl magnesium halides}]

The efficacy of the Boord olefin synthesis prevents ones with vicinal alkoxy groups from being synthesized. Particularly hindered ones react by single-electron transfer, but normally their namesake reaction uses two equivalents of them to generate a six-membered ring for a transition state. Reactions involving them must be carried out in aprotic solvents, and the only way to produce ones incorporating fluorine requires a metal powder named for Rieke. For 10 points, name these organometallic reagents, most commonly used as nucleophiles for reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols, which could be known as alkyl or aryl magnesium halides.

The northlander Trendhorn got his eye put out by a chess piece when he was spying on this figure, while Fergus mac Roich was prevented by his geis from pursuing her. She was heard to cry out while still in her mother's womb, leading the druid Cathbad to prophesy that she would bring about the downfall of her house. Though she was the daughter of Feidlimid, the king decreed that she must be raised by Leabharcham, and she eventually fell in love with the brother of Ardan and Ainnle, Naoise mac Uisnech. For 10 points, identify this woman, who committed suicide after being recaptured by Conchobar mac Nessa, a Celtic figure whose beauty brought about much sadness.

answer: {intrusions}

The Noril's-Talnakh type of these structures are ultramafic examples thought to have been created by plume magmatism. The “bell jar” type of these are special cases of the bysmalith type, and dedimentary ones may develop when excessive lithostatic pressure allows fluid pressure to rise high enough to crack a stratum of rock and carry sediment up the crack. Especially large ones are frequently called batholiths, but the best known varieties are mostly vertical and mostly horizontal, called, respectively, dikes and sills. For 10 points, give the term that usually denotes a formation of crystallized magma underground, a deposit of plutonic igneous rock.
