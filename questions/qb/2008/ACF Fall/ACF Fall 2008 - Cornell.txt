answer: Index of Refraction [or Refractive Index]

The Abbe number is defined in terms of this quantity, which can be found using Cauchy's or Sellmeier's equation.  It is equal to the square root of the product of the relative permeability and the relative permittivity of the material, and metamaterials could have a negative value for this quantity.  The arctangent of the ratio between two materials' values for this gives Brewster's Angle.

For 10 points, name this property which governs a namesake effect in which a beam of light is bent as it passes between mediums.

The Kidd glycoproteins present on their surface act as urea transporters. Spectrin and ankyrin are found in the cytoskeletal network of these cells and antibodies on their surface are detected by the direct Coombs test. They express high levels of CD47, which prevents phagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen, and kidneys release EPO which stimulate the production of these. Excess production of them results in polycythemia, and their count is depressed in anemia. Produced in the bone marrow, they are biconcave and lack nuclei.
