answer: {translation} [accept {translocation} until “{EF}-{Tu}”]

LepA can reverse this process, and in some organisms, this process sees protein EF-3 utilize ATP to reduce affinity for the substrate at L1. The characteristic ratcheting mechanism of this process involves GTP hydrolysis by EF-G, while EF-Tu, which works as a proofreader, also employs GTP to bind the substrate. Beginning with binding to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes, it sees movement of the substrates through aminoacyl, peptidyl, and exit sites. This process ends when the nascent peptide is complete and the two subunits dissociate.
