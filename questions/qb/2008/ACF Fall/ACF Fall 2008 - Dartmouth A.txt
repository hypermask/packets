answer: {Hall} Effect [accept {fractional quantum Hall effect} or {quantum Hall effect}]

One result of this effect was explained by the creation of quasiparticles in a quantum fluid by Laughlin, and Dyakonov and Perel predicted a version of it dependent on spin.  It can be used to find hole density in a semiconductor, and von Klitzing showed that under certain situations this effect is quantized.  This effect distinguishes between a negative current and a positive current flowing in the opposite direction, and it creates a Lorentz force, resulting in the deflection of charge carriers by a magnetic field.

answer: {ethylene} [accept {C2H4} until mentioned; accept {ethene}]

This compound is the starting ingredient in an industrial process where it complexes with palladium tetrachloride and is attacked by a water molecule to form an alcohol intermediate; that process gives acetaldehyde from this compound and is called the Wacker process.

answer: {ATP synthase} [or {adenosine tri}-{phosphate synthase}]

In an important experiment, its beta subunits were bonded to nickel on a glass surface, and an actin filament attached to its gamma subunit was observed. Its mechanism was elucidated in an experiment when sunlight was shone towards artifical vesicles containing bacteriorhodopsin, and it is inhibited by DCCD and oligomycin. The gamma subunit of the F0 rotates as protons pass through, and the proton motive force releases the product of this enzyme. For 10 points, identify this enzyme present in the mitochondrion, which uses chemiosmosis to catalyze the production of a high energy molecule by phophorylating ADP.

answer: marginal revenue [prompt on {MR}]

This must decrease as rival firms' aggregate output increases in order for Cournot competition to hold, and if a strictly positive subsistence level is introduced to a CES function, this quantity becomes non-monotonic. It is given by price times the quantity 1 minus 1 over demand elasticity, showing that its sign is an indicator of elasticity. In oligopolies, this curve has a jump due to the kinked demand curve, and in monopolies, a deadweight loss is caused because this curve, and not demand, determines quantity sold. For 10 points, name this curve that generally marks equilibrium where it meets marginal cost, and which measures the added revenue of an additional unit sold.
