answer: {electron capture} [prompt on {K}-{capture}]

For elements with low atomic numbers, the Auger process competes with the fluorescence that is characteristic of this process. Potassium-argon dating methods are valuable since all of the argon arises from potassium by this radioactive transition rather than chemically. The lighter isotopes of transition metals, such as silver-105, tend to decay by this process. Positron emission competes with this process, which results in neutron and a neutrino, the latter of which gets ejected. Despite the change in atomic number, the total number of nucleons is conserved. For 10 points, name this process that sees the nucleus taking a namesake negatively charged particle from the K shell.
