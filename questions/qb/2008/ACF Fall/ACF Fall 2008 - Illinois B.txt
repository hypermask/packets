answer: {Henderson}-{Hasselbalch} Equation

One quantity in this equation can be expressed as one minus theta over theta where theta is the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. It can be applied to calculate the net charge on a protein at a given pH and is considered an approximation of the law of mass action applied to one species. This equation is less useful in extremely dilute solutions and when dealing with extremely strong acids or bases, and it ignores the minor dissociation of water and also hydrolysis of bases. For 10 points, identify this equation which relates the log of the ratio of conjugate base over acid and pKa to pH which is useful in characterizing buffer systems.

answer: {Quicksort}

In 1999, McIlroy created an adversary for this algorithm that guarantees that it will run in worst-case time. Its worst-case runtime can be avoided by switching to heapsort after a certain recursion depth, a construction known as introsort. Like mergesort, it is easily parallelizable, and its runtime can be decreased by first selecting the median of the unsorted input list. It was invented by C.A.R. Hoare, and its second phase is the partition function, which splits the original list into lists of elements that are greater or less than the chosen pivot value. For 10 points, identify this divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm which runs in big O of n log n time, named for its speed.
