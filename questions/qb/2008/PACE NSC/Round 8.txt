answer: bryophytes

The male and female sexual organs of this divisions species are known as antheridia and archegonia. The upper portion of the archegonia acts as a cap to the sporophyte, and is called calyptra. Their life cycle begins when a protonema is produced from a haploid spore, and their water transporting tissue is called a hydroid, as they do not possess a vascular system. For 10 points, identify this plantae division which contains hornworts, liverworts, and mosses.

answer: {Crab} Nebula [accept {Crab} after “{nebula}”]

Images observed in 1996 found that this object emits two streams of polar winds which initiate a shock front dubbed a “dancing sprite” by scientists. In January 2003, Titan's transit of it allowed astronomers to use this object's x-rays to measure that moon's atmospheric thickness. Iosif Shkolvsky suggested that synchrotron radiation could be emerging from this remnant of SN 1054, a supernova discovered by Chinese astronomers. For 10 points, name this first member of the Messier catalog, a pulsar wind nebula found in Taurus and named for a crustacean.

answer: the {Stanford prison} experiment

One of its creators, Carlo Prescott, maintains that conclusions drawn from this event are false because he gave participants specific instructions drawn from a seventeen-year period of his own life. The fake southern accent adopted by a participant who called himself "John Wayne" tipped off Christine Maslach that this event in Jordan Hall needed to be stopped, as did the use of bags over subjects' heads. For 10 points, name this study, performed by Philip Zimbardo, in which men were assigned to roleplay as "guards" or "inmates" at a California university.

Developed at the urging of Henry Kaiser, its design involved inventing the "artificial feel system" and meeting a World War II mandate to avoid using materials crucial to the military. Intended to have a seating capacity of 750, it used the Duramold technique to impregnate plastic into the substance which gave it its name. For 10 points, name this eight-engine vehicle, intended as a troop transport, which Howard Hughes spent five years building in order to prove that large wooden aircraft could fly, before it was abandoned after only one mile in the air.

answer: {Chinese Exclusion} Act

The "paper son" scheme was used to bypass this law, which was extended for ten years by the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902. Repealed by the Magnuson Act during World War II, a side effect of it was the Webb Alien Land Law. Denis Kearney, the head of the Workingmen's Party of California, was one of its chief proponents, and Benjamin Harrison opposed it because he believed that it violated the Burlingame Treaty of 1868. For 10 points, name this 1882 law that restricted immigration to the United States from a certain Asian country.

answer: {Hall} effect

The quantum spin type initially proposed by Kane and Mele was developed based on Haldane's graphene model and was realized in mercury telluride quantum wells in 2007. This phenomenon is largely brought about due to the effect of the Lorentz force. That force leads to a dearth of mobile charge on one side of the material resulting in a difference in potential across it. For 10 points, identify this effect that describes the presence of voltage across a conductor caused by a perpendicular magnetic field acting on a current in the conductor.

One form of it uses a reaction between iodine and sulfur dioxide to measure the presence of water, and is named for Fischer. A conductometric version of performing it requires the temperature to be constant, while the redox variety of it uses a potentiometer. This process is generally represented by a sigmoid curves, whose midpoint usually gives the equivalence point. For 10 points, identify this method used to find the concentration of an unknown sample, notably used with acids and bases.
