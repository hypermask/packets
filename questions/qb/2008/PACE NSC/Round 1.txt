answer: {superfluid} [or {superfluidity}]

Landau proposed that excitations in these propagate via “rotons,” and glitches are thought to occur in pulsars when neutrons turn into these, explaining their unusual vorticity. They can also form Rollin films, which exhibit the Onnes effect, wherein capillary forces acting on them are greater than gravity, and they have infinite thermal conductivity. Occurring below the lambda point for helium, for 10 points, identify this property exhibited by a liquid which has zero viscosity.

A 1925 paper arguing against skepticism, written by G.E. Moore, was titled "A Defense of" this. It was the primary method of reasoning used in the treatises of Claude Buffier, who influenced a circle including Dugald Stewart and Thomas Reid which exalted it in Scotland. From 1816 to 1870, it was declared the official philosophy of France, and this phrase also titled a work which blamed hereditary succession of kingship and the failure to immediately declare independence for the troubles of colonial America.

answer: inflation

One model for explaining this phenomenon relies on the assumption that productive capacity is at its maximum and advocates controlling it via the quantity theory. The "gap" named for this happens when government spending is greater than the difference between production and consumption. Subsidy programs for needed labor can cause the "demand-pull" variety, while the normal kind experienced in the first world is "cost-push." or 10 points, name this phenomenon in which more money is required to buy the same goods, causing a drop in the value of money.

This quantity is classically three times Boltzmann's constant for any crystal, but that breaks down when the temperature is less than the Debye temperature, when the law of Dulong and Petit for this fails. For an ideal gas, the isochoric form is given by the number of molecular degrees of freedom times Boltzmann's constant over two.

answer: {nondisjunction}

In some cases, this process is presaged by increased recombination in the pericentromeric region of diagrams that show this process, which lends credence to the idea that the two stages during which this can occur are “entangled”; those two stages uniquely see this occur equally frequently in Patau syndrome. This process can occur during meiosis I or II, depending on whether a tetrad or sister chromatids fail to unbind. For 10 points, name this failure of genes to separate properly, which leads to monosomy or trisomy, like in Down syndrome.
