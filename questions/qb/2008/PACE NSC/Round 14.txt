answer: {p} orbital

In the split method for studying these entities, the wave function remains continuous, but a discontinuity in the gradient split function arises in the nodal plane. In Diels-Alder reactions, it is the overlap of these that drives bond formation, and, for increasing energy, they first appear in the L-region. They interact in conjugated systems in dienes or allyl radicals, where just a single electron is present in one of these objects, which has azimuthal quantum number one. For 10 points, name this dumbbell-shaped region of an atom involved in pi bonds, which is filled after the s orbital.
