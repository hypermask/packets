answer: {peptide} bonds

These structures form a bridge between the molecules present at P sites and A sites, while their phi and psi angles can be visualized on a Ramachandran plot.

They are structurally classified as amides, as they are formed from the dehydration of a carboxylic acid and an amine group. Formed during the elongation stage of translation, for 10 points, identify these bonds that link amino acids together.

answer: {linear momentum} [prompt on momentum; do not accept “angular momentum”]

In translational motion, Noether's Theorem states that invariance of physical systems leads to its common treatment in classical mechanics. For objects without rest mass, it is given as energy over the speed of light or Planck's constant over wavelength. In quantum mechanics, it is a conjugate variable with position, and in classical mechanics, its change is given as the time integral of force, also known as impulse. For 10 points, name this physical quantity which is conserved in closed, isolated systems, commonly defined as the product of mass and the velocity.

answer: transpiration

A study of sphingosine kinase in Arabidopsis cells showed that it must work in conjunction with the hormone ABA in the promotion and inhibition of this process. Blue light and temperature conditions can also help to regulate it, and this process is responsible for a 97% loss of wet mass in most plants. It is mediated by the inflow of potassium and water forcing guard cells to bend and form openings in the leaf.
