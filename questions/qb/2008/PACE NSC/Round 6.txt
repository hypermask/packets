answer: {Planck's} blackbody distribution or function or law

It is a special case of the Bose-Einstein distribution with chemical potential zero, mass zero, and occupancy two. This function achieves a maximum at about 2.8 times the kinetic temperature since it is proportional to frequency cubed over one minus e to the frequency-energy equivalent over kinetic temperature; it thus converges to 0 at high frequency, unlike the Rayleigh-Jeans law that it replaced. For 10 points, name this law governing blackbody radiation, named for a German pioneer in quantum mechanics.
