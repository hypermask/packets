answer: second law of thermodynamics

Its apparent violation of T-symmetry was resolved with the H-theorem developed by Boltzmann. It can be mathematically stated as the indefinite integral of the reciprocal of temperature with respect to heat is always positive, while a thought experiment in which it is violated is called Maxwell's Demon. Equivalent to the statement that not all heat of a system can be converted to useful work, it was first posited by Rudolph Clausius. For 10 points, identify this law which states that the entropy of the universe always increases.

answer: {precession}

NMR-related imaging is based on the fact that resonant frequencies of nuclei experience the Larmor type of this and are proportional to magnetic field strength. For the torque-induced type, one can calculate velocity of this by dividing torque by spin angular momentum, a quantity often computed for the gyroscopic type and important in gyrocompasses. For 10 points, name this phenomenon where the axis of a rotating object changes direction, which can be applied in astronomy to Earth's changing axis as it revolves and rotates.

answer: {phloem}

The plasmodesmata mediates the diffusion via the symplastic pathway in this tissue. Specialized cells found here include the albuminous cells, though they are replaced by companion cells in angiosperms. Ernst Munch hypothesized a mechanism for the translocation for this tissue, wherein a gradient is created and turgor pressure becomes the primary actor. They also contain the sieve elements and sieve cells which perform their most important function. For 10 points, identify this tissue which is used to transport nutrients, and is present in the inner layer of bark.

answer: {Taylor} series

An algorithm for solving differential equations in terms of a specific type of one is called the Parker-Sochacki method. For an analytic function whose derivatives are all zero in some circular radius, one of these can be used to show that the function is explicitly zero within that radius. Laurent expanded on this to include negative degrees, and one is commonly used to prove Euler's formula. For 10 points, identify this expansion of a function in terms of its derivatives at a point, a type of which is the Maclaurin series.

answer: {four color} map theorem

This idea was thought to be first suggested by Francis Guthrie, giving it an alternative name, though Arthur Cayley may have been the first to address it. An attempt to prove this theorem was the Kempe algorithm, and the Heawood conjecture degenerates into it when the genus of the space is zero. It was eventually proven by Haken and Appel in 1976 using computer-generated configurations. For 10 points, identify this theorem stating that a map may be filled with a certain sufficient number of colors such that adjacent regions are different colors.

Hamlin Hannibal Garland wrote the line “O to dream of the plain” in a poem titled “In" this entity.” Another poem titled after this substance urges the reader to “shovel them under” and ponders whether in two or ten years, passengers will ask the conductor “What place is this? / Where are we now?,” unaware that they are at Gettysburg, Ypres, Verdun, Austerlitz, or Waterloo.
