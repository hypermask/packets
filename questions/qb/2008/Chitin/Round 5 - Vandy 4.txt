answer: {kinetic} theory of gases [prompt on "{collision}" {theory}]

Early pioneers of this theory included Waterston and Daniel Bernoulli, who discussed it in his Hydrodynamica. The Knudsen regime is a more recent expansion of it, as are higher order virial expansions. Some of this theory's assumptions are that atoms have negligible volume, elastically collide with each other, and have negligible interactions with each other. For 10 points, name this theory that describes the macroscopic properties of gases largely through the Maxwell-Boltzman distribution of their velocities as they undergo motion.

answer: {adrenaline} [accept {epinephrine} before it's read]

Unlike its precursor molecule, it is not psychoactive. Its synthesis from that precursor involves PNMT catalyzing the methylation of an amine group in chromaffin cells, which overproduce this molecule in pheo-chromo-cytomas.  Its binding to alpha receptors results in contraction of smooth muscle, while its binding to beta receptors can result in lypolysis and smooth muscle relaxation, especially in arteries leading to lungs and skeletal muscles. For 10 points, name this molecule behind the "fight or flight" response, also known as epinephrine and produced in its namesake gland.

answer: {Democracy} in America

Kurt Vonnegut derided anyone who had not read this work as a “twerp.” It prophesied the rise of Russia in addition to celebrating the separation of church and state, and it was written as a result of a year-long trip that its author and a colleague took at the behest of their government to study the American prison system.  It famously warns of the dangers of a tyranny of the majority, or the “despotism” of the titular entity.  For 10 points, name this important work of political theory, written in 1835 by Alexis de Tocqueville about the form of government in the U.S.

answer: The {Love Song} of {J Alfred Prufrock}

In this poem, the writer references Hesiod in discussing "Time for all the works and days of hands," and Marvell in wishing "To have squeezed the universe into a ball." Opening with an epigraph that is an interchange between the traitor Guido da Montefeltro and Dante, the narrator pessimistically examines his existence, saying "Do I dare/ disturb the universe/ in a minute there is time."  He also denies any of his ambitions, saying "No! I am not Prince Hamlet nor was meant to be."

One aspect of this property was confirmed in an experiment that fired silver atoms through an inhomogeneous magnetic field.  That experiment, performed by Stern and Gerlach, showed that this property was quantized. Fine structure refers to splitting spectral lines due to coupling between it and an electron's orbital angular momentum.  Pauli names a set of matrices associated with it, and was the first to propose it as a quantum number. For 10 points, name this property that is an integer for bosons and half integer for fermions, a particle's intrinsic angular momentum.

The nearby city of Borsippa had a shrine to Nabu, the son of this city's chief god, Marduk.

Geologists speculate that it was once a remnant of a former inland sea that continuously grows and shrinks over 3 billion year spans; this explains why its depth is only 11 meters.  Cameroon and Niger were once in conflict over who actually had control of this lake, but the dispute was settled when its namesake country claimed it.
