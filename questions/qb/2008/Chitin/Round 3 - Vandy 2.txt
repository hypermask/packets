answer: {viscosity}

For an ideal gas, the temperature dependence of this quantity can be calculated with Sutherland's formula, and it usually appears along with the length and a factor of 8 in the denominator of Poiseuille's equation.  Often measured with a Zahn cup, its kinematic form is found by dividing its dynamic form by the density.  It is found as the ratio of shear stress to velocity gradient in Newtonian fluids, for which this quantity remains constant. For 10 points, name this fluid property measured in poise, often defined as the resistance of a material to flow.

Latane and Darley were the first to study this phenomenon, and confirmed that as the number of subjects increased, so did the effect's impact.  The most famous example of this phenomenon was the murder of Kitty Genovese, and it can be counteracted by the victim of an attack pointing to a specific individual and asking them directly for help.  For 10 points, name this effect in which a diffusion of responsibility makes people NOT intervene in an emergency situation when many others are present, acting only as the namesake onlookers.

answer: {parallel} postulate [accept {Euclid's fifth postulate} before read]

Arthur Schopenhauer criticized attempted proofs of this statement from concepts rather than using perception, and G.S. Klügel demonstrated how 28 attempted proofs of it were wrong. It can be equated to Proclus' axiom, and a stronger version of it is Playfair's axiom. Described in Proposition 29, it was shown to be independent of four earlier statements of the same kind. Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann have all developed geometries in which it doesn't hold. For 10 points, name this fifth postulate in Euclid's Elements, which deals with lines that never intersect.
