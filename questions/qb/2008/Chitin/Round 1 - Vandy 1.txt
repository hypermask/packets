It can be found in long traveling chains, and the malate-aspartate shuttle is used between it and the cytosol. Its namesake uncoupling occurs in brown fat, and apoptosis is induced when cytochrome c is released from it. Its cristae are formed by its inner membrane, which is evidence of its endosymbiotic origin.

Radiation from this object has recently been used to study the sun's corona and the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan as each transited it.  It is surrounded by a helium-rich torus, and near its center, a shock front is formed by its interaction with the equatorial wind produced by its identically named pulsar. First recorded by Jon Bevis, this object in the constellation Taurus was named from the shape of a drawing of it by the Earl of Rosse.

answer: {Bose}-{Einstein} condensates

Their behavior is described by an equation that adds a coupling constant based on scattering lengths to the Schrödinger equation, known as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. They can implode if their wavefunctions are made to be attractive, and they can spontaneously flow out of containers as well as greatly slow a beam of light. One of their namesakes first proposed the idea but could not get his work published until the other namesake saw it. For 10 points, name this state of matter named for an Indian and a German who also name the statistics that govern their particles.

answer: {Embargo} Act

Albert Gallatin was skeptical of this act from the beginning, saying that “government prohibitions do always more mischief than had been calculated.” A lesser-known element of it was the requirement that ships post a bond equal to the value of the cargo they carried. This law was revealed to be devastating to American shipping, without forcing the expected change in the Orders in Council. It was repealed just days before Thomas Jefferson left office, to be replaced by the equally ineffective Non-Intercourse Act. For 10 points, name this 1807 law which forbid Americans from trading with either France or Great Britain.

answer: {activation} energy

This quantity is the first one examined when using the Hammond postulate.  The negative of this quantity divided by the gas constant is the slope of the line formed in a plot named for the same man who names the equation that calculates this quantity.  That expression is the negative product of the gas constant, temperature, and the natural log of the reaction rate over the pre-exponential factor, and is named for Arrhenius. Catalysts increase the reaction rate by lowering this quantity.  For 10 points, name this quantity, the minimum amount of energy needed for a reaction to occur.

It opens at a New Year's festival where the second title figure offers the chance to strike him if the favor can be returned a year later.  It turns out the stranger is Lord Bertilak, and the ploy had been engineered by Morgan Le Fay to test the youngest of the round table knights.

answer: {Laffer} curve

Its name was coined by Wall Street Journal editor Jude Wanniski in 1978, and it is a major foundational basis for an economic theory decried as “Voodoo” by George H.W. Bush.  It holds that at both 0% and 100% levels of its primary object, the government actually gains no revenue.  As a result, proponents of this curve argue that in many cases, cutting taxes will actually result in more profits for the government.  For 10 points, which economic curve, famously first drawn by its popularizer on a cocktail napkin, was crucial for Ronald Reagan's supply-side economic policy?

One success of string theory, in which these are closed strings able to move between branes, is the fact that it resolves infinities that arise when combining these with the Standard Model at high energies.  With current technology, these cannot be directly observed, though the LIGO and VIRGO experiments are presently trying to observe their associated waves.  For 10 points, name this hypothetical particle with spin two, the carrier of the weakest of the four fundamental forces, gravity.

answer: Captain {Ahab}

One character takes notice of this man's biblical namesake when he points out that dogs licked up the blood of that namesake. Although he is a Quaker, he is driven to revenge, which ends when he yells “From hell's heart I stab at thee.” His real-life counterpart is George Pollard, Jr., who was in charge of the Essex until its sinking, but probably lacked the obsessiveness of this character, which led to the death of all the sailors except for Ishmael. For 10 points, name this tragic hero and captain of the Pequod in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick.
