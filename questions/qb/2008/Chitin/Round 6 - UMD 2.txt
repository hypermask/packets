answer: {Hydrogen} Bonds

A capital letter is used to denote these stabilizing agents in the Zimm-Bragg model, and high-pressure formic acid has exhibited their symmetric variety. The presence of these entities in the coiled coil of the quaternary structure of collagen gives the protein its tensile strength. Occasionally appearing in bifurcated form, they are used in “smart rubber” and usually occur with Fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen and their namesake. Weaker than covalent forces, these dipole-dipole bonds often cause materials to have high boiling points. For 10 points, identify these bonds, famously present in water and named for the lightest element.

answer: {Searching} Algorithms (also accept things like {Lookup Algorithms}; prompt on "{Query}" since that's a related but different operation)

Grover's Algorithm provides a mechanism for doing this operation in Big O of squareroot of n time on a quantum computer.  One way to optimize this operation is with a genetic algorithm and a well built hash table can perform this operation in constant time.  A binary type of this operation can produce an output in Big O of log n time on a sorted list by always picking the middle element of a sublist.  In graph theory, this can be done in a breadth first or depth first fashion.  For 10 points, identify this type of algorithm that, unsurprisingly, finds an element in a data structure.

answer: {B3} (accept {Nicotinic Acid} before “nicotine” and “{Niacin}” before mentioned)

This molecule can be used to reduce LDL levels since it prevents fat breakdown in adipose tissue, while in large quantities it can cause a namesake thickening of the macula. Governed by G-protein HM74A, it forms when a carbonyl group attaches at the 3 position to pyridine, and along with its precursor and aspartic acid, it is used to synthesize NADH. The preparation of corn with alkali lime is used to prevent the horrible lesions and dementia associated with pellagra, resulting from a deficiency in this vitamin. Synthesized from tryptophan and first discovered in nicotine, FTP, identify this B vitamin, also called Niacin.
