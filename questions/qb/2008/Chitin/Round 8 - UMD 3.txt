answer: Triton

High plains on this planet are dotted with pits like the Leviathan Patera, indicating huge flows of possibly ammonia-based lava.  This topography, combined with geologic diapir activity, casues the “canteloupe” appearance of this body, which may actually have atmospheric winds as evidence by the streaked pattern of geyser residue.  It cannot have arisen out of the same solar nebula that yielded the body it orbits, evidence by its retrograde rotation, leading most astronomers to conclude that this moon is a capture Kuiper Belt object.  Cryovolcanism runs rampant on, for 10 points each, what coldest body in the solar system, the largest moon of Neptune?

answer: Angular {Momentum}

Different values of this quantity for a nucleus at minimal energy is used to find the Yrast.  When coupling of this quantity occurs, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are produced.  One property of this gives rise to Kepler's Second Law, also known as the law of equal areas, and that same property of this quantity about the z axis is explained in Noether's Theorem.  One definition of this quantity is the product of the moment of inertia with the angular velocity, while it is also equal to r cross p.  It explains why a spinning gyroscope does not fall over.  For 10 points each, identify this conserved quantity, often symbolized L.

When properly optimized, the Sieve of Atkins is a modern method for finding them that is faster than the ancient Sieve of Eratosthenes. There are infinitely many of them, and the Riemann hypothesis and Goldbach conjecture speculate on their distribution and the expression on integers as pairs of them, respectively. Really large ones factor into the RSA encryption method commonly used for secure internet transactions while special ones identified by Mersenne are equal to one less than 2 raised to certain powers. 2 is the only even example of, for 10 points each, what numbers whose factors consist only of 1 and themselves?
