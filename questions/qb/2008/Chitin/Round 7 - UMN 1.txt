Deriving this value from the second law of thermodynamics yields the value d-E over d-S, where E is energy and S is entropy.  According to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the value for this property in an ideal gas equals two-thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas over k, the number of moles times the ideal gas constant.  The zeroeth law of thermodynamics involves three reservoirs with the same value for this property, and it appears along with number of moles and the gas constant on one side of the ideal gas equation.
