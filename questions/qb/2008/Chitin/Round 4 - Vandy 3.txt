answer: calcium

In nature, this element is prevalent in gypsum and dolomite, as well as a namesake birefringent mineral that marks the 3 on Mohs hardness scale. Its presence in biological cells can lead to the formation of inositol tri-phosphate and di-acyl-glycerol, and its influx into axons causes release of neuro-transmitters. It is stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells, where it aids contraction by binding to troponin. For 10 points, name this element that needs vitamin D to be absorbed, which joins with phosphate to form the mineral basis of bone and is symbolized Ca.
