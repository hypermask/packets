answer: {irrational} numbers

Beatty's Theorem applies to a pair of numbers of this type. They form a set of measure one in the interval (0,1), and their indicator function can therefore be Lebesgue integrated, but not Riemann integrated over this interval, as illustrated by a function which is continuous only on these named for Dirichlet. They can be generated from another set of numbers by employing Dedekind cuts. The square root of any integer that is not a perfect square is, FTP, one of what class of real numbers that cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers, such as pi and e?

answer: {resistance}

s-d interactions cause this property in transition metals, while in simple metals, it results from phonon interactions. With alternating current, the skin effect and proximity effect contribute to it. It is usually directly proportional to length and inversely to cross-section, and in metals it is directly proportional to temperature, but in a semiconductor, this quantity decreases exponentially with temperature. It is impossible to find equivalent values of it across a circuit containing a Wheatstone bridge. FTP, name this quantity calculated in Ohm's law by the ratio of voltage to current.

answer: enthalpy

It is held constant in throttling processes, and the Born-Haber process measures one of these associated with a crystal lattice. It is commonly written as the sum of the system's internal energy with the product of its pressure and volume, and for constant-pressure processes, the change in this quantity may be written as work. The summed change in this quantity for individual steps of a reaction equals the overall change in this quantity according to Hess's law. FTP, identify this thermodynamic state function sometimes referred to as the heat content of a system.
