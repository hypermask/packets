answer: {polarity} (accept word forms {such} as {polar})

The protein clathrin regulates this property in cells, and molecules that partially have this property may form micelles. Surfactants exploit it to promote emulsions, and soaps and detergents take advantage of it to carry away otherwise insoluble dirt. Although important when forming bonds, it may also be calculated as a net quantity across a molecule by taking the sum of the molecule's dipoles. Resulting in partial positive and negative charges, this is, FTP, what term denoting the uneven distribution of charge across a molecule, as with water but not oxygen gas?

A linear transformation has this property if it preserves the inner product, and the functions sine and cosine have this property with respect to the Lesbesgue measure. This type of matrix is a unitary matrix with all entries real, and the Gram-Schmidt process can take a set of vectors and produce another set that is both this and normal, a special kind of basis. This is also the relationship between two vectors with a dot product of zero and two lines whose slopes are negative reciprocals. FTP, identify this property possessed by the diagonals of a rhombus and the sides of a square.

answer: immune tolerance

Its central type typically requires apoptosis, while the transcription of relevant proteins in the thymus is initiated by AIRE. TCR-alpha and light chain receptor editing happens in some cases; in others, naïve cells in the absence of costimulation merely display anergy. In the absence of its acquired form, transplant rejection may occur; its induced form is used to treat allergies so the immune system will stop responding to the presence of an antigen. FTP, identify this characteristic that can be built up over time by someone who frequently consumes drugs, poison, or alcohol.

answer: nuclear {fission} 

The four factor formula is used to gauge the sustainability of this process in an infinite medium, and this process occurred underground at Oklo, Gabon, around two billion years ago. In that case, water seeping through the ore slowed down neutrons, making them more likely to be absorbed, but now beryllium is often used as a neutron reflector in order to lower the necessary supercritical mass. For 10 points, name this physical process where the nucleus of a large atom is split into two pieces by a neutron, releasing more neutrons and sometimes causing a chain reaction.
