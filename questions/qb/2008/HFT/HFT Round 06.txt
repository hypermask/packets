answer: {solvent}

Deep eutectic ones incorporate quaternary ammonium salts, while a theta one allows polymers to behave as ideal chains. Systems of several of them assume properties most similar to their more polar component, so common combinations include nine parts hexanes to one part ethyl acetate. Many organic reactions are accelerated by the use of polar aprotic ones, and the properties of these partially control the nature of colligative properties. When water acts as one of these, reagents are called “aqueous.” FTP, identify these substances paired with solute in a solution.

answer: {thymine} (accept {vitamin B1} before it is mentioned)

Structurally, this compound contains a pyrimidine ring and a thiazole ring, so sulfate preservatives usually break it down. Dietary deficiency in this compound can result in Wernicke's encephalopathy and another disorder with two forms, one of which is sometimes called endemic neuritis and weakens capillary walls, while the other causes nerve damage and partial paralysis. Clinically detected by the level of transketolase activity in red blood cells, this compound prevents both the wet and dry forms of beriberi. FTP, name this essential vitamin also called B1.

answer: monopoly

Hotelling's law used the example of ice cream stands on a beach to demonstrate that this situation can be advantageous to consumers, and total price discrimination can lead to this situation being Pareto optimal. A natural one involves decreasing marginal costs, often referred to as economies of scale, and this situation generally leads to deadweight loss and inefficiency because the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve. Such a firm has price-setting power and extracts positive profits because there are no close substitutes to its good. FTP, identify this economic situation in which a good is sold by only one firm.

answer: {Rosie} the Riveter

answer: friction

The Hubble type is a result inherent to the expansion of the universe, while velocity-dependent forms of this force cause harmonic oscillators to be called “damped” and are commonly proportional to speed squared at high speeds and for thin fluids. One such form is responsible for objects having a terminal velocity they cannot exceed. Typically dissipating energy as heat, it is most commonly divided into static and kinetic forms, both of which are proportional to the magnitude of the normal force. FTP, identify this force which opposes the motion of an object.
