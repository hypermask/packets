answer: {weak} (nuclear) force (accept {weak} interactions)

Feynman and Gell-Mann proposed a V minus A Lagrangian for it to account for one of the ramifications of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. Its short range of influence, smaller than an atomic nucleus, is caused by its massive gauge bosons. Some interactions of it can result in a change of flavor, and they violate parity symmetry because it affects only left-handed particles. In addition, it is the only fundamental force that affects neutrinos. FTP, identify this force responsible for beta decay, which is carried by the W-plus, W-minus, and Z-zero bosons.

answer: polynomials

In algebraic geometry, an affine variety is the set of solutions to a system of equations of this type, and modding out by an irreducible one of these always gives a field.

Olefin metathesis incorporates one of these named for Grubbs, and a heterogeneous one, often palladium, figures in the hydrogenation of double bonds. It is the role played by iron in the Haber process, and reagents that cannot function as these are added in stoichiometric quantities. They achieve their principal effect by introducing an additional intermediate and hence an additional transition state. They are regenerated after a reaction is complete, and organic examples of them are called enzymes. FTP, identify these substances that lower the activation energy of a chemical reaction to increase its rate.
