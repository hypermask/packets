answer: {amino} acids

They may be linked in a reaction that uses protecting groups like the acetal TBS and the carbamate Boc to carry out a specific DCC coupling. They can be produced by a reaction that forms and then hydrolyzes a nitrile using potassium cyanide and ammonia, which is named for Adolph Strecker. An uncommon one uses selenium in the place of sulfur, while another is most often found in beta sheets, since its cyclic sidechain allows for sharp turns. FTP, identify these products of the process of translation, which are the monomers of proteins.

answer: {Bernoulli's} principle

It may be reformulated to suggest that the piezometric head is equal to the opposite of the velocity head plus a constant, which is in turn equal to a term for elevation and one for pressure. Resulting in the Venturi effect, its basic form applies when the divergence of velocity is zero, a condition called isochoric. It states that the sum of pressure with specific kinetic and potential energy is constant, meaning fast-moving fluids exert less force in directions perpendicular to their flow. FTP, identify this effect partly responsible for lift generated by airfoils.

answer: chromatography

Chitin may be used for one form of this, and another, when followed by a transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride and mass spectrometry, is referred to as far-Eastern blotting. The fast protein form often relies on histidine tags, and the size exclusion type is often used to calculate the polydispersity of a synthesized polymer. Another kind uses either packed or capillary columns for a stationary phase, through which a gaseous analyte flows. FTP, name this analytical technique whose best-known variety is the paper form often used to separate the pigments of a pen's ink.
