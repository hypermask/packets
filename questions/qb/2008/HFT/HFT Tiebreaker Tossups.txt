answer: “The Dover {Bitch}”

 The persona believes we should not judge her by how she said "one or two unprintable things" because she "always treats him right."  She is frustrated that she has come "all the way down from London" just to be treated as a sort of "cosmic last resort."  The titular subject of this poem "had read Sophocles in fairly good translation," and she stands on the cliffs of England with a dead poet, presumably looking the Sea of Faith.  FTP, identify this poem by Anthony Hecht, written in response to gender roles in Matthew Arnold's Dover Beach.

answer: centrioles

One study on clam oocytes speculated that one structure that contains them might have its own RNA genome.  The protein ninein (ny-NAY-in) and two of them make up a cell-cycle regulating structure.  Centrin and tektin help to form the characteristic pattern of their walls, which in Drosophila embryos consist of doublets, rather than triplets, of microtubles.  FTP, identify these structures whose astral fibers comprise the mitotic spindle, which in anaphase anchor chromosomes to either side of a cell.
