answer: {Henderson}-{Hasselbalch} equation

It is replaced under certain conditions by a function calculated by combining the chemical activity with the dissociation of another compound, originally anilines substituted with electron-withdrawing groups. While the Hammett function is only applicable in extreme conditions, this equation also neglects the disproportionation of water, being just the logarithm of the expression for the equilibrium constant. Commonly applied to find the isoelectric point of a protein or of a buffer solution, FTP, identify this equation, which gives the degree to which a compound will deprotonate given its pKa and the ambient pH.

answer: Beethoven's {Symphony No. 5} in C minor

Its third movement's cello theme was inspired by Mozart's Symphony No. 40 and is later echoed loudly by horns.  Its slow second movement contains triplet arpeggios in the violas as clarinets and bassoons provide harmony.  Its final movement's development is interrupted by the theme from the scherzo, and its extremely long coda ends in a presto tempo with 29 bars of fortissimo chords.  It is written in a key its composer considered “stormy and heroic,” C minor, and the rhythm of the “fate motif” appears several times throughout it.  Known for that “short-short-short-long” opening motif, FTP, name this symphony completed in 1808 by Ludwig van Beethoven.

It is generated by the 14-demethylation of lanosterol, but its synthesis begins by proceeding through the mevalonate pathway, and squalene is one of its close precursors, like all steroids. It prevents the cell membrane from becoming too fluid at high temperatures while maintaining some fluidity at low temperatures, but it is best known for the associated molecules that transport it, lipoproteins. FTP, name this molecule transported by HDL and LDL, which can, according to the lipid hypothesis, damage heart health.

answer: {Thales} of Miletus

This engineer may have devised a technique to divert the Halys River for Croesus of Lydia, and, according to Callimachus, he taught how to navigate by both Ursa Major and Minor. Like Pythagoras, he learned geometry from the Egyptians, and he discovered that a circle is bisected by its diameter, but he is more famous for his work in cosmology, since he was supposedly the first theorize that reality derives from an “arche,” or “principal substance,” which he thought was moisture or water.

answer: {Nash equilibrium}

They are absorbing states for learning via fictitious play, but Shapley showed in 1964 that convergence to these does not always occur. Dynamic programming and self-generation techniques were used by Fudenberg, Maskin, and Levine to establish the existence of its public perfect refinement when players only use publicly available historical information. While it is the best result that can be supported in one-shot games, the folk theorem implies that it can be improved for repeated games. FTP, name this game theoretical situation in which when all players are best-responding to their opponents' play.

Admiral Saumarez hoped to undermine it by issuing licenses to Norway-bound Danish ships, and its hoped-for effects were mitigated when King John VI fled to Brazil. Based on principles set forth in the Berlin Decree accusing a certain country of violating international law, it was expanded in the Milan Decree and Treaty of Tilsit, where Russia agreed to join it. Starting in 1806, it was the result of France's failure to defeat the Royal Navy at Trafalgar.

answer: {Newton's} law of {cooling}

Its constant of proportionality is proportional to the Nusselt number, and it may be simplified further when the Biot number is less than zero point one. It is replaced by Fourier's law when only a solid or a system of solids is being considered, since this law considers fluid pressure and velocity in addition to thermal conductivity. Adaptable to free flow by raising the right hand side to five fourths or four thirds, FTP, identify this differential equation that suggests in processes like forced convection, the rate of temperature change for a body is proportional to the temperature difference between it and its environment.
