answer: {Livy} (or {Titus Livius})

Scholars argued over whether this man read Pictor and Piso as well as later Annalists, and Asinius Pollio criticized this man for patavinitas, or “rusticness.” His work helped Flavius Josephus write The Jewish War, and he differed with Polybius on whether Hannibal could see Italy from the pass. Much of his lost work was summarized in the Periochae, and his 35 extant books cover the early republic and the Second Punic War. FTP, identify this Golden Age author of Ab Urbe Condita, a 142-volume chronicle “from the founding of the city” of Rome.

answer: {Poincaré} conjecture

Its generalized version can in general be realized as a result of the h-cobordism theorem, but, as Milnor's exotic sphere demonstrates, it only applies to piecewise linear and topological manifolds in these cases. For three-manifolds, the proof follows from the categorization given by Thurston geometrization. This proof was recently finished when the finite time extinction of the Ricci flow was established. FTP, name this recently resolved problem in mathematics which states that every simply connected three-manifold is a sphere.

answer: malaria

The lack of Duffy antigens confers immunity to the vivax species of this disease. This disease can lead to intracranial pressure that often causes abnormal posturing; in severe cases, kidney failure can leak hemoglobin into the urine. Hypnozoites can overwinter, in some cases, remaining dormant in infected liver cells, though generally an infection moves quickly to erythrocytes. Individuals heterozygous for sickle-cell anemia are resistant to, FTP, this disease caused by four species of Plasmodium, spread by the Anopheles mosquito.

answer: George F. {Kennan} (prompt on {Mr. X})

Nikolai Novikov wrote a response to this man's greatest work, which he himself noted was, at 8,000 words, an “outrageous encumberment” on its medium. Serving under Averill Herriman, he took a one-letter pseudonym when he wrote that a certain country acted out of xenophobia and paranoia and would not be amenable to compromise because of a political system perpetually at war with democracy but out of touch with reality. FTP, identify this Deputy Chief of Mission to the U.S.S.R. who inspired the policy of containment with his 1946 “Long Telegram.”

answer: Raven

This figure plays a key role in the Haida creation myth, in which he frees men from a clam shell.  Also known as He'maskas, Txamsem, Yehl, and Kwekwaxa'we, he brought the first berries and meat to humans, not to mention fresh water, fire, and stars.  In Celtic mythology, this figure's form was assumed by Badb and the Morrigan.  FTP, identify this Native American antagonist to Coyote, a trickster who took the Sun in his beak from Gray Eagle's tent, and who shares his name with the forms of Huginn and Muninn, who perch on Odin's shoulders, a pair of birds.

answer: Nicolas {Poussin}

This artist of Tancred and Erminia spent most of his career in Rome, where he roomed with Simon Vouet. Although he painted some religious scenes, such as a series of the Seven Sacraments, most of his works are of ancient myths, such as The Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite and The Birth of Bacchus. His style would later influence Benjamin West and Jacques-Louis David. One of his most famous paintings shows Romulus overlooking a crowded square in which women are being abducted, while classicized shepherds in a semi-wooded landscape read an inscription on a tomb in his Et in Arcadia Ego. FTP, name this French classical painter of The Rape of the Sabine Women.

answer: {Z0} boson

Experimentally, this particle may be used to calibrate the Tevatron to the detection of hadron jets, since unlike the other three particles that can decay into hadron jets, it is discernible from the background and has a precisely known mass. This particle can decay into any fermion and its antiparticle except a top quark, which is too heavy; it is, however, heavier than an iron atom. Any lepton or quark can emit or absorb one, unlike its counterparts, whose interactions are governed by the CKM matrix. The interactions that it mediates never change flavor or any sort of charge. FTP, identify this neutral carrier of the weak nuclear force, often considered with the W+ and W—.

Their energies may be modeled using Marcus theory, and methods for their computation search the PES using techniques like “nudged elastic band” or the “dimer method,” trying to find saddle points on the potential. They resemble the higher-enthalpy species according to the Hammond postulate. FTP, identify these local maxima on reaction coordinate diagrams, whose energy is lowered by the action of catalysts, the point in a chemical reaction where all reacting bonds are half-formed.

answer: Salzburg

Adolf Hitler used to vacation 30km south of this city at the Berghof, but modern visitors here are best entertained by its Mirabell Palace, which boasts trick fountains that squirt tourists. This city is also home to the rococo Leopoldskron Palace near the Untersberg. It was ceded to Bavaria along with the Tyrol by the Treaty of Schönbrunn, while the Anschluss forced the Von Trapp family to flee this city named for its reserves of salt. Best known as the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, this is, FTP, what second most populous city in Austria?

answer: Fanfare for the {Common Man}

Eugene Goossens [GO-since], who commissioned this work, suggested that it be titled some branch of the military, and its composer had considered naming it after the Four Freedoms. Its main theme, later borrowed for the composer's Third Symphony, first appears in the trumpets, which are then joined by the French horns playing parallel fourths and fifths beneath them. That theme consists almost entirely of leaps and is usually punctuated with the percussive motif that also opens the piece, a gong crash followed by two beats of the timpani and bass drum. Ending on a swelling D Major chord, FTP, what is this flourish for brass and percussion written in 1942 by Aaron Copland, dedicated to the average citizen?

answer: {planetary} nebulae (accept {nebulae} before “{proto},” prompt on {nebulae} after “{proto}”)

The layers of the Little Ghost, one of these, are red furthest from the center. The Rotten Egg is a proto-one, and exhibits the bipolar structure typical of others like the Butterfly. One found in Draco is called the Cat's Eye and has a concentric shell structure, suggesting it was formed by a series of regular events. Magnetic fields lead to filamentation in them, and matter bounded ones are fully plasma, while UV bounded ones possess an ionization front. FTP, identify this class of nebulae, all of which have a star in their center, composed of the hydrogen and helium ejected outer layers of red giants.

answer: {hearsay} evidence

Crawford v. Washington expanded the prohibition against this concept when it conflicts with the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Ohio v. Roberts included “indicia of reliability” in a two-pronged test for it, and Davis v. Washington ruled that 911 calls are exempt. Present sense impressions about a condition, excited utterances at a startling event, and last words are exceptions to its eponymous rule. FTP, identify this type of evidence not generally allowed in common-law courts in which one person testifies about what someone else has said.
