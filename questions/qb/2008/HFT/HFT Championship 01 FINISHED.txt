answer: Euler {totient} function (or Euler {phi} function)

The Dirichlet series with the values of this function as coefficients evaluates to zeta of s minus one over zeta of s, while summing it over the divisors of any integer gives the integer itself. The sum of it and the sum of the divisors of an integer n is equal to 2n if and only if n is prime, and it is multiplicative for relatively prime integers. It is the order of the group of units of Z mod Z n, meaning that any unit taken to this power is one, as implied by Euler's theorem. FTP, name this arithmetic function first defined by Euler, which for an integer n is the number of integers less than n that are coprime to n.

answer: {Minkowski} space

Its symmetry group is a ten-dimensional noncompact Lie [LEE] group called the Poincare group. The triangle inequality is reversed when operating on it, since if you consider it as a vector space, its inner product is not positive-definite. Instead, it has a signature with one unit vector of different sign from the others, meaning that any orthonormal basis of this space has one vector of different sign, and that vector is called the timelike component. Vectors are analogously called lightlike if their inner product with themselves is zero. FTP, identify this four-dimensional manifold named for a German mathematician, the setting for Einstein's theory of special relativity.

answer: {Friedel}-{Crafts} acylation

The Vilsmeier reaction achieves the same effect as this reaction by proceeding through an iminium intermediate. It is replaced by the Gatterman-Koch reaction with carbon monoxide, and a two-step process beginning with it replaces a related reaction that, unless the starting material is tertiary, will lead to rearrangement. Moreover, that related reaction generates a more reactive product, leading to polyalkylation, so instead this reaction is followed by Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction. FTP, identify this reaction, catalyzed by Lewis acids like aluminum trichloride, a substitution reaction that links a terminal carbonyl compound to a benzene ring.
