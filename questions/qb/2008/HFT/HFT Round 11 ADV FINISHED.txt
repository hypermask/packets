answer: {Manichaeism}

In this religion's cosmogony, the Primordial Man is raised to the Paradise of lights and Adam and Eve are engendered by two captive particles of light. The two major sects of this religion were the Elect, successors of the founder, and the Hearers. Its followers believe prophets like Buddha and Jesus were sent to the earth by the Father of Lights. Many works in the Persian and Uyghur empires were written in this faith's namesake script. In his Confessions, St. Augustine recounts nine years when he was adhered to this dualistic faith. FTP, name this Gnostic religion developed Sassanid Persia in the 3rd century A.D., which was based on the writings of the prophet Mani.

answer: convex

For closed sets of this type in the plane, also known as ovals, Helly's Theorem shows that, if any three have non-empty intersection, they all have non-empty intersection. The supporting hyperplane theorem shows that any set of this type can be realized as the intersection of closed hyperplanes. Karamata's inequality and Jensen's inequality apply to functions of this type, and any local minimum of such a function must also be a global minimum. FTP, name this mathematical property that for sets means that any line connecting two points in such a set is also contained in the set, a word that often describes a sphere.

This action was proposed by a Jack Benny lookalike and resulted in embarrassment for the “California Kid,” who did not complete it.

answer: Simone de {Beauvoir}

In the 1970s, this author published the essay The Coming of Age, which examined the philosophical problems confronted by the elderly, and a collection of five short stories, When Things of the Spirit Come First. Her most famous work uses biology, psychoanalysis, and history in its “Facts and Myths” section to explain how the title group was othered and objectified. One of her books describes intellectuals such as Anne Dubreuilh and Arthur Koestler, but she is best known for a work which critiques the definition of her gender as an aberration. An editor of Les Temps Modernes and a lover of Sartre, this is, FTP, what French feminist author of The Second Sex?

answer: {aphasia} (or {aphemia})

Landau-Kleffner syndrome is one of these commonly misdiagnosed as autism. Another form of this condition results from damage to a region of the superior temporal gyrus called Brodmann area twenty-two; that type, named for Wernicke, is characterized by word salad, in contrast to a type named for Broca. Strong evidence for brain modularity is represented by the existence of multiple types, as some are marked by dysprosody, telegraphic speech, and agrammatism, while others reflect problems with comprehension. FTP, name this term referring to a diminished ability to comprehend or produce language.

The first stanza of this poem describes walls and towers which surround “gardens bright with sinuous rills”, and the third stanza features an “Abyssinian maid” playing the dulcimer for the narrator, who hopes others will cry “Beware! His flashing eyes, his floating hair!” The poem mentions “caves of ice” where the title character hears “ancestral voices prophesying war” amidst the echoes of “Alph, the sacred river.” which empties into “caverns measureless to man, down to a sunless sea.” For 10 points, name this Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem about the title character's “stately pleasure-dome” in Xanadu.

answer: {Millikan oil drop} experiment

This experiment explored a quantity that may be obtained from the isospin plus half the strangeness plus half the baryon number. The friction from spraying from a rubber bulb, through the triboelectric effect, or else the direct use of an x-ray tube, allowed the experimenter to cause motion to reverse after the eponymous entities reached terminal velocity. The buoyant force in this setup is proportional to velocity with coefficient 6 pi nu a. It was an error in nu, the viscosity of the air, that put the original trial two percent off the true value, corrected only by x-ray diffraction studies. Whether employing glycerine or even mercury, this experiment always generates integer multiples of the same value. FTP, identify this experiment which suspended the namesake entities in an electric field in order to measure  the charge of the electron.

Its panel of the Just Judges was stolen in 1934, and, on the outside, the donors Jodocus Vijd and Lysbette Borluut appear along with grisaille depictions of Sts. John the Baptist and John the Evangelist. Between them and the prophets and sibyls in the top register is an Annunciation in which the shadow of the frame is visible. Also in grisaille are the Sacrifice and Murder of Abel on the interior atop nude depictions of Adam and Eve, which frame two angelic choirs and a deesis group. In its bottom register, hermits, pilgrims, martyrs, and prophets approach the Fountain of the Water of Life and the Lamb of God.

answer: {chelation} (or {chelates}; accept {chelation}-{control} after “{stereoselectivity}”)

The streptomyces bacterium produces an antibiotic that can be deactivated by this process; that molecule, tetracycline, cannot be taken with milk or indigestion remedies containing zinc. In organic chemistry, stereoselectivity can be induced by the use of this process, particularly in the presence of esters and amides, a technique called this control. Virtually all biological molecules can do this, but some have specificity for a certain ion, like the porphyrin rings in hemoglobin, which do this to iron. FTP, name this term for the binding of several ligands to one metal ion.

answer: {Bradley} effect (accept {Wilder effect})

A study by Daniel Hopkins placed the year of its disappearance at 1996, but Blair Levin wrote an op-ed to claim that it never actually existed and a study by the University of Washington claimed that this year saw it in reverse. It was named for the foe of George Deukmejian, it also affected Harvey Gantt, Harold Washington, and Jesse Jackson. A 1988 study found that it depends on the race of the questioner, and some thought it could explain inaccurate numbers from ARG and Zogby in the 2008 New Hampshire primary. FTP, identify this “effect” in which fears about the social acceptability of prejudice lead white voters to tell pollsters they support a black candidate.
