answer: {Jay's} Treaty (prompt on {Treaty} of {London})

Its Southern critics objected that it did not arrange compensation for lost slaves, but Thomas Jefferson was most concerned that it augured an alliance.

FTP, name this 1794 treaty between the United States and Britain negotiated by a Supreme Court justice.

answer: {resistivity}

Electron-phonon interactions cause this quantity to increase with temperature roughly linearly in most metals and to decrease exponentially in semiconductors. It is the ratio between the electric field and the current density when the material in question is isotropic, and the ideal approximation assumes that this quantity is zero. A related quantity is calculated by its product with length over cross-section. FTP, name this electromagnetic quantity, a measure of how strongly an arbitrary quantity of a given material opposes current flow.

answer: {Liberty} Leading the People

In the background on the right, a few pale, rectangular buildings are almost obscured by a cloud of dust, and in the center a man on his hands and knees wearing a red bandanna looks imploringly at the title figure. A boy on the right triumphantly dual-wields a pair of pistols, while on the left one man wears a suit and top hat while clutching his rifle, and another man brandishes his cutlass. All three are urged on by a bare-breasted woman holding a bayonet, above whose head the French flag flies. FTP, identify this painting by Eugene Delacroix.

answer: {Gibbs} free energy

For a system with only one type of particle, this quantity is equal to the chemical potential multiplied by the particle number, and in general, it is equal to the maximum amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a system via a completely reversible process. This quantity is minimized when a system reaches equilibrium at constant temperature and pressure. The second law of thermodynamics means that chemical reactions occur spontaneously if and only if this is negative. FTP, name this thermodynamic quantity that is equal to the enthalpy minus the product of the temperature and entropy.

answer: {stoma} (or {stomate}; or {stomata})

Developmentally, they are divided into agenous, mesogenous, and perigenous varieties; in the last of which, as with grasses, they are unrelated to surrounding tissue. In dicots, anisocytic ones are surrounded by three subsidiary cells and they are produced from a sequence of two unequal cell divisions. They move in response to a loss of chloride and potassium after the release of abscisic acid triggered by the roots. Their most famous role involves a mechanism that uses PEP carboxylase, prevents photorespiration, and minimizes water loss, in which they open only at night in CAM plants. FTP, identify these pores used by leaves for gas exchange.

answer: determinant

The number of alternating sign matrices is given by the Hankel type of these for binomial coefficients, while the top exterior algebra gives its value for a general linear transformation. This function of the matrix exponential is equal to the exponential of the trace, and it is the unique alternating multilinear function from the space of square matrices to its underlying field. For two vectors in three-space, it can be used as a mnemonic for the value of the cross product, and it is invariant under elementary row and column operations. FTP, give this function that associates to each square matrix a scalar and which can be computed by cofactor expansion.

answer: {inferiority complex}

This concept motivated the teleological side of its author's model of human motivations. Though out of favor with sociologists, the concept used to be broadly applied, particularly to the British Commonwealth, as “cultural cringe.” As originally defined, one emerged from two separate feelings: a “secondary” compensatory desire for security would inflame a “primary” observation of personal weakness, leading to a vicious cycle common to neuroses. FTP, identify this driving force, a belief in one's insufficiency, that was theorized by Alfred Adler.
