answer: {intrusive} igneous rocks (accept {plutonic} igneous rocks before “{plutons}”)

During their formation, processes like kaolinization and greisen formation take place. For each rock like basalt and rhyolite, this class has a chemically analogous, phaneritic rock like gabbro and granite. The nature of its formation, separated by a contact from the surrounding country rock, allows characteristically slow cooling and therefore large crystals. Forming in plutons such as dikes and sills, this is, FTP, what class of igneous rock that cools, crystallizes, and solidifies below the surface of the earth?

answer: {inverse square} law

For an irrotational field in three-dimensional space, a law of this type implies that the divergence is zero; a specific case of that statement is Gauss's law. The intensity of one of these forces can be correlated to the density of field lines beginning at one body and ending at another or at infinity. Acoustic intensity also obeys this type of law, more famously typified by electric fields by Coulomb's law and by gravitation fields. FTP, identify this type of law that describing fields whose intensity falls off proportionally to a certain power of distance.

answer: {alcohols}

Triphenyl phosphine and DEAD may be used to convert them to esters, while Collins reagent will convert them to aldehydes and ketones. Oxymercuration-demercuration and hydroboration-oxidation are two important methods for their controlled synthesis. Triglycerides have a poly-one as their backbone, linking three fatty acids. One with one carbon, which is highly toxic and causes blindness, is usually added to laboratory stocks of the two-carbon one to discourage ingestion. FTP, identify these compounds with an OH group, which include an isopropyl “rubbing” kind.

One structural classification for these terpenoids divides them into the pregnanes, cholanes (KOH laynz), cholistanes (KOH lih staynz), estranes, and androstanes. One of their precursors is squalene, and the secretion of one type of them results in higher blood pressure and blood sugar because that hormone, cortisol, is a glucocorticoid. One kind increases membrane fluidity at low temperatures and decreases it at high temperatures. They are characterized by four fused rings and include cholesterol. FTP, name this class of compounds that also come in an anabolic variety used during high-intensity workouts.
