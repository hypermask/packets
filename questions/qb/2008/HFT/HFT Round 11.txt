answer: {salts}

Strong ones are odorless and nonvolatile, while weak ones may have a characteristic odor as they slowly hydrolyze. The ability to form an insoluble one drives many double-replacement reactions. There are both acidic and basic varieties, despite their derivation, based on what happens when they are dissolved in water, and in solution, since they can conduct a current, they are electrolytes. By definition, they are the result of neutralization reactions between an acid and a base. FTP, give the chemical term that in common usage might refer to sodium chloride.

answer: {non}-{conservative} forces

Their force fields have nonzero curl because they cannot be represented as the gradient of a scalar field. For the same reason, the path integral of one of these forces around a circle is nonzero. The work they do is equal to the change in mechanical energy. They arise from neglecting some of a system's degrees of freedom by using statistical methods, since a molecular analysis would never find energy to be “lost” as heat. FTP, name these forces, such as drag and friction, that depend on path.

answer: angle {bisector}

The Steiner-Lehmus theorem states that if the lengths of two of these are equal in any triangle, then the triangle is isosceles. They can be easily constructed by connecting a vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the minor arc connecting the other two vertices on the circumcircle. Their namesake theorem relates the ratio in which they cut the opposing side with the ratios of two sides of the triangle. Their external versions intersect at the excenters, while their internal versions intersect at the incenter. FTP, name these lines that divide the corners of a triangle in half.
