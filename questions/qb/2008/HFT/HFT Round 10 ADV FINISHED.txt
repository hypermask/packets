answer: Le {Corbusier} (or {Charles}-{Edouard Jeanneret})

Initially a designer of watches, he trained in La-Chaux-de-Fonds under Charles L'Eplattenier. The Modulor, his ideal system of measurement based on the Golden Section, was used in his design for the Unité d'Habitation in Marseille. Many of his buildings, such as the Carpenter Center at Harvard, had been constructed on pilotis, obvious external pillars that make a building appear to float. He compared the Acropolis to automobiles and ocean liners in his most famous work, in which he declared that houses must be “machines for living.” FTP, name this Swiss-French architect who wrote Towards a New Architecture and designed Notre-Dame du Haut and the Villa Savoye.

answer: {gibberellins} (prompt on {GAs})

These compounds require SLY1 in order to degrade RGL2 proteins, while they rely on DELLA proteins for signaling. Their major precursor is ent-kaurene, and they are all diterpenoids. In cereals, they stimulate the production of alpha amylase, and in dioecious flowers they induce maleness. They affect the mature regions of trees and shrubs and can induce cell division as well as cell elongation. In addition to rejuvenating dwarf plants and delaying leaf aging, they can stimulate seed germination. FTP, identify these plant hormones best known for their use in producing seedless grapes.

answer: Von {Schlieffen} Plan

Yuri Danilov correctly predicted it, but his so-called “Plan 19” to stop it was not fully carried out. It was delayed at Namur and Liège until “Big Bertha” could clear the path, while Alexander Von Kluck's deviation from it gave an opportunity to a Joseph Gallieni's garrison. Its original conception envisioned a march through the Netherlands, but Helmut von Moltke changed it, and it was finally abandoned after Joseph Joffre commandeered taxis to take his men to the Battle of the Marne.

answer: {RR Lyrae} variables

One subclass of these stars, d, consists of double-mode pulsating stars, and that subclass is commonly plotted on Petersen diagrams to analyze the effects of metallicity on their properties. Commonly found in globular clusters, the  luminosities of these Population II stars are typically around forty five solar, and their periods vary from a few hours to two days. Formerly called cluster Cepheids, FTP, identify this class of pulsating horizontal branch stars, named for a star in the Lyre.

answer: {Hall} effect

The Corbino effect is related to this other physical effect, but it describes the flow of charges in a circular disk. This effect can occur in a plasma, but its namesake parameter, the ratio between electron gyrofrequency and collision frequency, can then exceed one. It has spin and quantum varieties, but in its basic form it describes the effects of the Lorentz force acting on charges moving in a magnetic field. FTP, identify this electromagnetic effect, in which a perpendicular current generates a namesake voltage by causing moving charges to accumulate on one side of a conductor.

answer: Charles-Camille {Saint}-{Saëns}

The cello's main motif follows one short chord from the orchestra to begin his unconventional Cello Concerto No. 1. In one of his operas, one title character seductively sings “Ah! Respond to my tenderness” before the other reveals to her the source of his enormous strength, and a two-movement symphony by him features low pedal notes in the featured instrument. In addition to Samson and Delilah and The Organ Symphony, another work by him requires the lead violin to tune its E string down half a step and play col legno to imitate rattling bones, Danse Macabre. FTP, name this French composer of a work including “The Elephant” and “The Swan,” The Carnival of the Animals.

answer: The {Chrysanthemum} and the {Sword:} Patterns of Japanese Culture

This book documents a tradition of pederasty among men in high station, and its author explains how the sword is “a simile of ideal and self-responsible man” when arguing that a “phraseology of virtue” maintains the “inner sword.” This book discusses cigarettes before battle and explains two decades of national phenomena by leveraging giri, practical and immediate obligation, and gimu, hierarchical unquantifiable obligation. This work was criticized for not relying on firsthand experience, but it popularized the contrast between Western “guilt culture” and Eastern “shame culture.” FTP, identify this ethnography of Japan written by the Patterns of Culture author Ruth Benedict.

answer: {amides}

The Bodroux reaction forms them from a Grignard reagent, an aniline derivative, and a carboxylic acid, and the Beckmann rearrangement produces cyclic ones, called lactams, from oximes. Their IR shift is the furthest downfield of any saturated carbonyl, between 1630 and 1695, reflecting the fact that they are the least reactive derivative. a This term is sometimes used to describe deprotonated ammonia, and peptide bonds are also called these linkages. FTP, identify this functional group, which may be described as an amine with an acyl group for one substituent, or as a nitrogen analogue of carboxylic acids.

answer: {linked list}

Some types of hash tables use them to avoid collisions, and major disadvantages include a lack of serializability or caching. Its unrolled version carries an array of several data values within each node to ensure that more contiguous blocks of memory are used. CDR coding is used to implement them in LISP. Iterators are commonly used to read these sequentially, as they do not support fast random access, but insertion and deletion are both supported in constant time. FTP, name this data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing references to the next or previous nodes.
