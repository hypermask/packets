answer: {triple} point

Many of these exist for substances with multiple polymorphs, such as silver iodide and aluminum silicate, and helium-4 has two of them, called “lambda” ones, because of superfluidity. If a substance has n solid phases, it will have n choose three of these. Gibbs's phase rule states that there exist one fewer degrees of freedom under this condition than the number of components in the mixture. One aspect of it for water is the second reference point of the Kelvin scale. FTP, name this pressure and temperature at which one may isolate all of a substance's three phases.

answer: {exponential} function ({accecpt} y = {e} to the {x} after “reals” is read)

It provides a map to any Lie group from its corresponding Lie algebra. Its matrix form may be used to give solutions to systems of linear differential equations, while for the reals it is the unique Lebesgue measurable function f that satisfies f(x+y) = f(x) f(y). Its MacLaurin coefficients are equal to one, and it is the only function that is its own derivative. Euler's identity shows that its value at pi i is negative one, while its inverse is the natural logarithm. FTP, name this function whose value at positive integers is the product of several copies of Euler's constant.

D. Hoyos recently argued that these conflicts were unplanned rather than the result of imperialism or a desire for revenge. The first escalated from a conflict between Hiero II and Mamertines and was followed by the Mercenary War, while the second saw Hasrudubal killed at the Battle of Metaurus River. The third was supported by Cato the Elder and ended with a victory for Scipio Africanus.

answer: {quartz}

A cubic polymorph of this mineral, cristobalite, forms metastable spheres that, when hydrated, form opal. One stone made of this mineral and moganite is monoclinic and has a characteristic waxy luster and is called chalcedony. Another form of this mineral, citrine, is generated upon heating a stone with iron and aluminum impurities that give it a purple color, amethyst. FTP, identify this mineral commonly found along with gold, a silicon dioxide crystal defining Mohs hardness seven and known for its rose and milky varieties.

answer: {phototropism} (accept {heliotropism} before “{light source}”)

The Bunsen-Roscoe law, or reciprocity theorem, explains this effect but cannot explain why both its positive and negative kinds can occur in the same tissue. Null nph1 mutants of Arabidopsis do not display it. Etiolation occurs when this phenomenon cannot operate, resulting in characteristically thin, yellow stems. Certain hormones activate proton pumps on one side of a cell, leading to a pH decrease that weakens the cell wall, and this phenomenon is driven by turgor in that direction. FTP, name this tendency of plants to grow toward or away from a light source.

Marx generators use a large number of these connected in series by spark gap switches to generate a high voltage. One of their components has an electrolytic variety, which soaks that component in liquid electrolyte but is not suitable for high frequency operation. One of these appears with a resistor, a switch, and a DC source in charging circuits.

In addition to “Caliban upon Setebos” and “Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister,” the title character of another poem “warily open[s]” the eyelids of the corpse of the women he had just strangled with her hair, and another of his poems ends by discussing a sculpture of Neptune taming a sea horse.
