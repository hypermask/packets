answer: {L'Hopital's} rule (or {Bernoulli's} rule)

It has a discrete analog in the Stolz-Cesaro theorem, which holds that the limit of the ratio of the difference between consecutive terms of two sequences is equal to the limit of the ratio of the terms. It is usually proved using the extended mean value theorem, and this statement holds only when one of the functions it describes does not change from positive to negative infinitely many times. It fails on the limit of x divided by the square root of x-squared plus one as x goes to infinity. FTP, identify this method that uses derivatives to compute indeterminate limits.

answer: {calorimetry} (accept word forms {such} as {calorimeter})

One type of this process is referred to as “differential scanning [this]” and is commonly used to find a substance's glass transition temperature. A more common type of this technique operates at constant volume with high-pressure pure oxygen and is ignited with an electric charge, which is reflected by a change in the surrounding water. In addition to the “bomb” form, simple ones typically contain a liquid in a good insulator, which is heated by a burning substance. FTP, identify this process of measuring the heat content of a given mass of fuel.

answer: {Drosophila} melanogaster (prompt on {fruit fly} before it is mentioned)

This organism features class II transposons called P elements, which cause a form of temperature-dependent sterility in its offspring called hybrid dysgenesis. Its blastoderm stage is a syncytium, allowing rapid uptake of injected DNA. Its salivary glands have giant polytene chromosomes formed from repeated endoreplication. Common mutations in this organism include antennapedia, though it is most associated with sepia eyes or vestigial wings. The two-week life cycle and sequenced genome make, FTP, what insect also called the fruit fly a great model organism?

answer: {Atwood's machine}

The swinging variety is only integrable when the stationary element is three times as massive; otherwise, the motion it exhibits is chaotic. In the simplest case, the acceleration of the system is equal to g times the difference of the masses over the sum of the masses; similarly, the tension in the string connecting the two masses is equal to g times twice the product of the masses over their sum. Invented by its namesake to prove Newton's laws, this is, FTP, what simple apparatus that consists of two or more masses connected by a massless string on frictionless pulleys?

answer: {subduction}

One paper postulates that this process explains the coronae of Venus, which are thought to arise from mantle plumes. This process typically results in the nearby development of back-arc basins, and it delaminates the lithosphere that enters the asthenosphere. Large igneous provinces, usually made of flood basalt, make one component of this process too buoyant, leading to the creation of fold mountains or volcanic island arcs. Involving at least one oceanic plate, this is, FTP, what process by which one tectonic plate slips under another?
