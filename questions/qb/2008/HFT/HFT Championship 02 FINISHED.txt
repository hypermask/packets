answer: black body

These objects may be described as perfect Lambertians, and one law about these objects predicts the ultraviolet catastrophe. Another law concerning these entities explains the utility of infrared sensors because it predicts that an object's temperature is two point nine millimeters Kelvin divided by the wavelength at which it radiates the most, which can be modeled by a curve named for Planck. Besides the Rayleigh-Jeans law and Wien's law, a better-known equation predicts that the radiant flux of is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. For 10 points, identify these objects that absorb all incident light.

answer: {Burma} Road

It began at Lashio and crossed its only international boundary at Wanting, just 120 miles into its 700-mile course to Kunming. It was linked to Assam after the Ledo Road was constructed under the command of Joseph Stillwell, but when it was first rendered inaccessible, American pilots had to fly supplies over the Himalayas to reach Yunnan. Constructed in 1938, it crossed the Salween and Irrawaddy Rivers and allowed the Allies to transport weapons to Chiang Kai-shek.

answer: {Hamiltonian} mechanics

A "clamped nuclear" one is employed by the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Liouville's theorem demonstrates that it is the Noether charge corresponding to time translation invariance, and in quantum mechanics, it is a Hermitian, and therefore its eigenvectors generate a basis for its Hilbert space. Any smooth real-valued function on a symplectic space defines one, leading to an alternate derivation of the system that uses it, which often employs the Poisson bracket. FTP, identify this quantity, namesake of a reformulation of classical mechanics, which represents a system's total energy and is the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian.

In high dosages, it drives four fifths of prostate cancer cells to apoptosis and can freeze the remaining testosterone-dependent ones in the G0 phase. TRPV1 appears to be this alkaloid's only receptor. It downregulates the production of a certain tachykinin derivative, the neurotransmitter and neuromodulator substance P, whose activation stimulates vomiting and which may be involved in fibromyalgia. Like tarantula venom, it induces inflammation without causing actual chemical burn. FTP, name this substance measured by the Scoville scale, famously produced by many chili peppers.

answer: polymerization

One form of this process was pioneered by Kris Matyjaszewski (mat uh SHEF ski) and uses redox equilibria, commonly between copper (I) and copper (II) bromide, to control its rate. This process is carried out on alpha-olefins using compounds like triethylaluminum, called Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Another is carried out between the “iso” and the “resin blend,” which combines provide isocyanate and hydroxyl which react to form a urethane bond. FTP, identify this process, often carried out with a radical mechanism with initiation, extension, and termination steps, which links monomers into long chains.
