answer: {Kepler's Third} Law [or {harmonic} law]

Newton “corrected” this law by squaring both sides of one form of it, and this law is used to compute the Gaussian gravitational constant. Joseph Privat de Molieres proved one case of it by showing that if the normal force and centripetal force are proportional, then one over r squared is proportional to v squared over r, and since v is proportional to r over t, r cubed is proportional to t squared. For 10 points, name this law, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of that orbit.

answer: {parabola} [or word forms like {parabolic}]

The solution of the Poincaré conjecture via Ricci flow requires a general solution of a partial differential equation of this kind. An aberration known as a coma occurs in reflectors of this shape. The hyperbolic version of its three-dimensional analog is shaped like a saddle, and rolling it along a straight line produces a catenary curve. It is the locus of points equidistant from a focus and directrix, and is produced when a plane intersects a right circular cone. For 10 points, name this conic section with an eccentricity of 1, the shape of curves like y = x2.
