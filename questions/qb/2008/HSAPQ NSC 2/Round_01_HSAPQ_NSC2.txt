answer: index of refraction [or {refractive} index]

When a strong electric field acts on a transparent substance, variation of this quantity gives rise to the Kerr effect, which produces birefringence of a transverse beam of light. When light passes through two materials that share an interface and have different values for this property, Snell's law gives the angles of incidence and refraction. For 10 points, name this quantity that equals the ratio between the velocity of light in a vacuum and the velocity of light in a medium.
