answer: linear {momentum}

In special relativity this quantity's four-vector includes an “energy over the speed of light” term, and the time derivative of its expectation appears in the common form of Ehrenfest's theorem. The fact that this quantity does not commute with position gives rise to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Newton's Second Law gives force as equal to the time derivative of this quantity, and it is conserved in both inelastic and elastic collisions. For 10 points, name this quantity whose change is equal to impulse and which is equal to mass times velocity.

answer: {sulfuric} acid [or {H2SO4}]

This compound used to be manufactured with the use of a nitrogen dioxide catalyst, though a vanadium oxide catalyst is now more common. It can be used as a desiccant, as its reaction with water is highly exothermic and may release enough energy to boil the water.

An irregularity in this object's orbit was noticed by the French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier, who used that fact to predict the existence of one of this object's neighbors. Some scientists believe that this planet was struck by an Earth-sized object early in its history, which could explain why it is tilted 97 degrees and thus is almost completely on its side.
