answer: buoyant force [accept {buoyancy}]

The point where this force intersects the midplane is known as the metacenter, which must lie above the center of gravity for an object in a fluid to be in static equilibrium.

The magnitude of this force can be calculated from the product of gravity, fluid density, and the volume of the submerged object using Archimedes' principle. For 10 points, name this force that is equal to the weight of the fluid an object displaces and allows objects to float on water.
