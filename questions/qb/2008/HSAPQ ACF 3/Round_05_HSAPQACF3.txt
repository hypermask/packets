answer: Edward {Hopper}

This artist painted a house with nine columns from an angle that obscures the bottom with brown- orange metal strips, in a work titled House by the Railroad. A barber pole and a fire hydrant cast long shadows in front of a row of shops in his Early Sunday Morning, and two women sit at a table with a blue bowl and red teapot with a visible sign for (*) the title food of his Chop Suey. This man also advertised five-cent Phillies in a painting of two men and a red-haired woman sitting at a diner. For 10 points, name this painter of Nighthawks.

answer: {faults} [or {faultlines}; prompt on {transverse plate boundaries}]

Lines of springs are characteristic of these objects, and the classic theory of their formation is named after Anderson. One type of these objects is divided into “leaky” and “transpressional” types, and in a “reverse” one, the hade is toward the upthrow side. A “reverse” one is almost always a (*) dip-slip type, since in the strike-slip type the walls move horizontally rather than vertically. For 10 points, name these “cracks” in the Earth's crust where one part of the crust moves against another part, a prominent example of which is the San Andreas.

answer: James Augustine Aloysius {Joyce}

In a play by this man, Bertha turns to Robert Hand after feeling neglected by the writer Richard Rowan. One of his stories focuses on the death of the priest Father Flynn, and another of his stories concerns a party hosted by Julia and Kate Morkan at which Greta reveals her love for the (*) dead Michael Furey. In addition to that story about Gabriel Conroy, he wrote a novel which takes place on June 16, 1904, and follows Leopold Bloom's journey through Dublin. For 10 points, name this author of Exiles, Dubliners, and Ulysses.

answer: Max Karl Ernst Ludwig {Planck}

This scientist lends his name to a theory of dilute colloidal solutions. Vacuum fluctuations at a length scale named for him result in quantum foam. He sought to overcome the deficiencies of the Rayleigh-Jeans law and Wien's law to develop a universal law governing the (*) quantized emission of radiation from a perfect emitter. For 10 points, name this individual who developed a law relating blackbody radiation to temperature, and whose namesake constant, symbolized h, relates the energy of a photon to its frequency.

answer: {Missouri} River

This river passes through Ponca State Park, and it ultimately begins at Brower's Spring. The Pick- Sloan program developed this river, resulting in the creation of Lake Sharpe behind Big Bend Dam, as well as Fort Peck Dam. It forms near Three Forks where the (*) Gallatin, Jefferson, and Madison rivers meet, and its tributaries include the Yellowstone and Platte rivers. It passes by the state capitals of Bismarck and Pierre after beginning in Montana. For 10 points, name this river that flows past St. Louis before entering the Mississippi in its namesake state.

The title character of this novel dreams that his grandfather makes him look inside a calfskin briefcase, revealing a slur-containing note. Dr. Bledsoe expels the protagonist after he shows Mr. Norton the “seamy” campus. The title character imitates Rinehart and fights Ras the (*) Destroyer after he joins the Brotherhood, and he earlier worked at Liberty Paints.

answer: {ideal} gas equation or {law}

Deviations from this equation can be found by plotting the compressibility factor against pressure; the virial expansion is often used to measure those deviations. The Peng-Robinson equation is a good alternative to this equation at low pressures and the Redlich-Kwong equation is a better alternative at high pressures. A more common alternative is an equation that introduces parameters (*) a and b, the van der Waals equation. For 10 points, name this equation of state describing the behavior of a sufficiently dilute gas, which states that PV equals nRT.

answer: {John} the {Baptist} [prompt on {John}]

In the Qur'an, he is referred to as the prophet Yahyá and is imprisoned in the citadel Machaerus prior to his death. An angel strikes Zacharias dumb for doubting that this figure will be born. His condemnation of the marriage between Herodias and her brother-in-law Herod Antipas results in his (*) death at the behest of Herodias' daughter Salome. He subsists off locusts and wild honey, and, in Isaiah, he is described as “a voice that crieth out in the wilderness.” For 10 points, name this son of Elizabeth who blessed Jesus by immersing him in the River Jordan.

answer: personality

One type of this was measured on the "F-scale" in a book which found that "anti-intraception," superstition, and obsession with sex and power comprised its "authoritarian" type. Histrionic, dependent, and schizoid are among the types of disorders that can affect it. Tests which attempt to categorize this include the TAT and the Minnesota-developed (*) MMPI. Another test divides it into sixteen “types” based on such qualities as "judgment" and "introversion." For 10 points, a Myers-Briggs test evaluates what thing, the sum of an individual's behavioral characteristics?
