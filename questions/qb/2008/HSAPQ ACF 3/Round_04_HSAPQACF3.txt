answer: {hydrogen} atom

For species that behave like this system, all atomic orbitals with the same principle quantum number are degenerate. It is the only atomic system for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved exactly, and the Rydberg equation can be used to obtain its (*) Balmer spectral series. When an electron is removed from this atom it can protonate water to yield an acidic species, and this is the only atom for which the Bohr model holds. For 10 points, name this atom consisting of a proton and an electron, the first element on the periodic table.
