answer: The {Anxiety} of {Influence}

The epigraph to this work comes from Wallace Stevens' poem “An Ordinary Evening in New Haven,” and quotes the line “As it is, in the intricate evasions of as.” The author references the essay “Of the Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life” to suggest that he owes more to Nietzsche and Emerson for the formulation of the title concept than to Johnson, Coleridge and W.J. Bate in the chapter titled “Tessera.” This book uses the Covering Cherub to represent the difficulties of maintaining divinity and immortality. The author borrows a concept from Lucretius in order to describe the first of his “Ratios of Reversion,” the Clinamen, also described as Poetic Misprision. Its author calls Satan a modern poet “because he shadows forth gigantically a trouble at the core of Milton and of Pope.” Written by the author of A Map of Misreading, for 10 points, name this landmark critical work about the relationships between poets and their precursors, by Harold Bloom.
