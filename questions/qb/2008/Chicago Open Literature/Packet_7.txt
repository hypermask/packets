He discovers the highwayman is Mrs. Miller's cousin when he arrives in London, where he is nearly executed for stabbing Mr. Fitzpatrick while avoiding the affections of Lady Bellaston. He is also helped by his one-time lover Mrs. Waters, who is briefly thought to be his mother before Squire Allworthy sorts things out. For 10 points, name this foundling created by Henry Fielding.

answer: The {Murder} of {Roger Ackroyd}

This novel's protagonist is chastised by its narrator for his habit of using “derange” to mean “disturb.” One subplot involves the suspicion that Mrs. Ferrars poisoned her husband to marry the title character, while another deals with Flora's ring, discovered on the path behind the house. Its solution relies on the deduction that the victim's voice was being played by a since-removed Dictaphone, and that suspicious stepson Ralph Paton was being hidden away at a local inn by the real killer. Though its protagonist would star in over forty more books, at its start he's already retired to grow marrows in King's Abbot, where he meets Dr. James Sheppard, the man that serves as his new sidekick and chronicler until the twist ending.  For 10 points, in what novel does Hercule Poirot discover that the narrator killed the title character?

Richard Sheridan wrote that he “No fix'd effect, no model leaves behind!” in a funeral poem for this man, who wrote the prologue to Sheridan's The School for Scandal.

This work notes “the pomegranates rise and burst and murmur with the bees” and describes a time “when the forest glows with gold and ashen tints.” The narrator calls “O fringes of a placid mere in Sicily,” and discusses “chilly blue eyes...like a fountain in tears.” Its protagonist talks of “sucking the gleam of grape-flesh” and imagines Venus across the very slopes of Etna after exclaiming “Try, then, to flower again, organ of flights, malign syrinx.” That character also made “the thicket steeped in music” by his “flute's outpourings” and “prised apart the tousled wry kisses the gods had so deftly mingled,” spoiling his desire to ravish two nymphs.
