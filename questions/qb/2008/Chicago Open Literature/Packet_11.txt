answer: {Charles Lamb}

He quotes Marvell's “The Garden” in “Old Benchers of the Inner Temple” and describes Coleridge's 'wit-combats' in “Christ's Hospital Five-and-Thirty Years Ago.” He aided his sister Mary in the compilation of the prose volume Tales from Shakespeare, and another of his essays recollects giving a beggar a plum cake.

answer: {Brekekekex koax koax!} [be generous on the number of syllables in the first word]

In Biographia Literaria, Samuel Coleridge compares the argument over sentimental poetry to the dispute over this phrase. It clashes with “Ualu” and “Quaouauh” after the Fall in Finnegans Wake, while in a Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, it is uttered by the kidnapper of Thumbelina as he escapes. In its original use, its final part is described as “the bass cadenza” and it is said to be beloved by the Lyric Nine and Pan. Despite this, a character who is getting blisters on his ass becomes irritated and sings it so quickly and insistently that the chorus shuts up and lets him continue rowing. For 10 points, Xanthias, Dionysus, and Charon must endure what onomatopoetic refrain of Aristophanes' frogs?
