answer: {Oedipus Rex} [or {Oedipus} the {King} or {Oedipus Tyrranus} or {King Oedipus}]

Max Reinhardt revived interest in this play in 1910, and Jean Cocteau collaborated with Stravinsky to create an operatic version of it. Dodds argued that this work illustrates the “desperate insecurity of the human condition” instead of justifying the gods in an essay titled “on misunderstanding” this play. This play begins with people carrying tree branches wrapped in wool, and ends with the Chorus asserting that “mortal man must always look to his ending.” The protagonist resolves to die on Mount Cithaeron after talking with a shepherd, and accuses Tiresias of plotting against him with Creon. In this play, the protagonist's desire to know the source of a pestilence afflicting his city eventually leads him to gouge out his eyes.

answer: “The {Raven}”

Its narrator thinks the air is “perfumed by an unseen censer / Swung by seraphim,” and later asks if another character will inhabit “the distant Aidenn.” Its narrator then wonders if the title character was sent as “respite and nepenthe,” terming it “Prophet!…thing of evil,” and asking it to return to “Night's Plutonian Shore.” However, it “never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting / on the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door.” For 10 points, name this poem about a creature that quoths “Nevermore.”
