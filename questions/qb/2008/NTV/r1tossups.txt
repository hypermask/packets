(TB) One of the characters quotes from First Peter and spends his free time reading his hand-written Bible. The main character has survived scurvy, which is why he is missing some teeth, and goes to an art- ist to get a number painted on his uniform. Some of the actions described in this novel are collecting fire- wood, waiting for packages, laying brick, bartering for tobacco, marching in and out of the gate, scroung- ing extra portions of soup for lunch and dinner, saving portions of bread, and searches by the prison guards. These all occur in very cold conditions in the Soviet Union following the Second World War. Name this novel by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.

answer: Jean Jacques {Rousseau}

(JG) He invented his own scheme for musical notation and wrote two operas: Les Muses Galantes and Le Devin du Village. He thought highly of Newton and Descartes but reserved his highest praise for Fran- cis Bacon, despite often criticizing scientific advancement. His masterwork on education refuted John Locke's, stating that one form of education should be suitable for everyone. That work, L'Ã‰mile, was the companion to a better-known book of his, which discusses the responsibility an educated man has to soci- ety, and elaborates on the author's views on social order. Name this French philosopher, author of Dis- course on Inequality and The Social Contract.

answer: {hydrogen} bonds (accept other word forms of "bonds", and {require only hydrogen} after *)

(JG) These are responsible for the viscosity of phosphoric acid and the high boiling points of ammonia and hydrofluoric acid, and carbon also experiences this phenomenon with multiple atoms of greater elec- tronegativity. These sometimes come in low-barrier and bifurcated varieties. Exhibition of this property is largely responsible for proteins' secondary and tertiary structures. This interaction applies mostly to fluo- rine and other very electronegative atoms like oxygen and nitrogen. Name this type of bond (*) that gives water many of its special properties like capillary action and surface tension.

answer: {"Boulevard} of {Broken Dreams}"

(JG) Its title comes from Gottfried Helnwein's parody of Edward Hopper's painting Nighthawks, but there are at least half a dozen other songs of the same name. While the song has been dogged by allega- tions of plagiarism, Samuel Bayer's unorthodox music video won six major MTV Music Video awards, and the song won the 2006 Grammy for Record of the Year. Its title also can refer to Sunset Boulevard. Identify this triple-platinum song from Green Day's album American Idiot describing "walking a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known".

answer: vermiform {appendix}

(DR) Problems with this organ are sometimes detected using the psoas [SOH uhs] or obdurator sign. Problems arise when the lumen of this organ is obstructed, which is usually caused by lymphoid hyper- plasia. Its base is found at McBurney's point and connected to the cecum [SEE cuhm]. When there are problems with it, patients typically resist motion and report pain in the abdominal right lower quadrant. Name this organ known to ancient Egyptians as the worm of the intestine, often removed because it is un- necessary.

answer: Le {Sacre du printemps}, ballet in {2} parts for {orchestra} or The {Rite} of {Spring}

(MS) Lawrence Morton's analysis of this work uncovered the unacknowledged influence of Jusz- kiewicz's Melodje ludowe litewskie, while more explicit direction was provided by folklorist Nicholas Roerich. The proper beginning of this work sees crashing, xylophone-tinged accents play over a repeated chopping string bitonal chord in two-four, which is cut off by the same high-register bassoon theme that plays solo at the very start. Its two parts are "Adoration of the Earth" and "The Sacrifice," at the end of which a young woman dances herself to death. Name this work depicting an imaginative reconstruction of a ritual from pagan Russia, a ballet of Igor Stravinsky that touched off a riot at its premiere.

answer: Samuel {Clemens} (accept Mark {Twain} before mentioned)

One of his novels begins each chapter with a quote from a calendar written by the title character. That story takes place at Dawson's Landing and involves the identities of two people who switched places when they were a few months old. Another novel is narrated by a man named Hank Morgan, who is often called "The Boss". Though he is best remembered for his novels, he was a prolific writer of short fiction and semi-autobiographical works. Among these is a story about a rigged wager involving an amphibian. Besides writing, he traveled extensively, and his experiences as a steamboat pilot are frequently reflected in his works, even serving as the basis for his pen name. Name this author of Pudd'nhead Wilson, A Con- necticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn who went by the pen name Mark Twain.

answer: James {Buchanan}, Junior

(TB) He was expelled from Dickinson College, but a family friend intervened, allowing him to reenter and graduate in 1809. He served in Congress, but when he was mentioned as a vice-presidential candi- date, Andrew Jackson appointed him minister to Russia to get him out of the country. He later served as Polk's secretary of state, but against Polk's wishes he pushed for the annexation of Central America and Cuba. When he received attention as a potential presidential candidate, Pierce appointed him minister to Great Britain. Eventually, however, he did become President, though the tone for his term was set when the Dred Scott decision was announced two days after his inauguration. He is the only president not to have married, and is best known for being unable to avoid the Civil War. Name this President elected in 1856.

answer: {windchill} effect (accept {clear knowledge} equivalents for "{effect}")

(RS) This phenomenon was documented by Paul Siple and Charles Passel during World War II. Since this value takes air circulation into account, convection caused by body heat has required modification of the original formula. When this value is low, there is a greater heat transfer from the body to the air. Re- ported as a number, it is generally less than the actual temperature because it does not account for humid- ity. This effect was originally calculated in terms of the time necessary for a container of water to freeze if left outdoors, and its formula takes into account wind speed and current temperature. Identify this meas- ure of what the temperature actually feels like on exposed skin.

answer: {Pericles}

(AS) He said, "What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others." That statement came after the first year of his country's disastrous 27-year con- flict with its neighboring states. At the outset of the war, this statesman and general used defensive walls to keep enemies out, a strategy that backfired in the second year of the war, when dense living conditions allowed a plague to spread and kill him along with one third of the populace. Name this architect of the Delian League, implacable enemy of Sparta, and first citizen of Athens.

answer: linear {momentum}

(DR) Its quantum operator is negative i times h bar gradient. For a photon, this quantity is equal to Planck's constant divided by wavelength, which is the same as energy divided by the speed of light. Its derivative with respect to time is equal to net force, a fact which, when combined with Newton's Third Law, shows why this quantity is conserved. The net change in this quantity for an object equals the total impulse upon it. Identify this quantity whose SI unit is kilogram meters per second.

(CA) Its specifications require that players can run a simple form of Java, and its "Live" ability uses internet connectivity to allow sharing content online. Unlike its competitor, it has three region codes, and support for content protection besides AACS. Introduced around 2006, it can hold 25 gigabytes of data per layer, and won a format war against a competing format after Warner Brothers decided to support this format named after the 405 nanometer laser used to create it. Identify this optical disc and successor to the DVD, which is used by the PlayStation 3.

answer: {contraband}

(TB) The root of this word comes from the Latin for "proclamation", and it may have entered English from Spanish or Italian. Civil War General Benjamin Butler used this word to refer to escaped or captured slaves. In a broader military context, it refers to any good that a neutral party supplies to parties in the conflict. Give this 10-letter word beginning with "c" that generally refers to any material one is not au- thorized to possess.
