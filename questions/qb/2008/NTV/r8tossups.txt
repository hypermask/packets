(JG) It is a "slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men", and Yeats' poem on the subject stated that man created this. Henry Vaughan wrote a dialogue about it, and this was also at the window in "The Highwayman". Tennyson claimed that there was wisdom in it in "In Memoriam A. H. H.", which also claimed that its twin brother was sleep. Another poem by Tennyson depicted six hundred men coming through its jaws and riding into its valley.

answer: Johannes "Honus" {Wagner}

(RS) A statue depicting him stands outside of PNC Park, since he helped propel the Pirates to their first World Series in 1903 but played poorly as they lost to Boston. He helped them win in 1909, however, and retired a few years later with a career batting average of three twenty-seven. Nicknamed "The Flying Dutchman", he is considered by many people to be the greatest shortstop of all time, though he may be better known as the subject of "the Mona Lisa of baseball cards". Conventional wisdom is that he denied tobacco companies the right to use his likeness, as he believed tobacco products were harmful. Name this baseball great included in the first group inducted into the Hall of Fame.

answer: {diabetes} mellitus

(JG) One of its symptoms can be kussmaul [COOS mawl] breathing, which is caused by metabolic aci- dosis. This disease is monitored with an HbA1C, or glycosylated hemoglobin, test. Some cases of it may be caused by Coxsackie B4 virus, which attacks the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. Some doctors claim that it can be treated with gastric bypass surgery, while the more traditional treatment sometimes requires the use of glucagon [GLOO kah gahn] to counteract too much of it. Name this disease typically classified as type one or type two that is treated with insulin.

answer: Battle of {Kursk}

(AS) After setbacks over the winter, the German General Staff focused their attention on a massive sa- lient in Soviet lines, near where Field Marshal Erich Von Mainstein had just had success driving back the Soviets at the Battle of Kharkov. The resulting battle was the largest armored and air confrontation in his- tory, pitting German Tigers and Panthers against Russian T-34s and employing almost two million com- bat troops and five thousand airplanes. The Germans were forced to withdraw, beginning what was to be a long string of defeats extending all the way back to Berlin. Name this battle, which along with Stalin- grad turned the tide decisively on the Eastern Front during World War II.

(JG) Do not give an answer in English. An eruv [AIR oov] can be constructed for purposes related to this, whose desecration is the worst possible crime. Observant individuals refrain from what is called muktzah [MOOK tzah], thirty-nine specified activities, and are called shomer [SHOH mair] this. Songs are sung in the kabbalat [kah buh LAT] service the evening before, including "Yedid Nefesh" [yeh-DEED NEH-fesh] and "L'cha Dodi" [lih-KHAH doh-DEE], which anthropomorphizes it as a bride. It ends with rituals including spices and a candle with several wicks, havdalah [hahv DAH lah], and Yom Kippur [YOHM kee POOR] is a special case of this day. Give the Hebrew name for this holiday that begins at sundown on Friday nights and is celebrated every Saturday, the Jewish sabbath.

answer: {Saskatchewan}

(JG) Its name derives from a Cree word meaning "swift river". Henry Kelsey was among the first Europeans to explore it, in the late 1500s, when in addition to the Cree he made contact with the Chipewyan and Blackfoot tribes along the namesake river. That river flows from west to east across the state after absorbing the Battle and Red Deer Rivers in Alberta. In 1885, the MÃ©ti people here attempted the North West Rebellion against Louis Riel, but were exterminated despite their claims to the land. Twenty years later, this area became a Canadian province, and is considered one of the Prairie Provinces. Its center contains Prince Albert National Park. Name this province west of Manitoba whose capital is Regina and whose biggest city is Saskatoon.

(HT) One of its sections is known as Old Frenchman's Place; that Frenchman is Louis Grenier, who is described in Requiem for a Nun. Another section is the former home of Colonel John Sartoris. It was where Boon Hogganbeck, with the help of Uncle Ike McCaslin, hunted and killed Old Ben. It is also the site of Lena Grove's search for Lucas Burch, the Compson family residence, and the Bundren family's ill- fated attempt to inter Addie. Its name comes from two Chickasaw words meaning "split land". It is loosely based on Lafeyette County, and its largest city is based on Lafeyette's city of Oxford. Name this fictional Mississippi county, the setting for many of William Faulkner's most famous works.

answer: the {Slaughterhouse} cases (before *, accept The {Butchers}' {Benevolent Association} of {New}

(JG) The central issue was whether the creation of a monopoly created servitude and eliminated due process in depriving people of property. This case's decision found that the legislation in question was ir- relevant because its purpose did not fit the case, since the alleged victims were not black. Therefore, the privileges and immunities clause was found to apply only to national citizenship, and so the Fourteenth Amendment had not been violated. Name this 1873 (*) set of Supreme Court cases in which Louisiana's institution of a monopoly on the title entities was upheld.

answer: David {Bowie}

(RS) This man, born David Robert Jones, adopted a different last name when he went solo to avoid being confused with a member of the Monkees. In 1971, he began to develop his "Ziggy Stardust" alter ego, though he abandoned it after just two years. Recently, he voiced Lord Royal Highness on Atlantis Squarepantis. In 1983, he signed one of the most lucrative recording contracts in history and recorded the "Let's Dance" album, which featured three Top 20 singles: "Let's Dance," "China Girl," and "Modern Love." Identify this man who also recorded the songs "Young Americans" and "Space Oddity."

(JG) The people of its city originally protested its installation because it was built during a famine at taxpayer expense and because it displaced street vendors. Antonio Bernal wrote a report on its unveiling after its commission by the Pamphilj family. The artist, who also created Apollo and Daphne, was se- lected from several competitors by Pope Innocent the Tenth. The title subjects were selected as represen- tatives of the Renaissance-recognized four continents by its sculptor, Gianlorenzo Bernini. Name this sculpture in Rome's Piazza Navona [pee-ATZ-ah nah-VOH-nah] featuring the Rio de la Plata, the Ganges, the Nile, and the Danube.

answer: {Faraday's} Law of Induction or the {Maxwell}-{Faraday} Law of Induction

(JG) The resolution of the paradox associated with this law invokes Le Chatelier's [lih SHAHT uh lee airz] Principle to Lorentz forces on electrons; that paradox concerns a disk generator spinning against a brush. Homopolar generators and, in fact, all generators and motors make use of the consequences of this law. The negative sign indicates that it incorporates Lenz's Law, and Joseph Henry discovered it inde- pendently from its namesake. Identify this law of electrodynamics, one of Maxwell's equations, that can be written as the curl of the electric field equals negative the partial derivative of the magnetic B-field with respect to time, or as the induced electromotive force equals negative the change in magnetic flux with respect to time, and explains how a current is produced in a loop of wire turning in a magnetic field.

answer: {amphoteric} [{am foh TEHR ihk}]

(SS/RS) Aluminum hydroxide in solution has this property because of the partially covalent bond be- tween the hydroxide ion and aluminum ion. In basic solution, aluminum hydroxide becomes a Lewis acid because it accepts a pair of electrons. In acid, it absorbs protons. These chemicals are commonly used in buffers, because they are stable over a much wider pH range. Examples in the blood include the hydrogen carbonate ion and the dihydrogen phosphate ion. The BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry variety of this type of chemical can donate or accept protons, while the Lewis type can donate or accept electron pairs. Name this type of chemical, of which water is the canonical example, that can act as either acid or base.

(JP) This mineral is used to treat streams affected by acid mine drainage, and can be pulverized for use as mine safety dust, which is sprayed on walls to reduce the amount of coal dust in the air. When found in (*) crystalline form, it has a perfect rhombohedral cleavage, and leaves a white streak when rubbed on a streak plate. A primary component of limestone and marble, identify this mineral rated as 3 on the Mohs scale.
