(JG) This effect resulted in erroneous ordering of Flamsteed designations for some stars. Menelaus of Alexandria also made some measurements of this effect among stars, and the Poinsot [pwan SAHT] ellip- soid can be used to visualize this. Applied to orbits, this effect causes the Laplace-Runge-Lenz [lah- PLASS RUN-jee LENZ] vector to rotate, and types of it include Larmor, De Sitter, and Lense-Thirring. Mercury's is observable and was explained by Albert Einstein. On Earth, the torque-induced type applies to gyroscopes, and it can also be torque-free. Identify this effect by which rotating objects have their axis direction changed, often applied to spinning tops.

answer: Council of {Trent}

(AS) Pope Paul III was the first to propose this meeting as a way to deal with the spread of Protestant- ism through northern Germany. Its beginning was delayed by hostilities between Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, France, and the Turks. When it convened, there was some hope of finding common ground be- tween the two groups. By the end, however, the Jesuits had gained control of the meeting, and the decrees issued included the reaffirmation of the seven sacraments and the institution of Latin as the official lan- guage for Mass. Identify this 1545 event in European religious history that sparked the Counter- Reformation.

(RS) This phenomenon occurs mostly in the summer, especially at high altitudes. Its effects vary in size from about five millimeters up to one hundred seventy millimeters in diameter and are either aggre- gates of smaller objects or concentric layers of frozen condensate around a central nucleation site. Usually roughly spherical and sometimes pellet shaped, these objects form in cumulonimbus clouds with strong updrafts that form the front of a moving thunderstorm. If large enough, they can damage cars and even cause head trauma. Identify this type of ice precipitation.

answer: Robert Strange {McNamara}

(JG) After World War II, he and a group of Air Force buddies went to work for Ford Motor Company.

answer: {cyclohexane}

(JG) It can be used as an azeotroping [AY zee oh trohp ing] agent to purify isopropyl alcohol, and its oxidation can produce adipic [uh DIP ihk] acid. The most common process to produce it involves the hy- drogenation of benzene, and its major industrial application is in the production of nylon. It has a slight sweet odor and is almost insoluble in water. Its boat conformation is less stable than its chair conforma- tion. Name this common nonpolar solvent, a alicyclic [al ih SIHK lihk] hydrocarbon with chemical for- mula C6 H12.

answer: The Bridge on the {River Kwai} (accept no substitutions for "on")

(RS) In this movie, William Holden portrays Commander Shears, who uses bribery to avoid hard la- bor. Early in the movie, there is a significant conflict involving Colonel Nicholson, who eventually earns the respect of his adversary, Colonel Saito.

In fact, one of them still stands about three miles from the border with Thailand. Name this film starring Alec Guinness that won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1957.

answer: Emperor {Diocletian}

(AS) After a lightning bolt killed the Emperor Carus, this son of a scribe and imperial cavalry com- mander wasted no time mustering his legions and seizing power.

He is best known for dividing the empire into a four-part, power-sharing Tetrarchy.

answer: Donald Ervin {Knuth} [{kah NOOTH}]

(JG) He is responsible for a system of mathematical notation to easily write repeated exponentiation, his namesake up-arrow notation. His vector font language defines characters in terms of Bézier [BEH zee ay] curves; that language is Metafont. This man's uncompleted masterwork on algorithms was started in 1968 and is currently on the fourth of seven volumes. He developed a typesetting system particularly geared to technical work specifically for that set of reference books. He used to offer one hexadecimal dollar, or two dollars and fifty-six cents, for finding errors in it. The typesetting system, TeX [TECH], has version numbers that approach pi. Name this Stanford computer scientist who wrote The Art of Computer Programming.

(JG) One type of this is also called an arc-boutant and became popular in the 1100s. The general term refers to structures that fulfill the same broad role as a corbel. These structures date back to Mesopota- mian temples and were also used by the Byzantines, but are most associated with a French and German style of architecture that also featured ribbed vaults and was revived in 19th century England. They origi- nally compensated for insufficient roof support and also serve a decorative purpose. Name these struc- tures found mostly on the sides of buildings of the Gothic style, that come in clasping, setback, and flying varieties, perhaps most notably found on the Notre Dame cathedral.

(HT) Labeled by the journal Science as "Microbiology's Scarred Revolutionary," this scientist called for a less reductionist approach to biology and "A New Biology for a New Century." His work creating a taxonomy of 16s ribosomal RNA led him to formulate some of his most important theories. In addition to his most famous contribution to the world of biology, this man postulated the "RNA world" theory con- cerning the origins of life on Earth. Identify this American microbiologist who suggested a taxonomic system based on not two, but rather three domains.
