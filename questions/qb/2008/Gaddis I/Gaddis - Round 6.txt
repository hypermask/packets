answer: {aluminum} [or {aluminium}]

Silicates of this element are found in rocks such as kaolinite and andalusite, and along with manganese, its silicate is found in spessartine. Studies on freshwater snails show that orthosilicic acid aids in the removal of this element in vivo, while several plants resistant to it release organic acids to prevent its uptake. This metal's hydroxide is used as a binder for phosphate in hemodialysis, and absorption of this element's cation under acidic conditions causes ? hydrangeas to change from pink to blue. Organometallic compounds of titanium and this element make up Ziegler Natta catalysts, and this element is the central atom of a hydride is used to reduce esters and carboxylic acids, and is stronger than Sodium borohydride. For 10 points, identify this element which is extracted from bauxite via the Hall Heroult process.

answer: {cytochrome p450} monooxygenase [or {CYP450} or {just CYP}]

The thromboxane A2 synthase is the only member of type 5 of this family of proteins, though it lacks their most distinctive function, where as isoform 24A1 these proteins aids in the degradation of vitamin D3. The nuclear pregnane X receptor is known to regulate it, while drosophila strains resistant to DDT overexpress type 6g of these proteins. Some members of this family of proteins catalyze the rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of steroids and prostaglandins, while some others help rid the body of toxins by hydroxylating them at the heme cofactor found at their active sites and are the sites of drug metabolism. For fifteen points, identify this large family of monooxygenase proteins so named for their characteristic absorbance peak, and are found in large quantities in the smooth ER of the liver.

One of its namesakes also created a mechanism for synthesizing ketones and aldehydes with Choung Un Kim and an olefin synthesis with Ronald Winter. Although it does not involve an aryl ketone, it does produce the same result as the Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement and the Seyferth-Gilbert homologation. Like in the Wittig reaction, a dibromoalkene is formed via a ? ylide intermediate in one step, and its penultimate step sees the formation of an alkynyl-lithium from a dibromoalkene .FTP, this method of creating terminal alkynes from aldehydes, named for an American and a German.

answer: {Nuclear Overhauser} Effect

This effect was experimentally verified by Carver and Schlicter using electron-saturated samples of lithium, and one recently developed protocol that uses it is the DPFGSE experiment. The steady-state enhancement of this effect is derived by setting the ratio of bulk magnetization equal to the ratio of two gyromagnetic ratios, and for a short peptide, it must be measured in the rotational frame rather than the laboratory frame. Commonly used for protein domain structure determination, it is the basis of the ROESY and NOESY ? variations of NMR.
