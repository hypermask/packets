answer: {aza} or {aza modification} or {aza} reaction (4) [accept "{Darzens reaction}" until mentioned; prompt on "{asymmetric synthesis}" until "{chiral C}-{C bonds}"]

A highly diastereoselective one of these features the oxidation of an N-sulfinyl group into an N-Tosyl group which undergoes a 6 member transition state, and yields a product similar to that of the Wenker synthesis.  This term is also used to describe reactions which proceed in the presence cinchona alkaloids and a chiral Lewis acids catalyst to form chiral C-C bonds. In addtition to those variations of Darzens reaction, Baylis-Hillman reaction and the Henry and Michael reactions this term is most famously used to describe a reaction where the nitrogen atom is double bonded to a carbon atom on the diene or the dienophile, a form of the Diels Alder  reaction. For fifteen points, identify this three letter word which describes reactions using imines.

answer: The Work of Art in the {Age} of {Mechanical Reproduction}

The third section of this work cites the Viennese scholars Riegl and Wickhoff to argue that during "long periods of history, the mode of human sense perception changes with humanity's entire mode of existence." Its sixth section notes that the works of Atget demonstrated the growing superiority of exhibition value over cult value, and it later argues that works by the Dadaists "hit the spectator like a bullet." This essay contrasts the contemplative man with the distracted mass, compares painters to magicians and cameramen to surgeons, and ends by asserting that "Fascism renders politics aesthetic; Communism responds by politicizing art." It opens by describing the progression from woodcuts to lithography to photography to film, and argues that those media destroy the auras of the title entities by ? copying them.

Consoli et al. discussed data from recent high-precision ether-drift experiments which does not fit predictions made from CMB dipole data for the existence of this object. The GLIMPSE survey showed evidence for the existence of two galaxies in a Bautz-Morgan type I cluster located in it, the ACO3627, which was once known as the Norma supercluster. The Norma, Pavo-Indus and Virgo-Coma superclusters from a "great wall" like structure within this object which has no observed backside ? infall. Some studies indicate that mass estimates for it may be too high because infall in Shapely cluster was not accounted for, and the Zone of Avoidance has hindered the mapping of this object. It lies in the direction of hydra and centaurus, and is causing the Hubble flow of the Milky Way at 600 kilometers per second.

Arguably the most successful one was given at Delmonico, and present at all of them was Alexander Randall. Reporters dogged them for their similarity to each other, and also made fun of their frequent use of "my policy." They were greeted by listeners waving black flags in Cleveland, and they all were given under the pretext of a tour to dedicate a monument to Stephen A. Douglas in Chicago. They came in the wake of the a fractured convention for the National Union Party in Philadelphia, while their speaker was joined by David Farragut and Unconditional Surrender Grant but not Edwin Stanton.  Allegedly given while the president was drunk, the Democratic candidates supported by these speeches generally lost in the upcoming races to Radical Republicans.

answer: {Cooper pairs} (3) [prompt on "{superconductors}" until "{individual components}"]

Work on a Uranium-Germanium compound by Saxena et al. showed evidence for their formulation by spin fluctuation rather than the method originally proposed. Their individual components can be isolated by passing them through Luttinger liquids such as carbon nanotubes, even while those particles remain coupled, and they were recently found to exist in thin sheets of supercooled bismuth, which acts as an insulator. Experimental support for their existence was observed when the critical temperature of mercury changed with varying isotopes. Existing due to ? phonon exchange, for 10 points, identify these sets of entangled electrons which are central to the BCS theory.

answer: {Nuclear} factor {kappa} B

The YopJ factor from Yersina pestis inhibits the protein responsible for inhibiting this factor in the cytosol, and some members of this family mature after degradation of their C-terminal ankyrin repeats. The Relish protein in drosophila is one member of this family. It is phosphorylated via the ZAP70-Protein Kinase C cascade, and the activation of Akt by Toll-like receptors has the same effect. Usually bound to Ik-beta-A in the cytoplasm, all proteins in this family are homologous to the Rel oncogene.  Initially discovered as an enhancer-binding protein in B cells, its phosphorylation allows it to be taking up by nuclear pores. For fifteen points, name this "master regulator," a transcription factor and oncogene responsible for cellular responses to stress, disease, and a million other things.
