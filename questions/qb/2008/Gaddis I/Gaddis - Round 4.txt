answer: {Tanabe}-{Sugano} Diagrams

These constructs are similar to Orgel diagrams except for their ability to take electron-electron repulsion into account, and these diagrams obey the “non crossing rule” for states of the same degeneracy. Those that map out complexes with both low and high-spin states have a sharp vertical line marking the transition due to the Jahn-Teller effect, and both axes of them are normalized by the Racah parameter B. Used to find allowed transitions between various Russell-Saunders states, for fifteen points, name these diagrams that plot normalized energy differences in electronic transitions against the ligand field splitting energy of transition metal complexes, named for two Japanese chemists.
