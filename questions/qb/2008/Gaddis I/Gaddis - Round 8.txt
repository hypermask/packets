answer: Henry Ossawa {Tanner}

This artist's wife Jesse Macauley Olsson was the model for Mary in his painting of the annunciation, which depicts Gabriel as a column of light. His move to Palestine from 1897 to 1899 inspired his paintings Daniel in the Lion's Den and Nicodemus Visiting Jesus. Alain Locke attacked his painting of an old man sitting at a table saying grace for its lack of “racial realism,” and his painting of a man sitting in a chair teaching a young boy to play a stringed instrument was inspired by Paul Laurence Dunbar's poem “A Banjo Song.” A student of Thomas Eakins, for fifteen points, identify this artist of The Thankful Poor and The Banjo Lesson, the foremost African-American painter of the late 19th century.

answer: {Hartree}-{Fock} (3) theory or model or method or {equation} [prompt on "{Self}-{consistent field}" until mentioned; do not accept "{Hartree method}"]

A program developed by Polish scientists uses a Cartesian deformed harmonic-oscillator to perform calculations when Skyrme interactions are considered along with it. The Kohn-Sham equations calculate the quantity associated with it but use the density functional theory instead. The Hall-Roothaan equations are linear combinations of basis functions used in this model and the Møller-Plesset improvement to it incorporates correlation to the operator that is formed after each iteration of the procedure. The introduction of Slater determinants to this theory addressed its inability to account for the antisymmetry principle and it assumes the ? Born-Oppenheimer approximation. It exists in restricted, restricted open-shell, and unrestricted varieties based on the spin and the existence of singly occupied orbitals. For 10 points, identify this self consistent field method which approximates the ground state energy of an N-body system, named for a British and a Russian physicist.

Oscar Wilde's poem "Quantum Mutata" laments "Luxury with barren merchandise piles up the gate / Where noble thoughts and deeds should enter by: / Else might we still be" this man's inheritors. An essay by William Hazlitt asserts that "the fervor of" this man's "imagination melts down and renders malleable, as in a furnace, the most contradictory materials." Another poem calls this man "Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free," and asks him to "raise us up, return to us again" because "England hath need of thee: she is a fen." In an epic poem, a young girl named Ololon reveals that she is searching for this man, after he enters the author's foot in a comet.

answer: {Elliot}-{Yafet} mechanism

A related mechanism, the dominant one for semiconductors, named for D'yakonov and Perel, and unlike this mechanism is independent of the mean free path. This mechanism occurs because in real crystals momentum eigenstates named Bloch States are not spin-eigenstates anymore. If this mechanism is the primary spin scattering mechanism, then the spin-flip length lambda-sf will be linearly proportional to the mean free path. Yielding a spin relaxation rate of 1/T, for twenty points, name this main spin-flip mechanism for metals.

Recent missions to discover more information about these objects include the high altitude flights conducted by the Southwest Research Institute, necessary to reduce twilight effects. The MESSENGER probe will potentially provide more information about these bodies, which may be difficult because the Yarkovsky Effect might have resulted in the destruction of all of these objects greater than 1 kilometer in diameter. They are hypothesized to exist in regions between 0.06 and 0.21 ? Astronomical Units away from the Sun, and would provide for why a certain planet has craters and a high precession in its perihelion.

A 2000 study discussed the possibility of an exchange factor involving the plasma membrane and this molecule in chromaffin cells. A version of this molecule with four attached phosphate groups is an alarmone that regulates the stringent response in E. Coli.  Hoogsteen bonding stabilizes the square arrangement of these molecules in a namesake quadruplex than can be found in vitro in telomeres, and its deamination results in the production of ? xanthine. Attached to a ribose, its phosphorylation results in a molecule that acts as a substrate for synthesizing RNA, and proteins involving them act as regulators involved in second messenger cascade reactions; an example of the latter is stimulating the use of ATP in producing cyclic AMP.
