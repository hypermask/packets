answer: {uniform} distribution

Van der Corput's theorem concerns sequences whose differences of terms have this property. The Marsaglia polar method is a refinement of the Box-Muller transformation, both of which generate two normally distributed random variables given numbers taken from this distribution. For a Poisson process, the vector of gamma-distributed arrival times has the same distribution as the order statistics of a sample of random variables from this distribution, while the k-th order statistic of n independent and identically-distributed random variables from this distribution is beta-distributed. On the ? unit interval, equidistribution deals with sequences, mod 1, that have this distribution. FTP, name this probability distribution for which each value has the same probability of occurrence.

He and Yu proved these relations in a four dimensional one-loop system, and one of their namesakes derived transverse relations between Green's functions that complement these statements by replacing inner products with wedge products. In external non-Abelian gauge vector fields, an anomaly in these relations occurs due to the axial current divergence. Originally used to relate the wavefunction of an electron to its vertex renormalization factor, in general they are relations between correlation functions in a quantum field theory. For fifteen points, name these doubly eponymous quantum analogues of Noether's Theorem, named for British and Japanese scientists.

The "Area X" sends signals to the lateral magnonuclear nucleus of the nidopallum which helps coordinate the repetitive nature of this, while Sturnella neglecta was discovered to belong to a separate species from S. magna because of the difference in this. In most organisms, the posterior descending pathway is essential in acquring it while the anterior forebrain pathway  is involved in learning this ? behavior. Those pathways originate at the High Vocal Center, from where signals are directed to the hypoglossal nucleus, and it usually more developed in males.

The theoretical model for the Stevens rearrangement favors a transition state with this property, while photochemical reactions with this transition state prefer a suprafacial configuration. Compounds possessing this property can be stabilized in transition metal complexes, and Li 4 Al 4 is an all metal species that possesses this property. Valance bands are out of phase in the ground state for compounds with this property according to the two state model. Open chain versions of compounds with this property undergo conrotatory cyclizations according to the Woodward-Hoffman rules. This property is associated with a higher magnetic ? susceptibility exaltation due to the induced paratropic ring current and inner protons are significantly more deshielded than outer protons on rings with this property. For 10 points, identify this property exemplified by planar molecules such as cyclobutadiene which have exactly 4 n pi electrons, disobeying Huckel's rules, and are more unstable than non-aromatic compounds.

answer: “The {Fixation} of Belief”

This work argues that because humans gain an advantage from thinking “pleasing and encouraging” thoughts instead of truthful ones, natural selection might lead to “a fallacious tendency of thought.” The author states that "the greatest intellectual benefactors of mankind have never dared, and dare not now, to utter the whole of their thought" because those who hold a tabooed belief are "treated with a cruelty less brutal but more refined than hunting you like a wolf." It argues that inquiry is motivated by the desire to eliminate the irritation caused by doubt, and explains the methods of tenacity, authority, and a priori reasoning, which lead to the title condition. It concludes that the scientific method, which produces objective certainty about the real world, is the best way to produce the title state.
