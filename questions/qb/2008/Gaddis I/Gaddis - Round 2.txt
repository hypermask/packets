One man of this name was killed when his ship was boarded by Calpurnius Asprenas, although he had earlier made plans to take Syria and had actually succeeded in taking the island of Cythnus and arming its population. Another man of this name was recognized by Parthian king Artabanus III out of disrespect for Titus and was also known as Terentius Maximus.  Tacitus reports that the first one of these was a slave from Pontus. They are associated with the Anti-Christ, as that word derives from the Greek spelling of their namesake, a man who ordered the Second Temple of Jerusalem to be destroyed. Their existence was helped by the general populace not believing that their namesake had stabbed himself with ? Epaphroditos's help, and they all tended to be good at playing the cithara.

answer: {cyclins}

One type of these found in frog oocytes has an NES between residues 108 and 117 which localizes it to the cytoplasm, and type T of these facilitates interactions between Tat and human TAR. Meriolins are a class of compounds that inhibit the growth of enzymes with which they associate, and a double knockout of type E of these inhibits the endoreplication of trophoblasts and prevents polyploidy. The MPF is a complex containing type B of these, which is degraded after a cell begins ? mitosis, and phosphorylating PRb results in translation of one type of these proteins which results in the initiation of the S phase. For 10 points, identify these compounds that form a complex with certain kinases that "depend" on them and regulate the cell cycle.

answer: Richard {Serra} (4)

This artist's early works include "splash" sculptures created by throwing ladles of molten lead at a warehouse wall and a series of "prop" sculptures featuring unattached parts balanced by the forces of gravity. Two congruent rectangles and squares make up his sculpture Equal-Parallel: Guernica-Bengasi, and this sculptor's more recent creations include Band and Torqued Torus Inversion. He helped Robert Smithson create Spiral Jetty, and sculpted a series of "torqued ellipses" for the Bilbao Guggenheim.

answer: “{Politics} and the English {Language}”

This work argues that every ready-made phrase “anaesthetizes a portion of one's brain,” and posits the necessity of letting “the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around.” This essay uses the image of a speaker whose glasses turn into “blank disks which seem to have no eyes behind them” to illustrate that “orthodoxy...seems to demand a lifeless, imitative, style.” It updates a clear passage from Ecclesiastes into “modern English of the worst sort” to explain the perils of dying metaphors, pretentious diction, and meaningless words, and explains that in modern times, “political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.” Connecting the decline of the second title entity with political conformity, FTP, name this essay by ?

While this painting was on display in the “Egyptian Hall” in Piccadilly, its artist painted proto-Realist lithographs such as Pity the Sorrows of a Poor Old Man for his collection, Various Subjects Drawn from Life and on Stone. Savigny and Correard provided the primary source material for this painting. Its artist had originally planned to use the traditional abolitionist image of a shackled man praying, and women were also present in early versions depicting a mutiny. Eugene Delacroix posed for this painting, whose artist allegedly made preliminary sketches such as Study of Arm and Two Feet for it at a ? morgue. It includes a gray haired father who mourns his dead son, as well as a hollow torso on the left and a bloody hatchet implying cannibalism.

answer: {graphene}

A group led by deHeer observed the fractal nature of resistance vs. magnetic field plots in this material, and a paper by Ostrovsky et al. proposed a model for the anomalous quantum hall effect observed in it based on Anderson localization instead of Landau level structures. Depositing it epitaxially on substrates such as silicon carbide can induce a band gap which it lacks because its conduction and valence bands meet at vertices of its Brillouin zones. Electrons moving through this material obey the Dirac equation for relativistic fermions, which allows one to test the Klein paradox, and it is also known for its ballistic transport of electrons, which makes it a valuable material for field-effect transistors. First isolated by Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov in 2004, for twenty points, identify these sheets of sp2 hybridized carbons, which can be stacked to form graphite.

answer: {Grover's} Algorithm

It is implemented by a superposition of all possible values produced from a column of Hadamard operators. This algorithm contains a namesake iteration which rotates a single state by some 2 times theta or 120 degrees, effectively converting the s state into the w state. This optimal algorithm solves the problem of efficient collision detection. While working at Bell Labs, its formulator suggested an application where this algorithm beats the traditional N / 2 operations required to find a name in a random phone book with 50% probability. Unlike Shor's Algorithm, which runs in Big O of log of n cubed time, it runs in Big O of square root of n time. For fifteen points, identify this quantum sorting algorithm.
