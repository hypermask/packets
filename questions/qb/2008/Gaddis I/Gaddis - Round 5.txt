answer: {Atharvaveda} (4)

It is available in two recensions, the Saunaka, which consists of 730 mostly metrical hymns, and the Paippalada. Because it contains both wholesome, auspicious “white magic" and the terrible “black magic” of the Angirgas, it is sometimes known as its eponymous avangirasah. It contains charms to counteract diseases and possession by evil spirits; prayers for health and longevity and happiness and prosperity, and spells pertaining to various kinds of relationships with women. Also known as the Veda of the Pañcakalpins, because of its unique content it was the last of the Vedas to be recognized as authoritative. Less restricted and grammatically pure than the Rig Veda, for fifteen points, name this work, which along with the Sama and Yajur composes the four major Vedic samhitas.

A theorem which states an infinite set of points all at an integral distance from each other are collinear is named for Anning and this man. Along with Straus, he is the namesake of a conjecture which states that the sum of three distinct unit fractions is equal to four times another unit fraction always holds true. The generalization of Turan's theorem to non-complete graphs is a theorem named for him and Stone, and the sum of the inverses of the Mersenne primes is a constant named for Bordwein and this man. An inequality relating the distances of a point inside a triangle to the vertices and sides is named for this man and Mordell. Known to refer to a set of elegant proofs comprising ? "the book," he is better known for his solutions of Chebyshev's theorem and the Prime Number theorem. The subject of Paul Hoffman's The Man Who Loved Only Numbers, for 10 points, identify this prolific Hungarian mathematician, whose namesake metric describes the distance of collaboration between himself and another scientist.

Prominent beaks can be found on the pedicle valve of the Kutorginida order in this phylum, while a very small number of Thecideida are still alive today from this phylum. The Lingula genus is unusual amongst them because it consisted of burrowing species, and they have historically been divided into Articulata and Inarticulata classes. Like Bryozoa and Phoronida, they possess a feeding organ known as a lophophore, and their abundance in the Paleozoic era make them the most common extant fossils. Although they look similar to clams ? because they all possess two shells, they are evolutionary divergent and are predominantly found in trenches or polar regions. FTP, identify this phylum, sometimes known as lamp shells.

answer: {reinforcement} [prompt on {learning}] ({1})

The cart-pole problem and the Tsetlin automaton model this behavior, whose problems include the credit structuring and partial observability problems. The Rescorla-Wagner equations attempt to model this behavior computationally, and Barto applied actor-critic architecture to the basal ganglia to suggest that it causes this behavior. According to the Premack Principle, optimizing this process requires creating a hierarchy of probable behaviors. This process can be accelerated by shaping, and schedules of this behavior include fixed-interval and variable-ratio. Thorndike's Law of Effect describes this behavior, while ? Skinner argued that it occurs when a subject learns the association between a response and its outcome. The opposite of punishment, FTP, name this type of learning originally defined by Pavlov as the strengthening of the association between a conditioned and an unconditioned stimulus.

answer: {acidity} functions (3) [prompt on “{basicity functions}” before mention since the {term} is {uncommon}]

The Cox-Yates equation is an example of an "excess" type of these, and is a modification of the Burnett-Olsen function, which is itself is a more general form of one of these.  One of these developed by Stevens, Yates, and Katrizky is based on primary amides, and experimental data on one developed by Stewart shows that the activity coefficient of the media used to measure the namesake property is based on the dielectric constant. The most commonly used one employs a set of nitroaniline references and was developed by Louis ? Hammett. They are measured using similar indicators of varying strengths and their development accounted for compounds with a stronger proton donating ability than H2SO4. FTP, name these functions which improve on the measures approximated in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the pH scale and encompass all functions measuring “basicity”.
