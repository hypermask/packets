answer: {Sackur}-{Tetrode} equation

It was restated by R.P. Bauman to include a term for the logarithm of the mass, while Saul Dushman demonstrated that it implied a universal thermionic emission constant which was later calculated by Bridgemann using this equation. It is only valid if the volume divided by the number of particles in the gas times the thermal wavelength cubed is greater than one because it obeys Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. This equation's namesake constant is equal to this equation's value at ? one degree Kelvin. Deriving it requires the resolution of the Gibbs paradox and it allows for the expression of energy solely in terms of entropy and volume. For ten points, name this doubly eponymous equation used to calculate the entropy of a monatomic ideal gas.

T.G. Cowling suggests that no axisymmetric, or even two-dimensional version of this theory can exist. Hide offers that its asymmetry could be accounted for by the Taylor-Proudman theory, while the Rikitake model exhibits irregular reversing behavior. Qualitatively, Elsasser and Parker claim that a combination of differential rotation and convective helical motion could explain this and is known as the alpha-omega mechanism. Mathematically, the presence of Coriolis acceleration and the Lorentz force complicate the ? Magnetohydrodynamic equations that are used to describe plasma equilibria and plasma waves and instabilities.
