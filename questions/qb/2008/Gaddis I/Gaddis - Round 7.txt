answer: “{Fenimore Cooper's} Literary {Offenses}”

This work notes that the central figure "is more interesting when he is not noticing what he is about than when he is" after discussing the improbability of a scene where three bullets are fired into the same hole. Beginning with laudatory quotes from Wilkie Collins and Brander Matthews, it describes eighteen violations of "rules governing literary art in romantic fiction" and argues that the central figure "saw nearly all things as through a glass eye, darkly." It attacks as nonsensical a scene where five Indians jump for and miss a boat, and calls the central series of novels "the Broken Twig series." Concluding by calling The ? Deerslayer "a literary delirium tremens," FTP, name this 1885 essay lampooning errors made by the author of the Leatherstocking Tales, written by Mark Twain.

answer: {Gelfond's} theorem [accept {Gelfond}-{Schneider theorem} before "{Schneider}"]

Zuehlke showed that Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem can be extended to Gaussian integers using this statement, and comically noted that the proof "almost fits in the margin." Its namesake and Kuzmin used Siegel's lemma to extend it to the real quadratic field, and it was generalized by Alan Baker, who proved the linear independence of an arbitrary number of logarithms. Proving Schanuel's conjecture would imply both the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem and this theorem. Its namesake also lends his name to a constant sometimes called Hilbert's constant, which is equal to 2 raised to the square root of 2. The first approach to a solution for Hilbert's 7th problem, for 10 points, identify this theorem which states that if a is algebraic and b is both algebraic and irrational, then a raised to the bth power is transcendental, which is sometimes also named for its independent discoverer Theodor ? Schneider.

answer: Les {Nabis}

One member of this group painted a portrait of another holding a crook and reading from an illuminated manuscript with a red halo around his head. Another member, nicknamed the Zouave, depicted a red mirror above a faceless man in black in The Green Interior. Paintings by members of this movement were often featured in La revue blanche, which was published by Misia and Thadée Natanson. Its founder was called "the one with beautiful icons," while another of its members' fascination with ukiyo-e and kakemono inspired paintings like Les Femmes au Jardin and earned him the nickname "le Japonard." Its members were inspired by a multicolored painting on a cigar box titled The Talisman, and included Paul Ranson, Edouard Vuillard, Pierre Bonnard, Paul Serusier, and Maruice Denis. FTP, identify this post-impressionist French artistic movement named for the ? Hebrew word for prophets.

During this period, one figure consulted a piece of quartz crystal, seeking to attack a neighboring tribe which had killed his father, but after being forbidden three times by the crystal's divining arrows, he shouted at it "Go bite your father's penis!" The Fitan records that "the buttocks of the women of Daws wiggled before Dhu al-Khalasah" during this period. Samiri brought the golden calf to Moses during this period. At its end, a general was sent to Nakhlah to destroy a sanctuary, and eventually saw a naked woman with wild black hair and slew her, thus destroying Al-Uzzah. This period included important fairs at Ukaz and Mina', and an prominent deity of this period was turned into in a doorstep. Famous for figures such as Imru' al-Qays and for the establishment of ka'abas at Sindad, Najran, and Makkah, for twenty points, name this period before Islam where deities like Al-Lat, Manat, and Hudal were worshiped.

answer: the {Black Panther} Party [accept {BPP}] ({1})

An Israeli group named for this organization was founded by Saadio Marciano and Reuven Abarjel, and fought for the rights of the Mizrahim. This group took their name from an emblem adopted by the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, and one member of this organization, Michael Tabor, critiqued the police's drug policies in his essay "Capitalism Plus Dope Equals Genocide." This organization demanded “an immediate end to all wars of aggression” and “decent education...that exposes the true nature of decadent American society” as part of its Ten Point Plan. It ran the Free Breakfast for Children Program, and raised money to buy shotguns by selling copies of The Little Red Book to students at ? Berkeley.  Along with similar groups like the Young Patriots and Young Lords, it formed the first Rainbow Coalition in 1969 thanks to the efforts of Fred Hampton.

answer: {Concerto} for Orchestra

In one section of this work, the oboe and clarinet alternate similar three note-phrases prior to the entrance of the bassoon and the rest of the orchestra. Each pair of instruments is assigned a different interval throughout that section, which precedes its slow third section, “Elegia.” Sir George Solti found a mistake in the tempo marking in one of this work's sections, which originally contained “Presentando” in its title. Its composer parodied a section of Shostakovich's Leningrad Symphony in its fourth movement, “Intermezzo interrotto.” Sections like the “Introduzione” and “Giuoco delle coppie” or “Game of the pairs” precede its finale, the last and longest, by far, of its five movements. For fifteen points, name this contradictorily-titled work by Béla Bartók.

answer: {Reflection} [accept {Shading} and {Reflectance} before "{Lambertian}"]

One type of this can be approximated with a model that incorporates hardness and which is similar to the Oren-Nayer model, the Blinn model. The Cook-Torrance model involves terms for surface roughness and geometric attenuation and implements a four dimensional model for it, the BRDF. Another model of this process employs a namesake interpolation and combines the constants ks, kd, and ka and is known as the Phong model. The ? Lambertian model for this does not change based on the position of the viewer and is used in modeling the diffuse form of this, the opposite of the specular type of it. The angle of this is equal to the angle of incidence, while at angles larger than the critical angle, the total internal type of this occurs. FTP, identify this phenomenon commonly produced by lakes and mirrors.

answer: {Ballistic}: {Ecks} vs. {Sever}

Zombie Studios didn't end up releasing a PS2 version of this game in 2002, while its sequel has a password of "zorro" for one version of level nine as a sort of in-joke. That sequel also provided greater control by letting the player press select to unlock the aiming cursor, and the Bam Entertainment original featured a plot that involves a woman who used to be in the NSA being hunted down by an agent under FBI chief Mills. The sequel's story ties in more closely to the film this portable game is based on, probably involving some bullshit about DIA director Robert Gant being kidnapped and the use of what Wikipedia calls a "nanobot assassin". For 10 points, identify this astonishingly good GBA first person shooter released a year before a ridiculously bad 2002 spy film pitting Antonio Banderas against Lucy Liu.

answer: {Tanzimat} reform period [prompt on "{reforms}" or other {English} synonyms; {term literally means re}-{ordering}]

After this period, the play Cyrano de Bergerac could no longer be performed due to a ruler's sensitivity about the size of his own nose. The first of the documents which give this period its name was the source of hilarious puns due to its name's resemblance to the word for "dung hole," and this period saw the issue of the kaime, a form of paper money. During this period, the Society of Zealots plotted to overthrow the government in the Kuleli incident. One of the leaders of this period was shot by a Circassian named Hasan, and its important undertakings included the change of the Agnam (AH-NAHM) Vergisi and the use of muhassils in place of previous tax farming. Led by such men as Reshit ? Pasha and Midhat Pasha, its most important accomplishments were the establishment of the nizamiye system, the Hatt-i Humayun of 1856 and the Hatt-i Sherif of Gulhane of 1839.

answer: Capital {Asset} Pricing Model

Ongoing research by Jagannathan and Wang follows up on Mayer's work on this model, assuming human capital in their measure of wealth, while Banz used a method similar to that of Black and Scholes to test whether firm size explained any residual variation. Fama and French developed a three factor model in place of it, and Richard Roll's critique of it noted that “the market portfolio is unobservable.” Stephen Ross developed Arbitrage Pricing Theory in place of this model, while Jensen's alpha is often used to measure the excess return a security provides as predicted using this model. All portfolios satisfying this model can be found on the Markowitz efficient frontier. Introduced by Lintner and Sharpe, for fifteen points, name this financial model which relies on the market risk premium and a financial instrument's beta to determine the appropriate rate of return.
