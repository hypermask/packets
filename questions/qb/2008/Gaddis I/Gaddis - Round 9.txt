answer: {Catherine} the Great [or {Catherine II}]

In one work by this writer, the Turk Durfedzhibasov comically can't figure out the word for "sheep" and the German Baron von Donnershlag tries to impress his way into an audience with the title character Khrisanf by claiming "sixteen grandfathers and grandmothers." That play, A Prominent Nobleman's Entrance Hall, is the most notable literary work by this ruler. Among those who led revolts against this ruler was the German Ohotyn-Leuchtenfeld, who came across another former rebel against this ruler, Maurice Benovsky, future Emperor of Madagascar, in the former's Aleutian colony. This ruler used the advice of Baron Igelstrom and made the Tatar leader Muhammad Djan-Hussein a paid state official. The Scottish admiral Samuel Greig won the Battle of Cheshme for this ruler, which eventually led to the Treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji. More famous for installing Stanislaw Poniatowski as king of Poland and deposing Shahin Girai, last khan of Crimea, For 10 points, name this lover of Orlov and Potyomkin, a Russian empress who succeeded Peter III.

The title character first sings at the "Window of Appearances," after which tubular bells reprise the coronation theme. In act III, scene 3 of this opera, the Scribe reprises the Prelude on lyrics from Frommer's travel guide, marking the shift from Year 17 to the present day. Just before that scene, Horemhab and Aye sing "Let the king care for his land" to convince the crowd to rise up and kill the title character and his family. The title character's "Hymn," which is always sung in the native language of the audience, is paired with Psalm 104 to emphasize his monotheism. Written in ?

answer: {chalcones}

Extremely low concentrations of Iron-Magnesium HMPA catalysts can add indole to these compounds, and a class of these compounds with boronic acid moieties was found to have anti-tumor properties and may work by inhibiting MDM2-p53 interactions. These compounds have a biosynthetic pathway very similar to that of stilbene, and in plants these compounds are generally isomerized into flavanones. These compounds can be synthesized via an aldol condensation of benzaldehyde and acetophenone derivatives by griding the reactants with a mortar and pestle. For twenty points, identify this class of aromatic ketones, whose solvent free synthesis is a hallmark of green chemistry.

answer: The {Subjection} of {Women}

This work states that "stupidity is the same the world over," and argues that if its principles are adopted, the brain trust of humanity could be doubled. In its first chapter, the author asserts that all laws begin by converting "a mere physical fact into a legal right," and argues that it is unnecessary to pass laws to prevent the central group from doing what it cannot. Its second chapter states that giving people "almost unlimited power" encourages them to abuse it, while its third chapter argues that there is no evidence that the title group is mentally inferior. The author finds no difference between St. Paul's statements "Slaves, obey your masters" and "? Wives, obey your husbands," and equates the marriage contract to "legal bondage." Co-written with Harriet Taylor, it uses the utilitarian principle of self-protection to argue that the title group should be allowed to vote. For ten points, name this feminist work by John Stuart Mill.

answer: {Hinton Rowan Helper}

This man spent his final years planning a “Three Americas” Railway running from Canada to South America, which he hoped would result in the displacement of minorities by whites. He denounced California in his first book, The Land of Gold, and argued that blacks should be expelled from the United States in The Negroes in Negroland. In another book, he argued that slavery prevented the South from industrializing, and kept non-slaveholding whites in a servile position.

answer: {Higgs} bosons

They are formed by the Bjorken mechanism, while another method of producing them is known as [this name]-strahlung. When vacuum expectation value confers a major part of their characteristic property, a quadratic term is introduced to hZZ coupling and a quartic term is introduced into the hhh coupling. In an experiment at the Tevatron it may have decayed into a bottom quark anti-quark pair, and in another experiment, a ? 160 GeV particle decaying into two tau leptons may have been one of them. They are thought to have arisen due to spontaneous symmetry breaking as the universe cooled. That symmetry breaking occurs with the introduction of a namesake field, which accounts for why a photon is massless compared to the W and Z bosons. For 10 points, identify this particle, the only one from the standard model yet to be observed, which is hypothesized to impart mass to matter.

answer: {Floating} Point Numbers

One mechanism for improving them can be inadvertently rendered ineffective by compiler optimization and is an algorithm named for Kahan. A proposed new standard for them will employ an "FMA" operation which, through the use of Horner's scheme, can improve the efficiency of polynomial evaluation. IBM's S/390 architecture defines a proprietary format for them, an architecture that employs various wrapping techniques like "late" and "long-to-short" in order to improve efficiency of operations on them. Thomas Nicely pointed out an infamous flaw in a certain operation on them in ? Intel's first Pentium chip in 1994. The most common implementation of them, IEEE 754, does not use two's complement but instead biases the exponent bits in order to improve the efficiency of comparison. That standard also provides for a mantissa and a sign bit. FTP, identify these ways to represent non-integer numbers on a computer, designated in C by appending an f to the end of a number.

In order to justify his celestial mechanics, he detailed a theory of electromagnetism for large bodies in Cosmos without Gravitation, and he analyzed the Ipuwer Papyrus's documentation of the Israelite Exodus in Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History. In his most controversial work, he uses a comparative analysis of myths to argue that the Earth has been subjected to a number of cosmological catastrophes and near-catastrophes, which has been in part obscured by a global “cultural amnesia.” FTP, name this controversial ?

Their publicly announced purpose was to fight a war against the Pisidians, and their ranks were bolstered by a secret agreement made with the Lacedaemonian government.
