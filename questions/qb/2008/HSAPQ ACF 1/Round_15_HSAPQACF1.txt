answer: {spin}

Gouldsmit and Uhlenbeck explained the mathematical theory of this property, which was proposed to account for the doublet spectrum of alkali metals in the Zeeman effect. This property is described by symmetric matrices named for Pauli, and splitting of a beam of silver atoms in the presence of a magnetic field confirmed the quantization of it in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Also known as intrinsic angular momentum, for 10 points, identify this fourth quantum number, which comes in multiples of one-half and is caused by the rotation of particles about their axes.

answer: parallax

A dynamical one may be taken by first applying Kepler's third law and the mass-luminosity relation for a binary system. Spectral and luminosity class data are employed with a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the distance modulus in the spectroscopic type.

For 10 points, identify this method of distance determination, whose namesake unit is around three point two six lightyears.
