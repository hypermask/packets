answer: {tension} [accept {magnetic tension} before “{Laplace}” is read; prompt on {force}]

Subtracting the magnetic pressure from this quantity gives the Lorentz force, and Laplace's Law states that pressure is equal to twice this quantity over the radius. In free-body diagrams, it must be represented as a vector pointing away from the object of interest because it can never push, only pull. A two-dimensional form allows small animals to walk on water and is known as the “surface” variety. For 10 points, identify this type of force exerted by taut strings, cables, and cords.

One of the two mainstream theories about this work notes that sketches for a scherzo part of it exist, and the ending of its slow second movement in E major clashes with the first movement in B minor.

In base 2, these objects are designated primitive if they generate maximum period linear feedback shift registers. The Chebyshev ones are a special case of the Jacobi ones, as are the Legendre ones. A Taylor series of order n corresponds to one of these with degree n, and irreducible ones cannot be factored, though the fundamental theorem of algebra guarantees they have at least one complex root. For 10 points, identify these mathematical objects whose terms are all proportional to a power of a variable, examples of which include 3y and x squared plus 1.
