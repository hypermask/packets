answer: {velocity} [prompt on {speed} before it is read]

The Peclet number is equal to the ratio of this quantity for convection to that for diffusion. A Pitot Tube is used to measure this quantity in gases, while its value in liquids can be determined using a Venturi Meter. Both of these devices make use of the idea that, like volume, as pressure increases, this decreases, a principle known as Bernoulli's Equation. When this is constant, acceleration is zero. For 10 points, name this kinematic quantity, the derivative of position, whose magnitude is equal to speed.
