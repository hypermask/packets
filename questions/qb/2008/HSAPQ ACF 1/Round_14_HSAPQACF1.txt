answer: {second law} of {thermodynamics} [accept {slight variations} in {phrasing}; accept {Maxwell's demon}

A being able to perceive which particles are moving quickly and which are moving slowly would be able to open and close a gate in violation of this principle, but such a being would need to expend a great deal of energy to operate.

It cannot be violated by that demon, since the demon would eventually have to erase information, which irreversibly decreases information entropy. For 10 points, identify this basic thermodynamic principle, stating that entropy tends to increase.
