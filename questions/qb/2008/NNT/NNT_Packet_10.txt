answer: {Polymers} (take {polymerization} or really anything involving the word {polymer})

The Flory-Huggins theory models these substances when put in solution and they are the subject of the Krotky-Porod worm like chain model. Their stiffness is measured with the persistence length, equal to one half the Kuhn length, which is used to model them as random walks. The Carothers equation gives their degree in the step-growth reactions used to create them, while the free radical mechanism is often used for chain-growth, or addition reactions. For 10 points, name these compounds, examples of which include nylon and which are composed of repeating monomers.

answer: Magnetic {monopole}

In Yang-Mills theory, one solution for it is named for t' Hooft and Polyakov. In some Grand Unified Theories, it is equivalent to the most basic state of a dyon. In another formulation, it is a topological defect in a compact U(1) gauge theory, and its existence is the subject of Dirac's quantization condition. The vector potential cannot be defined globally because the divergence of its curl is nonzero at the locus of this object, whose existence would imply modifications to Faraday's law of induction and Gauss's law of magnetism. For 10 points, name this theoretical fundamental unit of magnetic charge.

answer: {Human Immunodeficiency} Virus or {HIV}

It can infect dendritic cells via the DC-SIGN recptor and infection can be suppressed in vitro by the binding of ligands such as RANTES or SDF-1. The Tat gene produces proteins which bind to the TAR element and the binding of the RRE element to rev facilitates replication. Strains enter via the CCR5 or CXCR4 receptors and three gp41 molecules with a gp120 make up the Env cap of this virus. It consists of a capsid surrounding the p24 protein in a circular shape and it contains gag and pol genes. For 10 points, name this lentivirus which infects CD4+ helper T cells and leads to AIDS.
