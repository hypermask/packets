answer: Surface Tension

The Marangoni effect describes mass transfer due to differences in this quantity and its deviation from its planar value is represented by the Tolman delta. It can be described as Gibbs free energy per unit of surface area and the Du Noüy Ring method and Eotvos rule are used to measure this quantity. It is related to the vapor pressure in the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, and it is defined as the force along a line of unit length. For 10 points, name this quantity  lowered by the presence of surfactants, which makes falling drops of water into spheres and causes capillary action.
