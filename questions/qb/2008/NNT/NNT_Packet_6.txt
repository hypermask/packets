The activation of these molecules results in scramblase transport of negatively charged phospholipids to the surface of these molecules and also involves the activation of the arachidonic pathway, thus triggering the production of TXA2. Deficiency of one structure found in them results in a "grey" disease, and they contain delta or dense granules in addition to alpha granules, which produce von Willebrand's factor. They are regulated by thrombopoeitin and bud off megakaryoctyes. For 10 points, name these cytoplasmic bodies which lead to blood clots.

answer: John {Jay}

In 1792, he would run for office against George Clinton, but lost despite having more votes due to the votes of three counties being disqualified.
