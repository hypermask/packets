answer: Second Law of Thermodynamics

It follows from the H-theorem that T-symmetry does not function because of this idea. It was first described in relation to cyclical processes as the truth that the integral of the differential of heat divided by temperature equals the negative “equivalence factor”, a certain measure of unusable energy. A thought experiment that challenges it involves two chambers filled with molecules and is termed Maxwell's demon, and the “heat death” theory for the end of the universe follows from it.
