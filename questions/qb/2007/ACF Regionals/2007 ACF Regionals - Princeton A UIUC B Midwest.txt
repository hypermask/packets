answer: {potential} energy

Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis uses the minimum of this quantity to predict protein structures, and in the Henon-Heiles equation, this quantity is given by “one half r-squared plus one-third r-cubed times sine of 3-theta.” The Jeans length gives the scale at which one form of this quantity will result in the stability of a gas cloud. For a dipole in an electric field, it is the negative dot product of the moment and the electric field.  The derivative of this quantity with respect to a position gives the force field, and for a spring, it is given by one-half times the spring constant times the displacement squared. For ten points, identify this quantity, the energy a system has by virtue of its configuration.

answer: {Cyprus}

Its original inhabitants retained only the kingdom of Amathus after six Arcadian colonies were founded here. It may have been the Hittite trading center of Alashiya and was later claimed as a conquest by Thutmose III and Sargon II. In the later Middle Ages it served as a sugar plantation and a refuge for the deposed kings of Jerusalem, who ruled the island as the house of Lusignan and squabbled with the Genoese and Venetians. Captured by the Ottomans in the sixteenth century, in 1878 it became a British naval base. FTP, name this ancient source of copper, an island in the Eastern Mediterranean still disputed between Greeks and Turks.

One of this artist's works originally featured an angel, which was removed at the request of Clare Boothe Luce, who commissioned the painting depicting Hampshire House and the suicide of Dorothy Hale.  Images of Alexander the Great, Martin Luther, Ghandi, Napoleon, Hitler, and Marx are to the left of the embryo of Moses, in one of this artist's paintings.

answer: {Physics} ({Physica/Phusika})

Sarah Waterlow wrote a 1984 philosophical study on this work. The end of its most famous part uses the example of a wall, which comes about because stones sink to the bottom and wood floats to the top, or perhaps it comes about for protection. Prior to this, the work defines the ideas of luck and chance as those things which occur “for something” but only coincidentally, after discussing the four causes - the material, formal, efficient, and final causes - in Part 3 of Book 2. Book 1 gets straight to the main point discussing nature as a principle of change, and the final four of the eight total books all deal primarily with motion. FTP, name this work by Aristotle which deals with the development of a science, rather than mechanics or electromagnetics as its name might imply.

answer: Internet Protocol version 6 (prompt on partial answer or on “{IPng}”)

A technique using the 48-bit AGGR allows endpoint addresses to be stored in its header, enabling tunneling via its predecessor.  Created by a team lead by Steve Deering at PARC, convention states that strings of zeros in these addresses can be replaced by a double colon and the last 32 bits can be written in decimal instead of hex.  Although its predecessor's header is half as big and is limited to four billion nodes, address translation has slowed its adoption, even though its 128-bit address space allows for 3.4 times ten to the 38 nodes.  China's Next Generation Internet is abandoning the fourth version of, FTP, what addressing protocol usually paired with TCP that is to replace IPv4?

answer: Battle of {Flodden Field} (or Branxton Hill before mentioned)

Of the nobles on the losing side, only Huntly, Lindsay, and Home escaped alive. The last of them, Lord Home, is sometimes alleged to have made an agreement with Lord Dacre to sit out the battle, and was pilloried in its aftermath. A skirmish was initially fought at Milfield, on a pretext of instigation by a man called “the bastard,” John Heron, but the action then moved to Branxton Hill, which provides an alternate name for the battle. Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, commanded forces since the remainder of the English army was in France under Henry VIII, and the result was a crushing defeat of James IV. FTP, name this 1513 victory for the English over the Scots, described in Walter Scott's Marmion.

Other works that share its name include a setting of Guinaud's poetry by De Joncieres, an 1889 fantasy by Glazunov inspired by Liszt's tone poems, and an orchestral work prefaced by the poems of Levis, written by Gilson.  These works, along with D'Indy's L'Etranger, helped inspire this piece.  The first edition manuscript given to Varèse includes brass fanfares that were later removed from the third section, a dialogue between the wind and the title setting.  Proceeding “from dawn to noon” in the first movement, FTP name this Debussy piece whose second movement depicts the “play of the waves.”

He cleansed Pelops of blood-guilt in the western stream of Oceanus, and a practical joke by his uncle resulted in him ejaculating on his half-sister's thigh, making him the father of Erichthonius.  He drove off the River-god Scamander to help Achilles, and the blinded Orion took his apprentice Cedalion as a guide after finding his workshop.  During the revolt of the giants, he scalded Mimas with a ladle full of red-hot metal.  Pandareus and Tantalus conspired to steal a golden mastiff created by this god, and his other creations include a net that caught Ares in bed with his wife.

They contain large Sym plasmids that bear nod genes coding for factors that induce cortical cell division, and their gene expression is modified by uptake of flavonoids.  Following the recognition and attachment steps mediated by the protein rhicadhesin, they multiply in infection threads.  Effective strains produce large structures whose reddish color comes from the oxygen buffer leghemoglobin, which is partially encoded in the host plant.

The Nielsen type of these can be used to derive the Cesaro equation. One of these named after Cotes represents the solutions to a central orbit subject to an inverse-cubed force law, and a polygonal one may be generated from the ratios of the inradius to circumradius of a regular polygon. One of these objects named after Ulam is a graphical representation of the primes, while the Cornu type is a plot of the solutions of the Fresnel integrals. More famous are the Fermat and hyperbolic varieties, which correspond to special cases of the equation “r equals a times theta raised to the 1 over n power.” For ten points, identify these mathematical curves, of which the most famous is the Archimedean.
