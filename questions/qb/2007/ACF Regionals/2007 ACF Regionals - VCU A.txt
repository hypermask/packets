answer: {Mercury}

A localized region on this body has been termed “hilly and lineated,” or “weird terrain.”  That region of this body's Discovery Quadrangle is hypothesized to have formed due to seismic waves generated by the formation of the antipodal feature.  Smooth plains, including Odin and Tir Planitiae, surround its large, multiring Caloris impact basin.  The 43 arc-second per century forward shift in its perihelion was an early observed confirmation of general relativity.  FTP, name this terrestrial planet visited by Mariner 10, the innermost of the solar system.

The mystical levels of this group are described in the Epistles of the Brethren of Purity and Loyal Friends. They believe in the return of Muhammad at-Tamm from occultation, and subgroups include the Bhoras and Mustalis in Bombay and the Nizaris, led by the Aga Khan. The Assassins were also members of this sect, which was taken up by Ubayd Allah to found the Fatimids. Also known as the Stoppers because they believed the line of imams stopped at their namesake, this group was formed in 765 CE during a dispute over the successor to Jafar al-Sadiq. FTP, name this Shia group known either by the name or the ordinal position of that imam, the major Shiite division which is smaller than the Twelvers.

answer: {Niagara}

A “conference” by this name published the magazine The Truth and sponsored the preaching of Dwight Moody and the International Prophetic Conferences. That conference followed the Second-Coming theology of William Miller and was founded by James Inglis. Another organization with this name was co-founded at Mary Talbert's house by William Trotter and lasted until the Springfield riots made a new, integrated organization necessary. Organized as a response to the overly compromising Atlanta Compromise of Booker T. Washington by W.E.B. DuBois and became the precursor to the NAACP.

answer: {anhydrides} (or acid {anhydrides})

The cyclic type of these compounds may undergo de-symmetrization in the Evans reaction, and the maleic type can be created by the oxidation of benzene. They may be symmetrical or mixed, which affects the complexity of their nomenclature, and their oxygen atom may be replaced by sulfur, in which case the molecule may be given the designation “sulfane.” Consisting of two carbonyl groups with only an oxygen between them, the acetic type is a quite common reagent that is created when two molecules of acetic acid come together and kick off water. FTP, name this functional group with a name that literally means “without water.”

answer: James Grover {Thurber}

An anecdote in one of his books describes a scam to make Bolenciecwcz eligible for a football game by conducting an economics exam whose only question is “name one means of transportation.”  An anecdote about getting the “lady on the bookcase” cartoon published is found in another of his memoirs.  His memoirs include The Years with Ross, which describes his time at The New Yorker, and My Life and Hard Times. The title character of one of his stories is able to shoot the Webley-Vickers 50.80 with both hands, boss around Doctor Renshaw and captain a hydroplane, but only in fantasies that enable escape from his henpecking wife. For 10 points, name this author of “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.”

answer: {empiricism}

In the philosophy of science, James Brown declared that this “does not work” but John Norton denied that thought experiments can “transcend” it. Lynn Nelson attempted to establish a “feminist” version of it, and a Paul Feyeraband paper grouped it with explanation and reduction. Wilfrid Sellars paired it with “the philosophy of mind” in his magnum opus discussing the “myth of the given.” William James wrote some “essays in [the] radical” type of it, a 2000 article by Stephen Neale found a “milestone” of it, and John Locke is usually regarded as the forefather of the British type of it. FTP, give the term for this branch of metaphysics based on sense perception and direct experience, often contrasted with rationalism.

answer: {ATP} or {adenosine triphosphate}

A model for its synthesis incorporates the tenets of catalytic cooperativity and rotational catalysis, which were formulated by Paul Boyer.  This molecule binds to Walker A and Walker B motifs, and it can be synthesized via the binding change mechanism.  During the formation of pyrimidines, it joins with ribose 5-phosphate to form PRPP.  It is synthesized in the F0F1 complex, and it is catalyzed by dynein for use in flagella.  It is produced under low-oxygen conditions by substrate-level phosphorylation, as in the last three reactions of glycolysis.  FTP name this energy-carrying molecule produced by the electron-transport chain.

While taking them through Hylaea, their captor impregnated a half-woman, half-snake with Scythes, the ancestor of the Scythians.  Some of them were dragged backwards into a cave by Cacus, an uncle of their original owner.  Menoetes first reported their theft to their owner, a son of Callirhöe and Chrysaor.  Their theft from Erytheia followed the deaths of the herdsman Eurytion and the two-headed dog Orthrus, and they were eventually sacrificed to Hera by Eurystheus.  Acquired between the quests for Hippolyte's girdle and the apples of the Hesperides, FTP name these bovines belonging to a three-bodied giant.
