answer: {Charles Evans Hughes}

This man drew on his experiences as Secretary of State to write such gripping fare as Foreign Relations and Pan-American Peace Plans. This man fought with Congress for intruding on his territory with the Knox-Porter resolution, and his diplomatic achievements included the negotiation of the Treaty of Berlin with Germany and chairing the Washington Naval Conference. More famously, this man cast the deciding vote and wrote the majority opinion in NLRB vs. Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp. which upheld the constitutionality of the Wagner Act, a move that helped to diffuse the court-packing controversy sparked by the invalidation of the NIRA in the Schechter case while this man was Chief Justice. Losing in 1916 to Woodrow Wilson by only 23 electoral votes, for ten points, identify this American politician, the only man ever to resign from and return to the Supreme Court.

answer: An {Essay} on Man

The first three sections of this four-part work were published anonymously after poor reviews of the author's previous work addressed to Burlington.  Originally meant to be a part of a larger work, including some of its author's Imitations of Horace, its author claims to be "opening the fountains" in the introduction, and references Milton in his wish to "vindicate the ways of God to man."  Dedicated to Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke, its third and fourth sections deal with society and happiness, and its first section, dealing with the universe, evokes the Great Chain of Being and famously declares "whatever is, is right."  FTP name this philosophical poem consisting of four epistles written in heroic couplets by Alexander Pope discussing the human situation.

This painting's theme may have been suggested by the play The Three Cousins, though it was more likely inspired by Houdar de la Motte's opera ballet La Venitienne. Most of the artistic techniques were probably taken from the artist's close study of Rubens' Garden of Love. A statue wound about with flowers appears on the right. In the center, a man faces away from the viewer and holds a staff in his left hand, with his right arm around a woman in a bright gold dress, while four other couples stand under the large trees that dominate the upper right of this painting.  On the left, cherubs fly around the red and white sails of a golden boat, which people are boarding, while the far right features Cupid's quiver of arrows at the base of a statue of Venus. For ten points, name this painting depicting a leisurely trip to an enchanted island, a fete-galante by Watteau.

This man's early works include the string septet Shaker Loops and the piano piece Phrygian Gates.   His time as composer in residence for the San Francisco Symphony produced works like a tribute to the Second Viennese School, Harmonielehre, and a choral work using the text of a John Donne poem and two Emily Dickinson poems, Harmonium.  He used missing persons reports, internet postings, and cell phone conversations as the text for his 9/11 tribute, On the Transmigration of Souls, and wrote operas about the hijacking of the Achille Lauro and the visit of a President to a certain country.

answer: {Coptic} Orthodox

It was frequently persecuted by Melchites for its adherence to a Cyrilline Christology, and in 2001 Peter VII agreed to recognize its marriages and baptisms. The only pre-reformation church to use grape juice in communion, it is currently led by Shenouda III, and it traces its origin to the condemnation of Patriarch Dioscorus at the Council of Chalcedon. In communion with the Armenian Church and the other members of the Oriental Orthodox Communion, it granted autocephality to the Tawahedo Ethiopian church in 1959, and performs most of its liturgical rites in an extinct afro-asiatic language. For ten points identify this so-called monophysite church, centered in Alexandria, named for the dialect of Egyptian it uses in services.

answer: {acetylcholine}

The serine protease that normally breaks down this compound can be permanently inactivated by di-isopropyl-phospho-fluoridate, or temporarily inhibited by neostigmine, which is used as a treatment for myasthenia gravis because it prolongs the actions of this compound.  It binds with two distinct classes of receptors – one that comes in five types that are coupled to G proteins, and another class of ionotropic receptors.  Those muscarinic receptors for this molecule are found at effector organs of the parasympathetic nervous system, while nicotinic receptors for it are found at all autonomic ganglia and at motor end plates of skeletal muscles.  Broken down by a namesake esterase, FTP name this neurotransmitter synthesized from its two namesake constituents, one of which includes coenzyme A.

This event was supposedly portended by the eruption of the Kuwae volcano, which caused a “magnificent red fire” in the sky. One source is a diary on it written by contemporary Nicolo Barbaro. The German engineer Johannes Grant was called in early, but the construction of the “Cutter of the Throat,” or Rumeli Hisan, restricted naval support, and a causeway of greased logs across the Galata ended supply shipments from Genoa. The injury of Giovanni Giustiniani demoralized the defenders holding the Blachernae Wall, as did the use of the Basilic, a 27-foot long cannon which blasted at the Theodosian walls. FTP, identify this 1453 event in which Constantine XI died in battle and Mehmed II took control of the Byzantine capital.

answer: Desiderius {Erasmus} of Rotterdam

A posthumous edition of this man's writing was compiled by Beatus Rhenanus, who appended a life of him. He wrote an anonymous satire in which Pope Julius II attempts to storm Heaven with those killed in his wars, Julius Excluded. He discusses church abuses in his Colloquia, but considered his greatest work the compilation of a critical Greek New Testament, the basis of the Textus Recepticus. He is best known, though, for a satire in which the title figure is born in the “pagan Eden,” the Fortunate Isles, and nursed by Drunkenness and Ignorance as the daughter of Youth and Plutus, a work written to amuse this man's friend Thomas More. FTP, identify this Dutch humanist and author of In Praise of Folly.

This man's first administration saw the passage of the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, and as home secretary under Lord Melbourne he was responsible for reducing the number of capital offenses. His 1845 stance in favor of total free trade forced his opponent Robert Peel to follow him, and as foreign secretary, he proposed mediating the American Civil War, only to be denied by the man whose recognition of Napoleon III had caused the collapse of this man's first ministry. He spoke in 1817 in opposition to the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, but it was as paymaster under Charles Grey, in which capacity he fought for the rights of English Dissenters and Irish Catholics, that he saw his greatest success. FTP, name this liberal Whig, the driving force behind the Reform Bill of 1832 and Prime Minister from 1846 to 1852 and again from 1865 to 1866.

At one point in this work, an oath is sworn over a jug of Thracian wine after it is pointed out that sacrificing a sheep over a shield would be inappropriate.  The main character comes up with a metaphor of Greece as a piece of wool that needs to be spun into yarn, and when the Commissioner casts aspersions on this idea, Kleonike empties a chamber pot over him.  The chorus of old men tries to smoke out a group from their entrenched position at a site where Kinesias shows up with a neglected baby and an enlarged member.  Ending with an agreement aided by the naked figure Peace, FTP name this Aristophanes work in which the title character convinces Greek women to withhold sex until the Peloponnesian War is ended.

Artifacts bearing the name of Meskalamdug and Akalamdug were found in Early Dynastic II tombs in this city.  Its King Shulgi is considered the author of the first law code, and Messanepadda founded this city's first dynasty.  Its most prominent period, which followed Utu-Hegal's expulsion of the Gutians and preceded the Isin Larsa Period, was its third dynasty.  This site includes the remains of a temple to Nanna, and was the subject of excavations led by Sir Leonard Woolley.

The work of Vaughan Jones has connected these objects to the Ising model of statistical mechanics, while Dehn's theorem demonstrates that if one of these objects' namesake group is isomorphic to the integers, then the object itself is isomorphic to a closed loop. Dowker notation can be used to enumerate prime ones, examples of which are the hyperbolic, torus, and satellite types. The determinants of these structures are given by evaluating the Alexander polynmial at negative one, and other invariants related to these objects are the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials.

This man, who started two games for the Arizona Cardinals in 1994, hosted the 2006 Barefoot Open, so named because he prefers to play golf with bare feet. Defensive tackle Charles Martin became infamous for his dirty hit on this player, who first came to attention during the 1981 Holiday Bowl, when he led a miraculous comeback win over SMU while playing for BYU. In 1996, he won a rather ironic Super Bowl ring as a backup to Brett Favre, but he's better remembered for throwing deep to Willie Gault and mooning a television station helicopter en route to another Super Bowl win.

One particularly far-fetched theory finds information about this discovery in the short story “Dayspring Mishandled.” The team of Oakley, Clark, and Weiner shared credit for unmaking the truth about it, some 30 years after Raymond Dart insisted that his Taung skull was bona fide. Arthur Smith Woodward is generally thought innocent of this forgery, though his aid was enlisted by Charles Dawson, for whom this find was dubbed Eanthropus dawsoni. Actually consisting of a transported orangutan jawbone and some modern skull fragments, FTP, name this archaeological hoax discovered at the namesake village in Sussex.
