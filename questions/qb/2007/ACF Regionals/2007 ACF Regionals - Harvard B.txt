answer: {Pharsalia} or {Bellum Civile} or The {Civil War}

One character in this work uses a live snake as a whip to goad a reluctant ghost into reanimating a corpse.  One man has a nightmare in which the ghost of his former wife Julia foretells his death; his body is later cremated using burning brands stolen from another man's pyre by Cordus.  An army is single-handedly held off for a time by the heroic Scaeva near Dyrrachium, setting the stage for the fateful battle.  This poem breaks off shortly after Pothinus dies leading an assault against the palace of Cleopatra.  Another passage echoes Vergil's description of Priam's dead body in its treatment of the headless corpse of Pompey.  FTP name this epic poem centering on Pompey's conflict with Caesar, written by Lucan.

answer: {Arrhenius} Equation

This relation is extended by Randall-Wilkins theory and the substitution of Marcus theory into it will produce DeVault-type control coefficients. It can be used as an electronic model to predict failure mechanisms including void formation and metal migration, and is very similar to the Eyring Equation which also applies to mixed phase and condensed situations. The namesake pre-exponential factor assumes the constancy of the collision frequency and the steric factor. Its basic formulation states that the rate is equal to a constant times the exponential of negative E sub a over RT. FTP, name this equation of chemical kinetics including a term for activation energy, named for a noted Swedish chemist.

answer: Battle of the {Bulge} (or Battle of the Ardennes before mentioned)

A definitive study on this engagement was authored by Hugh Cole, who devotes a section to discussing the Losheim Gap. It also stresses the importance of the oft-overlooked Operation Bodenplatte carried out on a holiday and alternately known as Operation Hermann. The clash saw the murder of the Wereth 11, a group of waylaid black soldiers, and courageous stands at St. Vith and Bastogne, which turned the fight and made up for failure to garner intelligence through ULTRA. Anthony McAuliffe became famous for his reply of “Nuts” and Patton for his diary statement that it was “lovely weather for killing Germans.” FTP, name this final German offensive of World War II also known as the Battle of the Ardennes.

At the beginning of this work, the title character shows a reporter a picture of his wife and daughters, and later comments to his wife that unless another character becomes interested in paint, he'll never get the chance to be interested in Irene. The minister David Sewell advises the title character on his daughters' romantic difficulties in this novel, which ends with the marriage of Penelope and Tom Corey. The destruction of the Back Bay house and its burning from an unextinguished fireplace add to the title character's financial problems. Ending with the ruin of the title character by a railroad after he refuses to sell some property to Englishmen, for ten points, identify this novel about an entrepreneur, written by William Dean Howells.

answer: {Slaughterhouse} Cases (accept The {Butcher's Benevolent Association} of {New Orleans} v. The {Crescent City Live}-{Stock Landing} and {Slaughterhouse Company})

A dissent by Justice Swayne denied the authority of the court to "interpolate a limitation," while the majority opinion claimed that a piece of legislation passed five years earlier had only "one pervading purpose." Former Justice John Campbell argued for a broad interpretation of the amendment on which this case hinged, and a central distinction was between state and federal citizenship. Justice Field acknowledged the validity of the legislation but dissented from the majority opinion by Samuel Miller, since incorporation of the Crescent City Company was not necessary to achieve the purpose. Holding that the Fourteenth Amendment was limited to protecting blacks, FTP, identify this group of cases brought by a butchers' association.

answer: {Jeff Suppan}

This player has spent short stints with the Arizona Diamondbacks, who drafted him as their third expansion pick, and with the Pittsburgh Pirates, who traded him away with Anastacio Martinez and Brandon Lyon in return for Freddy Sanchez. Initially drafted by the Red Sox, he spent four mediocre seasons with the Royals after being acquired in 1998. Both of his career home runs have come off of Steve Trachsel, the last of which being the most memorable en route to a 5-0 victory in the playoffs. Just recently given a 4-year deal by the Milwaukee Brewers, FTP, name this pitcher who won MVP honors this year after starting game 7 in the NLCS for the St. Louis Cardinals, and is fittingly nicknamed “Soup.”

answer: {Joule}-{Thomson} or {Joule}-{Kelvin} effect

Some therapies for prostate cancer utilize this effect to grow ice on the prostate gland, thereby freezing the tumor. The entropy change with respect to pressure resulting from this effect is given by minus the volume over the temperature. This effect is used in one of the stages of the Linde cycle, and in order for cooling to occur, the gas undergoing it must be below the inversion temperature. For an ideal gas, its namesake coefficient, which is given by the derivative of temperature with respect to pressure at constant enthalpy, is zero. For ten points, identify this doubly-eponymous isenthalpic process, in which the throttling of a gas results in a temperature change.

answer: Wystan Hugh Auden

This writer classified clay and gravel plains and granite wastes as immoderate soils in his classic “In Praise of Limestone.”  In one poem he states of the title character, “The day of his death was a dark cold day,” and proclaims, “Let the Irish vessel lie / emptied of its poetry.”  He repudiated another poem in part because he found the line “We must love one another or die” over-obvious.  In addition to “In Memory of W. B. Yeats” and “September 1, 1939” he wrote a poem in which he notes that the “expensive delicate ship…Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on” even after seeing “Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky.”  FTP name this poet who considered Brueghel's Icarus in his “Musée des Beaux Arts.”

answer: {Mahayana} Buddhism

One of its namesake texts is the samgraha sastra by Asanga, and represents the Yogachara school of this teaching. Its only definitive sutra of Chinese-origin is the Platform Sutra, and some of its early texts may be traced to the Kushan empire monk Lokaksema. Containing the Sutra of Perfect Wisdom, it emphasizes the central role of karuna in the path to wisdom and formulates a doctrine of the “Three Bodies.” Its teaching of universal endowment with Buddha nature and transmission of excess merit explains why it disfavors those who manage to escape samsara, and prefers bodhisattvas instead. FTP, name this branch of Buddhism with a name literally meaning “The Greater Ox-Cart,” often opposed to Theravada.

At the International Monetary Conference, this man helped block James G. Blaine's bimetallism plan, and Blaine's work in the Pan-American Conference spurred this man to write the essay “Our America.” He published his own translation of Helen Hunt Jackson's Ramona and singled out “Ismaelillo” (eess-may-eh-LEE-oh) as his best literary effort. He published the Montecristi Manifesto scant weeks before his 1895 death at the Battle of Dos Ríos.

answer: {Bishops}' Wars (accept First {Bishops War} until after {Newburn})

One clash in this conflict was the Battle of the Bridge of Dee, which saw the Viscount Aboyne, the son of the Marquis of Huntly, driven back and defeated. A more substantial clash saw the Viscount Conway retreat after defeat of Henry Wilmot's cavalry at the Battle of Newburn. After that, the Treaty of Ripon was negotiated and provided for payment, one year after this conflict had been temporarily ended by the Peace of Berwick, negotiated by men including Alexander Henderson and the earl of Rothes, John Leslie. The Treaty of London was finally signed in 1641and provided the Covenanters with significant reparations. FTP, give the name for these wars fought against Charles I by the Scots from 1639-40, named for a certain religious office.

answer: {Carmichael} numbers

Korselt's criterion can be used the check for them, and they form the only candidates for solutions to Lehmer's Totient problem. In order to be one of these, a number n must divide the denominator of n-1th Bernoulli number, and their general definition requires that n is one if and only if the n-th power-raising function from the ring Z-sub-n to itself is the identity. Alford, Granville, and Pomerance proved in 1994 that there exist infinitely many of these numbers, beginning with 561, 1105, and 1729.  Squarefree and having at least three prime factors, these numbers satisfy the congruence of Fermat's Little Theorem for all choices of base.  For ten points, identify these numbers that are often also called absolute pseudoprimes.

answer: Ursula Kroeber {Le Guin} (note, in case anyone cares: Tehanu is the daughter of Kalessin, and The Dispossessed is set on Urras and Anarres; the rest should be fairly clear)

One of this author's stories is set during the Festival of Summer in a city whose grandeur rests entirely on the privations of a feeble-minded child kept locked up in a tiny room; the child's plight occasionally leads an inhabitant of the title city to leave for the mountains.  In addition to “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,” she wrote a novel set on the planet Urras and its moon Anarres.  A daughter of the dragon Kalessin is the title character of another of her novels, which continues the storyline of an early trilogy focusing on the wizard Sparrowhawk in such novels as The Farthest Shore and The Tombs of Atuan.

answer: {Black}-{Scholes theory/formula/model/method}

This theory has been extended by the construction of Biger and Hull. The risk-neutral measure of it can be given by the Carmeron-Martin-Girsanov theorem, and its most well-known variants are the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein method and the Garman-Kohlhagen measure, which extends it to foreign values. The market's expectation creates the volatility smile problem in this method, which assumes geometrical Brownian motion and an absence of arbitrage and delta-hedging.  Introduced in the Journal of Political Economy in 1973, it results in a partial differential equation and won Robert C. Merton a Nobel for work in 1997. FTP, name this economic formula, the most popular way of pricing options, named for two economists.

These compounds affect gene transcription by diffusing across the plasma membrane and causing receptor zinc-finger transcription factors to migrate into the nucleus.  They all have a cyclopentanophenanthrene nucleus, and in fungal cell membranes, some of these terpenoids act as precursors to vitamin D.  They are used to boost livestock production, maintain blood volume, and treat inflammatory and degenerative diseases such as asthma, arthritis, and AIDS wasting.  The hormones cortisol and progesterone are examples of, FTP, this class of compounds that all share the fused four carbon-ring structure of cholesterol, best known for their illegal bodybuilding effects.

The first theme of this D minor piece modulates to C major and reappears three times in full, beginning a fourth repetition as the music fades away.  That theme is set to the words “Meine Ruh is hin, mein Herz ist schwer.”  The climax is a high G harmonized by a C# diminished chord in the piano as the title character sings of the kiss of her beloved.  At that moment, the cyclic accompaniment figure in the piano pauses, and then builds momentum to a steady whirring after beginning from individual rotations of the title object.

answer: The {King James} Version or The Authorized Version

It supplanted an earlier effort by Matthew Parker, and drew heavily on previous work by John Rogers and Theodore Beza. Its origin lay in one of the points of the Millenary petition, which itself resulted in the Hampton Court conference, where its creation was authorized. William Wiston attempted a revision of this work in the context of reviving Arianism, while Samuel Wilberforce attempted a modernization and Rastafarians maintain that it is a corruption. Prefacing this work are the Epistle Dedicatory and The Translators to the Reader, and by royal order, there were to be "no marginal notes at all...but only for the explanation of the Hebrew or Greek words." FTP, name this popular translation of the Bible named for an English monarch.
