answer: Treaty of {Karlowitz}

This agreement was mediated by Lord Paget, who was acting as a foreign ambassador. Venice acquired most of Dalmatia and, in addition, took control of the Morea, though it was forced to give it back 20 years later by the Treaty of Passarowitz. The losers were additionally forced to cede Transylvania, Slavonia, and Hungary, leading one historian to pair it with the Peace of Ryswick signed two years earlier, referring to those treaties as the “pacts that shook the world.” Resulting in huge territorial gains for Austria, FTP, name this 1699 treaty often cited as the beginning of decline for the Ottoman Empire, named for a Serbian village.

answer: {metastasis}

The murine gene nm23 is a prototype for suppressors of this process.  Krukenberg's disease is an example of this phenomenon, and it may be studied with microcell-mediated chromosomal transfer.  Stromelysin and other matrix metalloproteases promote this process by destroying collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix, allowing cells to proceed through steps like intravasation and extravasation that permit their travel through the bloodstream.  FTP, identify this process by which cancerous cells migrate from a primary tumor to other sites in the body.

answer: the {Scriptwriter} (accept early {Pedro Camacho} [either name])

His first work concerned a doctor who discovers that his niece was impregnated not by her husband, Red, but by Robert, her brother. Shortly before being committed to an insane asylum, he penned a work about Mr. Bellmont, who has the embarrassing tic of trying to lick his own ear, which he developed after being ruined by his son, the most famous soccer referee in Peru. The unfaithfulness of this man's wife, a stripper, seems to have caused his irrational hatred of Argentines. This character's creator based him on Raul Salmon, a Bolivian coworker. FTP name this coworker of Mario Varguitas whose given name was Pedro Camacho, and who appears in the title of a Vargas Llosa novel along with Aunt Julia.

answer: {Liouville's} theorem

It can be derived by treating Jacobians as fractions and reducing them by one fewer variable, and in symplectic geometry it can be written by saying that the d-form of the structure has zero Lie derivative. Its quantum analogue is given by either the Lindblad or the Ehrenfest equations, and its generalization to collisional systems yield the Boltzmann equation. It also shares its name with a theorem from complex analysis which states that every bounded entire function must be constant. For ten points, identify this theorem of classical mechanics, which states that the volume of phase space does not change for a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian.

This adjective appears in the title of a song about a “man in the moon” who “taps at the window”; that song by Yo la Tengo refers to a “sarong” of this hue.  Another song mentioning this adjective in its title begins “unsealed on a porch a letter sat” and ends with the repeated line “I don't want to stay.”  A less cryptic song of this name was the second single off a 2000 album, and features the singer's claim that he “drew a line for you” and repeated requests to “look at the stars” and “how they shine for you.”  FTP, name this adjective which describes a “ledbetter” in a Pearl Jam song and which names a sappy hit by Coldplay.

answer: {Fischer} Esterification

Ficarro developed a "methyl-" version of this reaction for tagging peptides, and Schlater and Ziemnik's microwave catalysis was developed to accelerate the rate of this reaction. The use of KSF or a Dean-Stark apparatus may speed this reaction by eliminating water, driving the final step towards the products. In its final step, an oxonium atom loses water to produce the namesake product. Benzocain is a notable product of this reaction, in which a carboxylic acid and an alcohol are refluxed in the presence of an acid catalyst. FTP, name this esterification reaction named for a German chemist.

The Kyte-Doolittle scale is useful in predicting one kind of them, while the Davydov-Scott model examines the propagations of solitons along one type of them.  The antifreeze family contains the cold-resistant beta variety, while fumarase C and lipoxygenase contain the pi variety.  Turns of 120 degrees and i-i+3 ("i to i plus three") bonding define the more common 310 (“3 10”) variety.  The most common variety can form coiled coils, leucine zippers, and other protein structures.  FTP, name this structure, whose alpha variety is a basic structural component of proteins.

It was under the operational command of the 559th Transportation group, and it became more important after the naval interdiction efforts of Operation Market Time began to tell.  It was the target of Operations Steel Tiger and Barrell Roll, as well as the Popeye project, which aimed to reduce its effectiveness by extending the monsoon season through cloud-seeding.  From 1968 to 1970 Operation Igloo White, run out of Nakhon Phanom in Thailan, bombed it round-the-clock by B-52's.

The friendship between Polly O'Keefe and Max Horne forms the basis of Madeleine L'Engle's novel about one of these that is like a lotus. Tien Pao is adopted by a bomber squadron in a novel about the one "of sixty fathers" by Meindert de Jong, while a novel about the Malavoglia family by Giovanni Verga is known in English as the one "by the medlar tree."  A relationship with Elizabeth Siddal inspired Dante Rosetti's collection about the one "of life,” and a "green" one is erected by Don Anselmo in a novel by Vargas Llosa.  For ten points, identify this kind of structure, which has seven gables in a Hawthorne novel and is the location of mirth in a work by Edith Wharton.
