answer: {Q} cycle

In photosystem II, this process involves electron transfer to and within the cytochrome b/f complex.  In mitochondria, it sees the first donated electron reduce Cytochrome C while the second passes through cytochromes b566 (“b 566”) and b562 (“b 562”).  Assimilation of matrix protons into the radical molecule replenishes the reducing agent, ubiquinol.  Each ubiquinol oxidation is accompanied by the release of four protons into the intermembrane space, producing the pH gradient for chemiosmotic ATP synthesis.  FTP, identify this proton-motive cycle sharing its single-letter designation with a key coenzyme.

answer: {Hay}-{Bunau}-{varilla} treaty

One of the men responsible for negotiating this agreement had earlier published evidence in Le Matin which exonerated Alfred Dreyfus. Among the smaller islands addressed by this agreement were Perico, Naos, Culebro, and Flamenco, while damage resulting to private parties from construction was to be appraised by a joint commission from both countries party to it. It also provided for sanitation and water distribution in the city of Colon, while providing for an initial payment of $10 million and yearly payments of $250,000, and was repealed by the Torrijos-Carter agreement. Superseding a treaty bearing the name of one of its namesakes and that of Herran, for ten points, identify this 1903 agreement which gave the United States exclusive control of the Panama Canal.

At one point, the author uses the metaphor of building a house, saying that people will pronounce a house perfect when it is completed, but that one cannot pronounce anything perfect without knowing the intention of its maker. The paradox of Buridan's Ass is rejected as irrational, and its author later concludes that rational man is freer abiding by the laws of a State than living independently in solitude in part four, “Of Human Bondage, Or The Strength of the Emotions.” Presenting its author's double aspect theory of the mind, its first part, “Concerning God,” begins the distinction between such ideas as substance, attribute, and mode. FTP, name this magnum opus “presented in a geometrical order,” by Baruch Spinoza.

answer: integer or prime {factorization}

Computationally equivalent to determining if a number is a quadratic residue modulo a prime, among the algorithms proposed to solve it are an elliptic curve method named for Lenstra. Pollard's rho algorithm for achieving this iterates a polynomial formula until it falls into a cycle, while Fermat's method uses trials to find an appropriate difference of two squares and generalizes to the continued fraction method. A fast method for it is the quadratic sieve, and it can be done in polynomial time by the quantum-computational Shor's algorithm. For ten points, identify this problem in NP and co-NP, whose difficulty insures the success of RSA encryption, and which consists of breaking an integer into a product of primes.

He stated that he only vomited once in his life and confessed that his breast was shaggy in the self-satirical Misopogon, or Beard-Hater.  His Gallic campaign saw victory at Strasbourg, and ended when he was ordered to put down the siege of Amida, which led the Petulantes to revolt and crown him in Paris.  He ordered Alypius of Antioch to rebuild the second temple of Jerusalem and promulgated the School Edict, which prevented Christian schools from using pagan texts.  He also reversed the policies of his predecessor, Constantius II, declaring freedom of religion in a 362 edict.  Known for attempting to revive Hellenism, FTP name this Roman Emperor whose moniker came from his rejection of Christianity.

The father of Echepolus shared his name with this son of Capys and Themiste or Hieromneme.  His first daughter-in-law shared her name with a daughter of Erechtheus who was the mother of Ion, Achaeus and Dorus.  He traveled with Antenor to demand the return of his cousin Hesione, and secretly bred his mares with the immortal horses of his uncle Laomedon.  His son was the result of a dalliance with a goddess disguised as a Phrygian princess, who later saved him by using her girdle to divert a thunderbolt thrown at him after he boasted about the affair.  This made him lame, so he had to be carried away from Troy on his son's shoulders.  FTP, name this mortal lover of Aphrodite, the father of Aeneas.

answer: {Griswold} v. {Connecticut}

In order to find that the plaintiffs had standing, the majority opinion distinguished this case from Tiletson v. Ullman. The majority also "declined the invitation" that Lochner "be our guide," while Justice Brennan joined a concurring opinion that favorably cited Harlan's dissent in Poe v. Ullman. That concurrence was written by Justice Goldberg, who noted that "the concept of liberty protects those personal right that are fundamental," and rested his argument on the 9th. Representing the first use of William Douglas' "penumbral" reasoning, the principles established in this case were later extended by Eisenstadt v. Baird, and this case is famous for Justice Stewart's dissent, in which called the law in question "uncommonly silly." FTP, identify this 1965 case concerning contraceptive distribution to married couples.

Tom Baker authored an article “on the genealogy of” this economic concept. Roland Maude-Griffin and John Nyman have written a paper on the welfare effects of it in a belated response to a work by Mark Pauly on the economics of this. First coined by Kenneth Arrow, this term arises in international law in the case of odious debt where loans give incentives to foster corrupt regimes, but the classic case of this phenomenon deals with health insurance, the possession of which may inefficiently affect how patients make use of medical services. FTP give the economic term for the irresponsible behavior people tend to exhibit when all risk is transferred away from them.

This explorer established a trading post in Calicut on the Malabar Coast, but it was attacked by a band of Muslims, and he was forced to return and bombard the post. Earlier in that same journey, he had sailed into Porto Seguro and after spotting Mount Pascoal, he dubbed his discovery Vera Cruz, a holy appellation in honor of it being Easter. He returned and was received by Manuel I, but mysteriously never again sailed. Some argue that his major find merely confirmed a discovery of Amerigo Vespucci, but in any case it was quickly renamed for the red dye-producing wood discovered there.

answer: {bottleneck} effect (accept {population bottleneck}, {genetic bottleneck}, or {variations})

Animals that show evidence of this include European bisons and northern elephant seals, and it is thought to have occurred in giant pandas about 43,000 years ago.  Because of this effect, skin grafts from one cheetah to another do not create an immune response.  A variant that occurs when a small group separates from the rest of a population, resulting in increased genetic drift and inbreeding, is called the founder effect.  FTP, name this evolutionary event in which a significant percentage of the population or species is killed or unable to reproduce, resulting in a population reduction of 50% or more.
