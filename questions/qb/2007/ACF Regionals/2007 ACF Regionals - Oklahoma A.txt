answer: Battle of {Stamford Bridge}

Prior to this battle, one commander sent a message for reinforcements to Eystein Orre, but he arrived very late, shortly before the entire army's retreat to Riccall. The victorious commander stopped at Helmsley and plotted his attack on a relaxed and unready army situated along the Derwent river. The clash came after the Battle of Fulford, which had seen the defeat of Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria. A legend holds that the victors were successful only after spearing a “monstrous giant,” and thus defeated the armies of Tostig, the exiled earl of Northumberland, and Harald Hardrada. FTP, name this 1066 CE victory for Harold of England immediately before Hastings, named for a certain structure.

answer: {Zeeman} Effect

The occurrence of this effect in atmospheric molecular oxygen is the dominant cause of polarized atmospheric emissions around 60 GHz. The Lyman-alpha transition is a manifestation of this effect, and the energies associated with one form of it can be written as being proportional to the Lande g-factor. This effect obeys selection rules which permit a change in orbital quantum number by plus or minus one, and a change in the magnetic quantum number by either zero or plus or minus one. Its strong-field form is known as the Paschen-Back effect, and its weak-field, or anomalous form was the first to be discovered by its namesake. FTP, identify this effect in which degenerate energy levels of an atom are split by a magnetic field.

Several references are made to Daedalus and his skilled artwork, capable of making materials move on their own. It begins by asking Socrates why he has left the Lyceum and come to the “Porch of the King Archon,” where the title character has himself come to lay charges of murder against his father.

answer: {Aldosterone}

Antagonists of this compound include amphenone and spironolactone, which can be used to treat its overproduction, known as Conn's syndrome.  Atrial natriuretic factor suppresses this compound's release and inhibits the release of renin, which is involved in a feedback system with this compound and angiotensin II.  Following its release from the zona glomerulosa it stimulates ion pumps in the capillaries surrounding the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys, resulting in increased excretion of potassium ions and increased blood pressure and volume.  FTP, what is this mineralocorticoid which increases reabsorption of water and sodium ions from filtrate?

This man was the subject of praise in George Orwell's 1940 essay Inside the Whale, in which Orwell also praised this man's Black Spring. A 1949 novel by this man landed Maurice Girodias in trouble and was the first in a series of works whose plot leads up to his divorce from his wife June. In one of his novels, he appears as a narrator who acquires a job with the Cosmodemonic Telegraph Company, while a more famous novel begins with the lines, "We live at the Villa Borghese and we are all dead." Inspired by his travels in the United States in the early 1940s to write The Air Conditioned Nightmare, for ten points, identify this author of the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy as well as Tropic of Capricorn and Tropic of Cancer.

answer: Franklin {Pierce}

In his inaugural address, this man noted that "the great scheme of our constitutional liberty rests upon a proper distribution of power between the State and Federal authorities." He made Caleb Cushing his attorney general, and appointed only one Supreme Court Justice, John Campbell. His administration's foreign policy mistakes included recognizing William Walker's filibuster government in Nicaragua as well as having his Secretary of State William Marcy wind up on the receiving end of the Ostend Manifesto. This man's nomination was the result of deadlock between Lewis Cass, Stephen Douglas, and James Buchanan, and his cabinet included Jefferson Davis as Secretary of War. For ten points, identify this man, nicknamed "Young Hickory" for his ardent Jacksonianism, a Democrat who was elected President in 1852.

answer: {Gibbs} phase rule (prompt {Gibbs})

Chesworth and Dejou applied this simple equation to work in soil chemistry, as a basis for the Hume-Rothery rules. It can be extended to flow systems with the introduction of feed streams and extensive variables, and is sometimes used in conjunction with DePriester charts to tabulate data. It can be quickly transformed into Euler's formula for simple polyhedra and arises out of an equation of its namesake and Duhem. Its mathematical formulation for a system at equilibrium equates the number of components plus 2 to the degrees of freedom plus the number of distinct states. FTP, name this basic rule of thermodynamics named for a guy who also has a certain free energy.

Juan de Urtubia led the sacking of this city by the Navarrese Company 68 years after it was captured by the Catalan Company following the battle of Halmyros.

Cassander repaired the damage this city suffered following its unsuccessful revolt against the League of Corinth, which came 3 years after its defeat alongside Athens at Chaeronea.

The foremost study on this affliction was authored by Herbert Schreir and Judith Libow, in a book that analyzes the case of “Christopher.” Catherine Ayoub has written about its proper separation into two components, the PCF and FDP elements, and their respective psychologies. It was first proposed by Roy Meadow of Leeds University in an article in The Lancet in 1977, years after Richard Asher had given the name to a related condition. Groups like M.A.M.A. have coalesced to question its legitimacy, and it is sometimes known as FII. FTP, name this psychological disorder in which a person causes illness in another person under their care in order to fulfill emotional needs, thus acting as the namesake proxy.
