answer: “{Dejection}: An Ode”

The final version of this poem addresses a Lady, while previous versions had addressed Edmund, William, and Sara.  Its first stanza mentions the “New-moon winter-bright,” an allusion to the epigraph from the “Ballad of Sir Patrick Spence.”  Its line “still I gaze—and with how blank an eye!” is characteristic of its author's concern over his disengagement from his perceptions, a theme prompted by hearing his friend's Ode: Intimations of Immortality.  The seventh stanza opens with the line “Hence, viper thoughts, that coil around my mind” in, FTP, this Coleridge poem describing “a grief without a pang, void, dark, and drear.”

answer: {New Economic} Policy ({NEP})

Before the introduction of this program, a commission known as Gosplan was created for coordination. Some historians have suggested that it was formulated years earlier than its implementation in an essay entitled “Six Theses on the Immediate Tasks.” It created an imbalance in wealth that led to the so-called Scissors Crisis, and it shares its name with an unrelated policy adopted by Malaysia in 1971. Much of the impetus for it came in the Kronstadt Rebellion, which demanded an end to War Communism, but it was itself abandoned after the Grain Crisis of 1928 by Stalin. FTP, name this program launched in 1921 to transform the Soviet economy.

answer: {irreducibility} (accept word forms)

Algebraic varieties have this property if they cannot be written as the union of other nonempty algebraic varieties. Individual elements of an integral domain have this property if they are not units, and this property holds when a prime number doesn't divide the first coefficient of a polynomial but does divide the rest, a condition known as Eisenstein's criterion. The pth cyclotomic polynomial always has this property for any prime number p, and if this property is not true over the rational numbers, it will not be true over the integers. For polynomials of degree two or three, this property will hold if and only if the polynomial has a zero. FTP, identify this property of polynomials, which states that any time the polynomial can be factored, one of the factors is a unit.

answer: {Angle} of {Repose}

Many of the characters in this work have connections to U.C. Berkeley, including Shelley, who has dropped out of Berkeley and has a fight with Ada about who will get to give a bath. This work was based partially on the papers of Mary Hallock Foote, which its author helped to acquire while professor at Stanford. Events in this work include the drowning of Agnes as well as the suicide of Frank Sargent, and the main character spends much of his time perusing the letters from his grandmother, Susan Ward, to her friend Augusta while being confined to a wheelchair after having his leg amputated. For ten points, identify this novel containing the reminiscences of Lyman Ward, written by Wallace Stegner.

answer: {microcredit} (or {microloans} or {microfinance})

One of the first recognized implementations of this policy came with an organization founded by Al Whittaker and David Bussau, and according to an article in The Economist, its first beneficiary was Carlos Moreno in 1974. Projects like Zopa's and Prosper seek to extend this basic idea to private action in developed nations. A summit dedicated to its furtherance was convened in 1997, and a second last November in Halifax. A development that won Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank a Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, FTP, give the term used to describe this idea of extending very small loans to particularly the poor and unemployed.

answer: the {Nazarene} movement (or the Brotherhood of St. Luke before it's mentioned)

Among this group's aims was the revival of monumental fresco painting, and one of its main patrons was the Marquis Massimo, whose Casino near the Lateran was the site of one of its major commissions. Among works produced by one its adherents is the tempera fresco Joseph Interpreting Pharaoh's Dream, while another created The Triumph of Religion in Art. Initially working out of the abandoned monastery of San Isidoro, this group's main commission was the Casa Bartholdi. They included the designer of the Munich Glyptothek, Peter Cornelius, whose Last Judgement covers the entire east wall in Munich's Ludwigskirche. Founded as the Brotherhood of St. Luke, FTP, identify this group of religious German painters including Friedrich Overbeck and Friedrich Schadow.

answer: {amine} (accept {amino group})

This functional group is the product of the Petasis reaction, which combines a carbonyl compound with one of these to create a more complicated one. The Kabachnik-Fields reaction combines one of these with a carbonyl and a hydro-phosphoryl in a reaction that is often the first step in creating peptidomimetic compounds. The Mannich reaction creates a secondary or tertiary one, while the product of the Strecker synthesis includes one of these and a carboxylic acid.  Often created by the reaction of an imine and sodium cyano-borohydride, this is, FTP, what functional group that consists of three hydrogen or carbon atoms singly bonded to one nitrogen atom?

answer: {Lena} River

A portion of this river contains some unique paleo-geological formations known as its “pillars,” steep cliffs composed of Kimberly limestone which have yielded archaeological finds. It receives the Linde River on the east, but a far more prominent tributary is the Aldan River on the west. Its vast delta of over 150 branches connects to Tiksi Bay, after this river completes its course through the Sakha Republic including the lone major city on its banks, Yakutsk, and then proceeds to empty into the Laptev Sea. Rising in the mountains surrounding Lake Baikal, FTP, name this tenth largest river in the world which flows north through western Russia.

answer: {Averroes} or {Ibn Rushd}

In one work, this thinker concludes that if people like doctors and lawyers are capable of extrapolation, then religious thinkers are “surely able to do even better in that regard.” That writing has been recently translated together with an Epistle Dedicatory and labeled as this man's Decisive Treatise. His other important ideas include the concept of an acquired intellect, which requires communication with active intellect, and his propagation of the idea of the “double truth.” He composed some Generalities and Particularities on medical subjects, and wrote a work in response to al-Ghazali, The Incoherence of the Incoherence. FTP, identify this medieval Islamic philosopher who wrote commentaries on Aristotle.

Soon after its last ruler was assassinated by one of his generals, that general faced an invasion led by the Bactrian King Demetrius I. The Greeks referred to one of its rulers as Amitrochates, and to his father as Sandrocottos. Sandrocottos was a party to the treaty known as the Epigamia and gave 500 elephants, which proved very useful at Ipsus, to Seleucus I. It was followed by the Sunga dynasty and preceded by the Nanda dynasty. Its emperors included the victor at the battle of Kalinga, and his father Bindusara.

Species in this phylum with thin laminae are termed illoricate, and members of this phylum exhibit 9 different morphologies of trophi, small jaws that line the pharynx. Parthenogenesis and the ability to survive desiccation through cryptobiosis characterize class Bdelloidea [dell-OY-dia]. The namesake feature of these pseudocoelomates [soo-doh-SEE-lum-ates] is used for propulsion and for sending food past the trophi by generating a vortex of water. FTP, name this invertebrate phylum characterized by a corona of cilia whose beating led Leeuwenhoek to call them “wheel animalcules.”

answer: {Gustavus Adolphus} of Sweden ({Gustav II Adolf})

This ruler, the subject of a biography by Michael Roberts, signed the Treaty of Barwalde that contained an unusual provision placing a five-year moratorium on peace negotiations. Over 20 years into his reign, he developed the Form of Government that helped create the Gymnasia and set out plans to create leagues designated as Corpus Bellicum and Corpus Evangelicorum. He negotiated the Treaty of Knared with Christian IV, surrendering a port as security, and used the name Captain Gars in travel. With aid from his chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, he was victorious at the Battle of Breitenfeld but soon died at the Battle of Lutzen. FTP, name this “Lion of the North,” a dominant king of Sweden at the start of the Thirty Years War.

answer: {phonons}

Their interactions typically proceed along two modes, the so-called “normal” processes and the “U” or Umklapp processes. Their dispersion relation give rises to branches known as acoustical and optical, and the Mossbauer effect occurs when an object recoils without emitting one of these. They obey Bose-Einstein statistics and obey the periodicity conditions set by Brillouin zones. Treating these particles as analogous to waves yields a quantity called the crystal momentum, and they explain such properties of solids as electrical and thermal conductivity. For ten points, identify these pseudo-particles, which represent the quantizations of lattice vibrations.

answer: {Brandenburg} concertos

Michael Marissen argues that this work's use of major mode keys of the soft hexachord was intended to complement L'Estro Armonico.  Its composer's Sinfonia in F Major is an early version of its first portion lacking the third movement and the polonaise of the fourth movement.  A lengthy solo passage for harpsichord caps the first movement of one piece, and another has two fast movements separated by two slow chords. The third of these works divides the orchestra into three parts, while the second features solo violin, flute, oboe and trumpet. Catalogued as BWV 1046-1051, FTP name this collection of six instrumental pieces by Bach, named for a Margrave.

This man is described as “a being darkly wise and rudely great” in the subtitle of a book about him by Ralph Korngold. First elected on an anti-Masonic platform in 1833, he derived most of his influence from chairmanship of both the Ways and Means Committee and the Appropriations Committee. A strong supporter of the Morill Tariff, he helped push through the first Confiscation Act and was one of only four representatives to vote against the Crittenden-Johnson resolution. He is more famous for beginning the impeachment proceedings against Andrew Johnson, as well as for helping to draft both the 14th Amendment and the Reconstruction Act.

In his book Shaping a Nation, Carter Wiseman writes that an important feature of its design was introduced to “relieve the... monotony of a smooth facade.” Its main architect himself noted that new structural principles can be seen most clearly “when we use glass in place of the outer walls;” consequently, this building is notable for its tinted windows, as well as blinds that can only be in three positions. It's also famous for a bronze curtain wall, and sits across Park Avenue from the Lever House, another building designed in the International Style.
