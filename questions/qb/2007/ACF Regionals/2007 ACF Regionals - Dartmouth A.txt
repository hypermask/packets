answer: Clifford James {Geertz}

This man discusses “essentialism and epochalism” and the “four phases of nationalism” in his somewhat uncharacteristic essay entitled “After the Revolution.” His satirically-titled lecture “Anti-Anti-Relativism” paradoxically concludes that provincialism is a greater danger than relativism. More substantial works of his include the rather recent Available Light and a comparative study Islam Observed. He discusses the swidden and sabah procedures in Agricultural Involution, but is most famous for a work with chapters on “The Politics of Meaning” and “Deep Play,” in which he presents notes on a Balinese cockfight with “thick description.” FTP, name this American anthropologist best known for The Interpretation of Cultures.

answer: ({Sardinia})-{Piedmont} (accept {Savoy} before mentioned)

A constitution named for this region was promulgated in 1848 and renewed by its neighbors in 1860, and the so-called day of this region corresponds to the 1748 Battle of Assietta. In Napoleonic times, it became the site of the Subalpine Republic as well as the annexed Republic of Alba. The region was given to Duke Emmanuel Philibert by the terms of Cateau-Cambresís in 1559, along with Savoy, and he immediately moved the seat of government away from Chambéry. The Congress of Vienna restored the King of Sardinia, and rulers like Victor Emmanuel II took the title of prince of this region. FTP, name this Italian region centered at Turin whose name indicates a position at the foot of a mountain.

answer: {Georg Büchner}

Dorothy James wrote of the "Interesting Case" of this man's most famous play, and As You Like It and Clemens Brentano's Ponce de Leon inspired one of his plays set in the Kingdom of Popo. In another of his plays, the title character is tempted back into politics by Camille Desmoulins, though he prefers to flirt with the prostitute Marion, and is eventually executed by the orders of the Committee of Public Safety. More famously, he authored the liberal tract The Hessian Messenger and wrote of a man who drowns after killing Marie when he sees her at a fair with a Drum Major. For ten points, identify this playwright of Leonce and Lena and Danton's Death, whose play Woyzeck was made into an opera by Alban Berg.

In a comic scene in this work, a maid disguised as a doctor produces a huge magnet and pretends to cure two men, intoning “Questo e quel pezzo.”  The talents of Adriana Gabrielli, who had recently become the librettist's mistress, induced its composer to write challenging skips and an astonishing range into the aria “Come scoglio.”  This opera's action is spurred by a wager of one hundred sequins between the cynical Don Alfonso and the officers Ferrando and Guglielmo, who have misplaced faith in the sisters Dorabella and Fiordiligi.  FTP name this light opera with libretto by da Ponte and composed by Mozart whose title translates roughly as “Women are like that.”

answer: {Boron}

The Miyaura Reaction specifically involves synthesis of compounds with this element, and Suzuki coupling occurs between halides and organic acids of this element. One organic reaction involving this element was partly developed by Herbert Brown and is a two-step reaction which often uses the solvent THF. It proceeds in an anti-Markovnikov fashion in which the compound containing this element adds across the double bond, producing an alcohol after the second step of oxidation. Originally discovered by Humphrey Davy, FTP, name this element which has one electron in its 2p shell, thus making its atomic number 5.

One side in this conflict employed the field fortress design expertise of Belaieff and Ern.  The other side purchased several Vickers 143 aircraft and tanks, but the sweltering heat forced the tanks to operate with all hatches open, rendering them easy targets for grenades.  Kundt had initial command of the army of a nation still smarting from the loss of its Litoral Province in a previous conflict in the 1880s.  That nation saw a coup replace Salamanca with Tejada Sorzano after a string of victories by Estegarribia.  Saavedra Lamas helped secure a 1935 armistice in, FTP, this war fought over a prime piece of real estate ranging from waterless plains to arid thornbrush jungle, contested by Paraguay and Bolivia.

One work of philosophy titled after this idea begins by discussing the difference between men and animals, saying that an elephant is no smarter than a dog, and has 27 sections in two parts, with an introduction that is also included in its author's collection, The Fiery Brook. Miguel de Unamuno wrote about the agony of this in a book translated by Anthony Kerrigan. Another work concerning it presents “Dialogues between a Conservative and an Innovator” and ends with an invocation to princes. John Locke wrote about the reasonableness of it and the above-mentioned work is that by Ludwig Feuerbach on the essence of it. FTP, Saint-Simon put forth a new type of this idea, a certain belief system that likes Jesus an awful lot.

He noted that "the poet and the priest were united originally in the same person" in his lecture "The Function of the Poet," and referred to the title concept as "the wings of the mind" in "Imagination." This man's memorial poems include ones written for Kossuth and Lamartine, as well as one on William Garrison. Poems about "The Shepherd of King Admetus" and "Hebe" are included in one of his collections, whose title character requests "golden spurs" to search for the Holy Grail, The Vision of Sir Launfal. Phoebus and Daphne appear in his satirical Fable For Critics, and the namesake farmer, Ezequiel, appears in an 1846 publication opposing the Mexican-American War. For ten points, identify this American poet of the Biglow Papers.

He sold the killer of Iphitus into slavery and tried to give Iphitus's children the money he received for his half-brother from the purchaser, Omphale.  One of his sons was honored with a cenotaph in the hippodrome at Olympia built by Pelops.  After Hyrieus housed this character and his father, he helped Hyrieus create Orion.  His sons include Myrtilus, Eos's beloved Cephalus, and Anticlea's father Autolychus.  This psychopomp invented gymnastics, boxing, astronomy, and weights and measures.

answer: Charles Stewart {Parnell}

This man set off on a celebrated mission to America with John Dillon, but once he returned was forced to negotiate the so-called “treaty that never was,” the Kilmainham Treaty. His stature rose in the wake of the New Departure campaign, and he set out to continue the quest of his predecessor Isaac Butt. Sometimes dubbed the “uncrowned king,” he became troubled by the forgery of Richard Piggott, which linked him to the Invincibles and the Pheonix Park murders. He'd earlier encouraged the issuance of the No Rent Manifesto as president of the Land League, but may be better remembered for his career-breaking affair with Kitty O'Shea. FTP, name this 19th century nationalist politician who advocated Irish home rule.

This man wrote two poems in sets of strophe, antistrophe and epode: “The Bard” and “The Progress of Poesy.”  He declined to be “rat catcher to his Majesty,” as he termed the poet laureateship, on the death of Colly Cibber.  One of his poems speaks of “antique towers” in the title locale, before concluding of the occupants that “Thought would destroy their paradise.”  Another poem opens as “The plowman homeward plods his weary way / And leaves the world to darkness and to me.”  FTP, name this poet of an “Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College” who noted that “Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest” in his “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.”

answer: {Hamiltonian}

Mathematically, this role can be played by any smooth, real-valued function on a symplectic manifold, and those quantities whose Poisson bracket with it is zero are conserved over time. In quantum mechanics, when a non-trivial unitary operator commutes with this quantity, degeneracy will occur, and this quantity can also be written as "minus i times h-bar times the partial derivative with respect to time of the wave function." Appearing in the Schrodinger equation for finding eigenstates and obtained by a Legendre transform from the Lagrangian, for ten points, identify this physical quantity which represents a system's total energy.

This man is the namesake of an apocryphal epistle, which in the Roman canon is appended as the sixth chapter as the book of Baruch. Baruch is also believed to be the author of the second part of this man's namesake book, who received his prophetic call in the 13th century of King Josiah. His book's 52nd chapter is a historical appendix largely taken from 2nd Kings, while chapters 7 and 26 contain his famous "Temple sermon." This man preached during the reign of King Jehoiakim and King Zedekiah, the last king of Judah and his book also contains a set of his confessions. For ten points, identy this prophet, who saw the destruction of the Temple and the razing of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and whose book is followed in the Old Testament by his Lamentations.

This man was dispatched, along with Sentius Saturninus, to attack king Maroboduus of the Marcomanni.  He retained the astrologer Thrasyllus after a correct prediction of good news from the ship that brought word he could return to Rome.  He crowned Tigranes of Armenia, and delayed celebrating his triumph over the Pannonians during the mourning for Varrus's disaster.  Suetonius states that he had trained young boys nibble between his legs when he went swimming, one of many debaucheries he supposedly indulged in after he retired to Capri, leaving Sejanus in charge.

Dominant mutations described by this prefix often involve genes that encode diffusible factors, such as the wild-type lacI+ gene.  Monocistronic mRNAs are produced from polycistronic primary transcripts in trypanosomes by this type of splicing, which combines a short leader exon and any of several independent coding exons.  For most peptides this planar form is about 1000 times more stable than the alternative, unless the second residue is proline, in which case it is only about 4 times more stable.  As a result, in most native proteins the C O and N H groups point in opposite directions, as indicated by, FTP, what configurational prefix contrasted with cis?

Linguists famed for their work with this language include Martin Haase, who wrote on its unique tense and aspect, and the recently deceased Larry Trask, who wrote a history of it and was widely regarded as its foremost expert. An ergative-absolutive language, it encompasses six main dialects and its verb agreement system is uniquely polypersonal. It has been connected to the theoretical Dene-Caucasian family as well as the Vasconic languages, but these links are only tentative. Also known as euskara, FTP, name this language classified in an isolated family of its own and spoken by people of the namesake autonomous community in the Pyrenees and northern Spain.

This man was the primary target of Jeremy Collier's A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage, attitudes to which this man contributed with his plays The Relapse and The Provok'd Wife. His first commission in his better-known field was for Lord Carlisle, and he was notable for reviving a style known as the "colossal order." He adopted a simpler style in his design of Kimbolton Castle, and late in life he completed Seton Delaval Hall without the aid of his most famous partner. However, he is best known for a work which followed his Opera House in the Haymarket and which was designed together with Nicholas Hawksmoor to commemorate a famous victory. For ten points, identify this British architect, most famous for his design of John Churchill's Blenheim Palace.

Roger Storms wrote a definitive 1972 history of this organization entitled Partisan Prophets, and in 1977 it changed its name to the National Statesman Party. Susanna Salter became the first woman mayor in the United States on this party's ticket in 1887, and it also elected Sidney Catts as Florida governor in 1916. This party nominated Earl Dodge five times for the Presidency, and one of its notable campaigns included renting a train known as their namesake "special" in which John Wooley and Henry Metcalf traveled over 23,000 miles while running on the "canteen" issue. Its greatest success was followed shortly thereafter by the Volstead Act, which authorized the enforcement of a 1919 piece of legislation. For ten points, identify this American third party whose main platform involved forbidding alcohol production.

After meeting his future wife, he thinks of her metaphorically as a child floating down a river, and notes that "a single metaphor can give birth to love." That wife also clings to this man compulsively in her sleep, and he formulates a "rule of three" for seeing his mistresses, either seeing them thrice and never again, or once every three weeks. One of his mistresses, Sabina, later becomes a successful artist in America, while this man and his wife Tereza are killed when their truck flies off the road. For ten points, identify this protagonist of Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being.
