answer: {Watts riots}

This event inspired the Frank Zappa song "Trouble Every Day," and was the subject of an essay published in the 10th volume of the Situationist International, "The Decline and Fall of the Spectacle-Commodity Economy." The McCone commission was later appointed to investigate its causes, one of which was the enactment of Proposition 14, and its location is home to a famous construction by Simon Rodia. Its immediate trigger was the arrest of Marquette Frye, who was pulled over for drunk driving on August 11th, which sparked tensions already in place due to a law that counteracted the fair housing portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. For ten points, identify this 1965 riot in a black neighborhood of Los Angeles.

answer: {Washington Square}

In writing about this novel, its author noted that "the only good thing about the story is the girl," and that girl, much to another character's chagrin, purchases a red stain gown trimmed with gold fringe on her 20th birthday. That character, Austin, also notes with disappointment that Mrs. Almond's daughter has married "very punctually," and later visits Mrs. Montogomery, who admits that her brother is lazy and has spent his savings. Lavinia Penniman's overactive imagination initially aids the suit of a man first encountered at a stockbroker's party, but Dr. Sloper's opinion of that man as a "deluded fortune hunter" and Catherine's own willingness to give up her inheritance drive away Morris Townsend. For ten points, identify this Henry James novel, named for the New York neighborhood where the Slopers reside.

answer: The {Origins} of {Totalitarianism}

In the “Concluding Remarks” to this work, the author writes of the creation of a system where all men are equally superfluous. Another section credits Hobbes' Leviathan with describing a “reckoning of the consequences that follow from the rise of a new class in society whose existence is essentially tied up with property.” That section, entitled “The Political Emancipation of the Bourgeoisie,” ends by discussing the Dreyfus affair, after which the author talks of the “annihilation of action.” Originally entitled “The Three Pillars of Hell,” its third and final section includes a chapter on “ideology and terror,” a “novel form of government,” after the prior two volumes focused on imperialism and anti-Semitism. FTP, name this 1951 book by Hannah Arendt, about how governments like Nazi Germany come to power.

answer: Cardinal {Richelieu} (or {Armand Jean du Plessis} de {Richelieu})

Probably the most comprehensive study of this historical figure is the 1967 three-volume work of Carl Burckhardt. This man undertook what he called “the reformation of the third order of the realm” in his political testament, but at first he was forced to flee to Blois in the wake of the murder of Concino Concini. He established the Company of One Hundred Associates, and an attempt to eliminate him was known as the Day of the Dupes. He'd gain plenty of enemies later in his career like Gaston of Orleans and the marquis de Cinq-Mars. Succeeded by Mazarin, FTP, name this chief minister to Louis XIII starting in 1624, a cardinal known as the “Red Eminence.”

answer: Henry's Law

In the limit of low pressure and coverage, this relation can be derived from Hirasaki's model. Solid-phase microextraction techniques have been used to determine its constants, two of which are dimensionless, and the rest of which must be converted between units, while their reciprocal is the water partition coefficient. Its application to the solvent is a special case which falls under Raoult's Law, and it assumes dilute ideal solutions. Most simply stated as P equals KC, it holds that the concentration of a solute gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution. The cause of decompression sickness, FTP, give this gas law named for an English chemist.

This nation includes the historic Solentiname Archipelago as well as Ometepe Island, and it has national parks on Zapatera Island and surrounding its Mombacho volcano. Its borders are defined largely by rivers, the Coco River in the north and the San Juan in the south. Its major port city, on the Escondido River, is Bluefields, and other sizeable cities include Rivas, León, and Chinandega. Another important river in this nation is the Tipitapa, not so much for its length, but for its role in connecting the two large bodies of water within the country. Containing the province of Zelaya, FTP, name this largest Central American country situated between Costa Rica and Honduras.

answer: {Edward} the {Confessor}

In the year of his crowning he seized a treasure from his mother, Emma, convinced that she still sympathized with the Danes who had driven him from the monastery of Ely when he was a child. He punished the residents of Dover for rioting against his brother-in-law Eustace of Boulogne and installed Robert of Jumieges as Archbishop of Canterbury. These moves by this Norman-educated king raised the suspicions of his aristocratic opponents, the earls Leofric of Mercia, Siward of Northumbria, and Godwin of Wessex. FTP, name this penultimate Anglo-Saxon king of England, who ruled from 1043 to 1066 and was canonized a century later.

A reading of Spinoza is central to this author's short story "In the Basement," while a story by the titular author, "The Confession," is read by one of the characters in his "Guy de Maupassant." This author's most famous work contains a story in which the nameless narrator, a propaganda officer, kills the titular animal. In addition to "My First Goose," that work also includes "Crossing into Poland," and this man is well-known for creating the character of the Jewish gangster Benya Krik in the short story "The King," which is part of his cycle set in his native city, the Odessa Stories. For ten points, identify this Jewish writer who died in a gulag in 1941 and is best known for his collection Red Cavalry.

answer: The {Nicene Creed} (or {Niceno}-{Constantinopolitan Creed})

A later version of this document was approved at the same time as a Tome and two notable letters, and the discussion which led to its approval included a debate over the word "homousios." The question of whether a word was written with one or two instances of the letter "nu" is important to its interpretation, and it was accepted by Damasus I after being promulgated at a meeting which established trinitarianism. The "filioque" clause of this document has been rejected by the Eastern churches, and it ends by stating that "we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come." For ten points, identify this profession of faith, deceptively not issued by a namesake 325 C.E. council.

One of these which performs an important action only when writing data to disk is used in the Reiser4 file system and is known as a dancing one. The Day-Stout-Warren algorithm runs in linear time when operating on these objects, of which the radix variety is used to store sets of strings. The tasks of spatial searching and the storage of database information usually use the R and B varieties respectively, while types known as scapegoat, splay, red-black, and AVL are all self-balancing and binary. For ten points, identify these directed acyclic graphs, a type of data structure which consists of nodes that each have one parent and possibly many children.

One of his operas includes the arias "With my mother" and "How strange and dead," as well as a furiant dance and "The Dance of the Comedians."  His orchestral works include the Triumphal Symphony, the Festive Symphony, and a collection of symphonic tone poems, including one that opens with paired flutes depicting two springs.  He said that the finale of a string quartet "includes a long-drawn out note, the fatal whistling" meant to symbolize his syphilis-induced deafness.

In one story in this collection, one character kills a young deer while another watches a fourteen-point buck walk by without shooting it. In another, a man is entrusted with an envelope full of money and told to say "No" to the messenger who will come to collect it. That messenger, in the story "Delta Autumn," is a woman who bore Roth's son, for whom the main character gives the woman his hunting horn. In the title story, Samuel's body is brought back from Illinois through the arrangements of Gavin Stevens.  Other stories in this collection include "Pantaloon in Black" and "The Fire and the Hearth."

Usually included in this man's collected works are his letters to Count Toreno on a common subject. He proposed a choice between conflicting Christian religions in “Not Paul, but Jesus,” a work written under the name Gamaliel Smith and edited by Francis Place. He discussed certain Anarchical Fallacies in a work by that name, and hired Edwin Chadwick as a secretary late in life, long after more adventurous works like Auto-Icon; Or, Farther Uses of the Dead to the Living and his treatise on education Chrestomathia. He's better known for proposing pain and pleasure as sovereign masters of the body in Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation.

One class in this phylum is distinguished by its posterior-end opisthaptor, a second class has an anterior-end scolex, and a third class has sub-epidermal rhabdites.  They contain filling tissue known as parenchyma, and some species have photoreceptors known as ocelli.  Some species of this phylum engage in penis fencing, while cross-fertilization and transverse fission are common in the cestodes and the free-living turbellaria, respectively.  These triploblastic acoelomates are unsegmented and bilaterally symmetric.  Flukes and tapeworms can be found in, FTP, this phylum of flatworms.

Near this work's end, we hear of a count of known munificence.  The title character's “spot of joy” was a “faint half flush that [died] along her throat,” but in an ominous moment the speaker states, “I gave commands; / Then all smiles stopped together.”  The speaker mentions his “nine-hundred-years-old name” and points out a bronze sculpture of a sea-horse being tamed by Neptune.  “A heart…too soon made glad” is considered a failing of the title character, whose likeness is preserved in a painting by Frà Pandolf.

This man appointed British citizen Bob Astles, known as the “white rat,” as a special anti-corruption advisor. Upon his assent to power, he renamed his government house the Command Post, and replaced the old GSU with the SRB, headquartered at Nakasero. Likely responsible for the death of Pierino Okoya, he exiled all Asians from his country including the Indian and Pakistani businessmen, and attacked the Acholi and Langi peoples. His country would come to be ruled by Yoweri Museveni, who played a role in unseating him, but his reign was actually book-ended by Milton Obote.

Not long after this artist turned to illustrating historical novels, his son died, which led to the loss of this man's pension and the creation of the works for which he is now most famous. In writing about his own work, this artist claimed that only at 73 did he "finally comprehend something of the true quality of birds," and that at 110, "each line shall surely possess a life of its own." His earlier works include two collections of Festivals as well as a depiction of foreigners observing the customs of his country, but he is most famous for a collection of which one drawing inspired Rilke's poem Der Berg, as well as his namesake manga.

answer: {antiferromagnetism}

Since this phenomenon occurs when the separation scale is on the order of about 4 angstroms, it displays the limitations of the Bethe-Slater curve, which predicts the opposite behavior. Like a similar phenomenon, its susceptibility curve is non-differentiable at a critical point, at which a spontaneous sublattice moment develops. This phenomenon is exploited in the exchange bias technique, and the susceptibility of materials that exhibiting it behaves according to the Curie-Weiss law in the paramagnetic regime. For ten points, identify this behavior which disappears above the Neel point, and in which neighboring magnetic domains align with spins pointed in opposite, rather than the same, directions.

answer: Treaty of {Fort Laramie}

Pierre de Smet was a key figure in the negotiation of the first treaty of this name, during which Mitchell and Fitzpatrick offered $50,000 in goods was offered to one side, though Congress later reneged on that promise. Another agreement of this name required one of the agreeing parties to send their children to school, and marked the area north of the North Platte as being off limits to settlers. Crazy Horse refused to honor the provisions of the second treaty of this name, which had resulted in the abandonment of the fortifications of the Bozeman trail, but the discovery of gold in the Black Hills led to its repeated violation. Named for the Wyoming town in which they were signed, for ten points, identify these two treaties of 1851 and 1868, the second of which confined Red Cloud and the Oglala Sioux to a Nebraskan reservation.
