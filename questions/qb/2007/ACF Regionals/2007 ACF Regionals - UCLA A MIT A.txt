answer: {sample}; accept "{sampling}" and "{sample size}"

For relative precision, its effective value is the coefficient of variation, while for population means, it is Z sigma squared over allowable difference squared.  The model-based approach to obtaining it uses an unbiased predictor Z hat whose variance is a correction factor times the distribution variance over n for a mean estimator. Its namesake proportion is the fraction of successes of Bernoulli trials, and its space is the largest set in the sigma-algebra formed by the set of all possible events for a random variate. The finite population Central Limit theorem applies when its size goes to infinity.  Markov chain Monte Carlo and simple random techniques are used to obtain, for ten points, what selection from a population that forms the basis of surveys?
