answer: {Giffen} good (prompt {inferior goods})

They may cease to exist in a Markowitz model, although rational actors can introduce them in more complicated scenarios. When they are injected into the Slutsky Equation, the result is a uniquely negative semidefinite symmetry. Alfred Marshall devoted approximately ten lines of his Principles of Economics to them originally, and Uriel Spingel argued that public transportation was one. They clearly differ from the Veblen type, which factor in conspicuous consumption, and two Harvard economists have made the case for rice and noodles being ones in parts of China. FTP, name these theoretical inferior goods most famously exemplified by potatoes during the Irish potato famine.

answer: Battle of {Eutaw Springs}

Much of this battle was fought for control of a brick house, and in its aftermath John Coffin's cavalry was unable to pursue the retreating attackers. Isaac Allen's New Jersey volunteers and John Cruger's battalion of DeLancey's Brigade faded in the initial attack. When the attackers paused to loot the camp, they were picked off by Henry Sheridan's New York volunteers and routed by a battalion led by John Marjoribanks. Following the loss of Fort Ninety-Six, Alexander Stewart had stopped his army to gather provisions, at which point they were attacked on September 8th, 1781, by a force under Nathanael Greene.  Technically a loss for Continental forces, FTP name this battle of the American Revolution which took place outside of Charleston, South Carolina.

answer: {Deirdre} or {Derdriu} of the Sorrows

She lived for a time in Alba with her companions, whose chanting caused every beast and cow within earshot to give two-thirds more milk.  A man sent to protect her and her three companions was forced by an oath to attend several ale feasts, and a man sent to spy on her lost an eye to a thrown fidchell piece.  The sight of a raven sipping blood in the snow prefigured her affair with a son of Usnach [OOS-nach].  Fergus took up service with Ailill [AL-il] and Medb [MAYV] after Eogan treacherously killed her lover Noisiu [NOY-shu].  FTP, name this character in the Ulster cycle whose incredible beauty brought many sorrows.

answer: {Paul} (or {Pal}) {Erdös}

Together with Copeland, this man gives his name to a normal number obtained by concatenating the primes, while the Diophantine equation “sum from j equals one to m minus one of j to the n equals m to the n” is named for him and Moser. He named and derived a lower bound for the happy end problem, and with Selberg he demonstrated a number-theoretic proof of the prime number theorem. In 1958, he linked graph theory with Ramsey theory and combinatorics. He referred to beautiful theorems as coming “straight from the Book.” FTP, identify this prolific Hungarian-born mathematician, whose namesake number gives the collaborative “distance” from another mathematician to him.

answer: Wilfred {Owen}

In one of this man's poems, Abram refuses to “Offer the Ram of Pride,” instead slaying “his son, / And half the seed of Europe, one by one.”  Another of his poems opens with the line, “I, too, saw God through mud,” and a third poem pairs hall and Hell in his characteristic double consonance or pararhyme.  In addition to “The Parable of the Old Man and the Young,” “Apologia Pro Poemate Meo” and “Strange Meeting,” he wrote a poem which states of the title characters, “Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle / Can patter out their hasty orisons.”  FTP, name this man whose poems were collected and published posthumously by Sassoon, including “Anthem for Doomed Youth” and “Dulce Et Decorum Est.”

answer: {Sixth} Crusade

This campaign was initially proposed at the Council of Ferentino and then renewed at San Germano. The army set sail in the midst of a malaria epidemic, and the Langrave of Thuringia fell ill soon after departure from Brindisi. It resulted in the signing of a flimsy ten year truce with Melek el-Kamel in return for aid against al-Nasir, after the marriage of the main participant to Yolande, the daughter of John of Brienne. This chain of events was quickly repudiated by Pope Gregory IX, a long time enemy of this campaign's leader who declared himself regent King of Jerusalem. FTP, name this crusade officially begun in 1228 CE after many years of delay by Frederick II.

A stretch of bars in 7/4 (“seven four”) time in this work's Finale was its composer's first use of metrical irregularity, and the composer noted his delight with its natural-harmonic string glissando in Expositions and Developments. The Sinfonietta on Russian Themes by the teacher of its composer informs the oboe melody in this work's Khorovod section, representing a round dance of thirteen princesses.  A solo bassoon represents the title creature luring a castle full of monsters to sleep in the Berceuse, after forcing them to exhaust themselves in the Infernal Dance of King Kastchei.  FTP, name this Stravinsky ballet in which the magical title creature gives Ivan one of its feathers.

This thinker discusses artistic portraits, Stendhal, and a “Psychology of the Interesting Man” in his On Love: Aspects of a Single Theme, and he authored the collection The Mission of the University.  A book by David Muga reconsiders this man's hypothesis holding that “experimental science has progressed thanks in large part to the work of men astoundingly mediocre.” That formulation was put forth in a book with chapters entitled “The Primitive and the Technical,” “The Height of the Times,” and “The Barbarism of Specialization.” The author of The Dehumanization of Art, FTP, name this 20th century philosopher who wrote Invertebrate Spain and The Revolt of the Masses.

answer: {Thomson} scattering

The partial linear polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation is the result of this physical process. In deriving this non-relativistic process, the magnetic component of the Lorentz force is neglected, and the relevant particles are modeled as being in a damped harmonic oscillator. Its total cross section is independent of the frequency of radiation and scales as the square of the particle's Compton radius. For ten points, identify this scattering of electromagnetic radiation from a charged particle, named after the discoverer of the electron.

Cities in the central region of this country include Vanch and Jirgatol, and its northwest contains the Zarafshon River. Its capital sits at the foot of the Hissar Mountains and contains the suburb Varzab, once a major recreational center. The highest point is Ismail Samani Peak and its extreme northern peninsula contains the city of Khujand and begins to stretch into the Fergana Valley. Most of the mountainous Pamirs range is contained in this country, whose capital was for a time renamed Stalinabad.

He resents Julius Beaufort, whose daughter Fanny later marries his son Dallas. His best friend Ned Winsett and Theodore Roosevelt, convince him to go into politics, and he never keeps his promise to visit the niece of Medora Manson. Unable in the end to visit Ellen Olenska after discovering that his love for her was known to his wife May Welland, for ten points, identify this protagonist of Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence.

answer: {Mapp} v. {Ohio}

One concurring justice in this case draws on Rochin v. United States and his previous dissent in Adamson v. California, while the majority opinion often cites the cases of Boyd v. United States and Weeks v. United States as historical precedents on the central constitutional issue. Dissenters included Justices Whittaker and Frankfurter who joined with Harlan in lambasting the court for forgetting its sense of judicial restraint in overruling Wolf v. Colorado.  The wake of this decision produced a doctrine known as the “fruit of the poisonous tree.” FTP, name this 1961 Supreme Court decision in which seizure of lascivious material in a Cleveland woman's apartment was deemed unconstitutional.

answer: {African Sleeping Sickness} (accept {trypanosomiasis} before mention of {trypanosome})

Haptoglobin-related protein in a certain HDL is thought to account for the natural resistance of humans to a pathogen similar to the one responsible for this disease.  New therapies may be inspired by a recent proteomic analysis of the flagellum of the responsible agent, a kinetoplastid parasite.  The pathogen promotes its own growth by triggering secretion of interferon-gamma and produces multiple waves of fever by generating clones covered by different variable surface glycoproteins.  After breaking down the host's defenses, the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier, producing slurred speech and mobility issues.  FTP, name this disease caused by trypanosomes and carried by the tsetse fly associated with odd slumber habits.

Pierre de Castelnau was killed by Raymond VI of Tolouse after ordering one of these, and in 1961, Michael Gonzi issued one to all supporters of the Malta Labor Party. One of these was experienced in Venice in 1606 due to the refusal to hand over a convicted murder and was protested by Paolo Sarpi. An automatic one is issued for such offenses as celebrating Mass or hearing confession while a deacon or layperson, and those still in force by virtue of the Constitution Apostolica Sedis are considered censures.

One character in this story sends out two thousand bogus double-eagle coins stamped with the likeness of his opponent three days before a election.  At one point in this story a crowd breaks into a tune from The Mikado with altered lyrics, concluding with the line “But the Symbols are here, you bet!” supplied by Jack Halliday.  These Symbols are 18 of the 19 heads of the best families in town, the sole exception being Edward Richards.  They are publicly humiliated as part of an intricate plan for revenge hatched by the title character.

This legislation was enacted partly on the recommendations of the McClellan commission, and its section 504 was invalidated in U.S. v. Brown as a bill of attainder. Its section 211 was added by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act in 1974.  People covered by this legislation included those covered by the Railway Labor Act and the Wagner Act. The portions of this legislation requiring free election of officials were authored by then-Senator John F. Kennedy, and its section 602 provided for a $10,000 fine for extortionary picketing. Prompted in part by corruption investigations of the Teamsters and the Laundry Workers' Union, FTP, identify this doubly-eponymous 1959 labor bill which banned Communists from holding union offices.

The thickness of Titan's atmosphere was measured from Titan's X-ray shadow during a rare transit of Titan in front of this object.  The strong linear polarization of its white glow confirmed Shklovskii's prediction that its nonthermal emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation.  Proper motion analysis of its knotty filaments shows that its expansion has accelerated in the past 950 years.  The central object is spinning down from a rotation rate of 30 cycles per second as it transfers rotational energy to the surrounding gas via magnetic dipole radiation.  Located in Taurus, FTP name this remnant of the 1054 supernova which is powered by a central pulsar and inspired Messier to begin his catalog.

answer: Tobias George {Smollett}

One of his later works featured a haberdasher recounting ancient Japanese stories, that were, in actuality, criticisms of English policy.  That work, The History and Adventures of an Atom, appeared three years after his travelogue, Travels Through France and Italy, and Laurence Sterne parodied him as “Smelfungus” in his own travel literature.  He also translated Don Quixote into English and wrote A Complete History of England and its continuation, sales of which he boosted by placing fliers for it in church pews.  Additionally, he wrote the play The Regicide and the poem “The Tears of Scotland,” but is best known for his novels.  For 10 points, name this ship's surgeon and author of such picaresque novels and The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves and The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker.
