answer: {Decembrists} ({Decembrist revolt/movement})

The southern branch of this movement erroneously identified the Magyars as Slavs. Their leader, Colonel Paul Pestel, proposed Jacobin-style dictatorship but departed from his French model in advocating communal land ownership as a solution to the deprivation of the peasants. The competing Northern Society proposed instead emancipation and a democratic system in the constitution of Nikita Muraviev, while radicals coalesced around Kondraty Ryleev. The military officers who met in Senate Square were dispersed and exiled to Siberia. FTP, name this movement which, upon the abdication of Constantine, resisted the accession of Nicholas I as Tsar in the last month of 1825.

answer: {Les Pensees} (or Thoughts of Pascal or equivalents before mentioned)

The seventh section of this work ends with the memorable command, “be not therefore troubled,” and the sixth section considers the impossibility of a man without thought. Declaring at one point “how hollow and full of ribaldry is the heart of man,” the work begins with a statement of the difference between the mathematical and intuitive mind and goes on to draw some parallels to characters from the commedia del arte. Containing sections like “Justice and the Reason of Effects,” and “Perpetuity,” it is most famous for outlining some reasons for believing in God in the section “Of the Necessity of the Wager.” FTP, name this seminal work of Blaise Pascal, with a French title roughly translated as “the thoughts.”

answer: {surfactants} (accept {detergents} before mentioned, accept {micelles} before “{cationic type}”)

New types of these compounds are being synthesized using so-called Gemini structures. As their number increases, their scission energy generally grows as well. They are commonly classified into four groups: non-ionic and anionic types, the cationic type which comprises chains with quaternary amines and halide counterions, and the amphoteric type which have the properties of zwitterions. Beyond the CMC, these compounds form aggregates known as micelles. Usually consisting of a lipophilic tail carrying a hydrophilic head group, they include emulsifying agents and other solubilizers. Sometimes known as detergents, FTP, name these compounds which greatly reduce the surface tension of water when used in low concentration.

answer: {Absalom} and {Achitophel}

One section of this poem notes, “fainting Virtue scarce maintained her ground,” while a relevant historical reference addresses “monarchs murdered for imagined crimes” and notes that the “fleece accompanies the flock.”  Nahum Tate authored a second part a year after the first, and the original author invokes Thomas Hobbes at one point with a line about “nature's state, where all have right to all.”  Beginning with the line “In pious times, ere priestcraft did begin,” and set against the backdrop of the Popish Plot and the Duke of Monmouth's revolt, FTP name this poem that uses the rebellion of one of the title characters against King David as a pretense for discussing British politics, a work of John Dryden.

answer: {satyagraha}

To distinguish themselves from followers of Aurobindo Ghose and B. G. Tilak, its supporters were to write the slogan "do or die" on their clothing.  Its author had adopted the phrase from his reading of Tennyson.  Though it appeared in the title of a 1928 work on the struggle in South Africa, the author's African colleagues were afraid that this idea too closely approximated the "passive resistance" ideal of the English suffragettes.  FTP, name this concept deployed in the "Quit India" movement, a form of nonviolence translated as "soul force" and championed by Mahatma Gandhi.

answer: {Teotihuacan}

Leopordo Batres excavated a major building at this site, but its investigation was initially carried out by Manuel Gamio, who founded a dig campaign here in 1917, and its mapping project was headed by René Millon. The Ciudadela is the main complex at the center of this site, which is bisected by the Avenue of the Dead, and the Adosada Platform was a later addition to its Feathered Serpent Pyramid. The Pyramid of the Moon and the massive Pyramid of the Sun sit at the north and eastern ends. Translated from the Nahuatl as the “City of the Gods,” FTP, name this Mesoamerican metropolis of the 2nd-3rd centuries CE, which was apparently sacked by Toltecs in the 7th century, and sits in the valley outside of Tenochtitlan.

answer: Isaac Bashevis {Singer}

One work by this man tells of a character named Bainish who sees the ghost of his daughter Rebecca and concludes, “one should always be joyous.”  His assistant Devorah Telushkin wrote about him in Master of Dreams.  His first English language novel was The Family Moskat, which came out ten years before his poem The Magician of Lublin.  His short stories “The Little Shoemakers” and “From the Diary of One Not Born” appear in the collections A Friend of Kafka and The Death of Methuselah.  FTP name this Polish-born author of The Spinoza of Market Street and Enemies: A Love Story, perhaps best known for his tale of a fool named Gimpel.

answer: {Beethoven's} Symphony {No. 3} in {E}-{flat major} or {Eroica} or {Beethoven's Opus 55} (accept {just 3} or {Third} or {Opus 55} after {Beethoven} is mentioned)

This piece marked the first use of three French horns in symphonic orchestration.  An early C sharp is reinterpreted as D flat at the start of a downward resolution into a solo for first horn.  This occurs during the recapitulation, which sees the second horn come in four bars before the rest of the orchestra.  Its composer adapted the musical themes of its finale from his “Prometheus” Variations, and it shares its nickname with the seventh of Liszt's Transcendental Etudes.  The second movement Marche funèbre is sometimes extracted from, FTP, this symphony “Composed to celebrate the memory of a great man,” originally dedicated to Napoleon and written by Beethoven.

One man of this name planted swords in a tent to ensure the execution of Turnus Herdonius.  One man of this name forced the augur Attus Navius to cut a whetstone with a razor, and once had his cap taken and then replaced by an eagle.  A third man of this name killed or drove off Gabii's leaders after hearing that his father had cut off the heads of the tallest poppies in his garden.  The earliest married Tanaquil, his son married Servius Tullius's daughter, and his grandson Sextus raped the wife of Collatinus, Lucretia.

answer: {Ghana}

Lake Bosumtwi in the center of this nation is either a volcanic crater or the site of a meteorite impact, and the south features a promontory known as Cape Three Points. The country's highest mountains, Mount Afadjato and Mount Torogbani, are located in the far east, beyond the dam at Akosombo. That hydroelectric plant, built in 1965 shortly after independence, forms the reservoir of this nation's major lake into which white and black tributaries flow, Lake Volta. In pre-colonial times, Cape Coast Castle in the south was a center of the slave trade, while the interior was dominated by the Ashanti kingdom. FTP, name this West African nation, which under British rule was known as the Gold Coast.

answer: the {Z boson} (accept {W} before *)

Its discovery was made possible by a technology known as "beam cooling" described in a 1972 paper on "stochastic damping of betatron oscillations" by one of its discoverers. Because it does not participate in quark flavor changes*, its interactions are harder to detect than those of its two companions. It is its own anti-particle, and its signature decay is an electron-positron pair or a muon pair. Along with two other particles, it is predicted by the Weinberg-Glashow-Salaam theory, and its discovery helped earn Rubbia and Van der Meer the 1984 Nobel Prize in physics. With a mass of about 91.2 GeV, FTP name this particle which mediates the electroweak force, the neutral partner of the charged W-bosons.

Two sisters in this work confirm the identity of a corpse by the four dropped stitches on his sock.  Another character in this work forgets to buy nails to go with the beautiful white boards she purchased for Michael.  Stephen Pheety, Colum Shawn and Eamon Simon correctly predict that Bartley will not delay his trip to Connemara to sell a horse, and Cathleen and Nora secure a blessing on his voyage by shaming Maurya.  Maurya's fear after seeing Bartley on a red mare followed by Michael on a grey pony are borne out by Bartley's death by drowning in, FTP, this one-act play by Synge.

answer: {phrenology}

A handbook on this topic by Cornelius Donovan compares the practice of it to playing a musical instrument or holding a pen and notes that its greatest charm lies in its "reflective aspect as an exposition of the mental system." The Scotsman George Combe made this topic the subject of his book The Constitution of Man, and Johann Spurzheim helped spread it to Britain and American, while Bernard Hollander wrote about it in The Mental Function of the Brain. Phineas Gage was a useful case study for practitioners of this theory, developed mainly by Franz Joseph Gall. A popular 19th century pseudoscience, FTP, name this study which attempts to find meaning by looking at the bumps people have on their head.

answer: lysosomes

A prolonged fast can activate a selective pathway in these structures that involves KFERQ proteins.  I-cell disease results from a defect in the addition of the mannose-6-phosphate moiety used to target enzymes to them, and a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (“gloo-coh-ser-eh-BRO-sih-dase”) in these organelles leads to Gaucher's (“go-SHAYZ”) disease.  Their membranes contain hydrogen ion pumps and chloride ion channel proteins that maintain an interior pH of about 4.8, ideal for their proteasomes and other hydrolytic enzymes.  Autophagy occurs in, FTP, these organelles responsible for enzymatic digestion of cell components and ingested matter.

This painting was commissioned by the Baron de Julien, a priest who had cuckolded a bishop, and its artist took the job five years after returning from his Prix de Rome trip.  Julien's flush cheeks are reminiscent of the artist's style in such works as Blind Man's Bluff.  On the left, a cupid statue with a finger to its mouth observes the action from above, while two putto statues look at the title object from below.  The aforementioned bishop sits at the right side of the work, while Julien hides in the lower-left bushes and looks up the billowing pink skirt of his mistress, who is kicking off her left shoe.  A tree to the far right suspends, FTP, which title object of a lush Rococo landscape by Jean-Honoré Fragonard?

He attended Gilmore High School where he was a fencing champion in 1976, and from there he joined the Navy but had his hopes dashed when he was only stationed in Fallon, Nevada. An early girlfriend of his was Greta Post, and he was later engaged to the orthodontist Ilene Markham, played by Sherry Hursey, but they split up at the wedding and he finally married Trudy in the series finale. This came just after the death of his mother Alma, who had been quite a large presence in his life. At one point, he's suspected of carrying on an unlikely affair with Heidi, but that's soon proven untrue. FTP, name this pudgy flannel-wearing sidekick played by Richard Karn, Tim Taylor's able assistant on “Tool Time.”
