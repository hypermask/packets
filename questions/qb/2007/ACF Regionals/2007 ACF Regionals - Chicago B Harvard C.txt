answer: {gamma}-{aminobutyric acid} or {gamma}-{aminobutyrate} or {4}-{aminobutyrate}

Carbonic anhydrase mediates its theta activity in hippocampal CA1 cells.  One unusual site of this molecule's action is on adrenal chromaffin cells, where it may stimulate adrenaline release.  Bicuculline and baclofen specifically act on two classes of its receptors.  Binding of this molecule to its B receptors results in the opening of potassium channels; a similar effect results from activation of a chloride ion channel that can bind it or benzodiazepines at a different site, causing the cell's resting potential to become more negative.  Synthesized from the decarboxylation of glutamate in the central nervous system, FTP identify this inhibitory neurotransmitter.

answer: {Stark} effect

The fact that it does not affect the ground state can be derived heuristically from symmetry considerations or explicitly from the Wigner-Eckart theorem. In semiconductor heterostructures, a quantum-confined version of this effect occurs, which results from the enhancement of this effect by excitons. For higher quantum numbers, the energy levels induced by this effect are degenerate, and leading to the commonly observed quadratic form, whose components are proportional to the polarizability tensor. Particularly useful for analyzing molecular rotational spectra, for ten points, identify this effect from atomic physics, which consists of the splitting and shift of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field.

A book giving some “new perspectives” on it was published in 1983 by Jerry and Edmund Leach, and a variant of this system was discussed by Reo Fortune. One author described it as a “consecutive narrative” beginning with canoe-building and continuing through the complicated rituals involving the kitoum. Because those who perform it do not use the term “gimwali” to describe it, Marcel Mauss insisted that it is not an example of commodity exchange. Occurring in several islands in the Massim archipelago of Papua New Guinea, shell necklaces and armbands are the usual mediums of exchange. Described in Malinowski's Argonauts of the Western Pacific, FTP, identify this gift exchange system or ring.
