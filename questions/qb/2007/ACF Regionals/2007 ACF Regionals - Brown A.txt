answer: {Henry} I (prompt on partial answer and “{Lion} of {Justice}”)

This ruler's reign was preserved early on by the Treaty of Alton, and he took Adela of Louvain as his second wife.  He supposedly pushed Conan Pilatus off the Tower of Rouen, leading to its designation as Conan's Leap.  After being victorious at the Battle of Tinchebrai, he introduced pipe rolls and the office of the justiciar, first manned by Roger Salisbury.  He aimed to relieve oppression by “unjust exaction” in issuing the Charter of Liberties.  Tragedy struck when his only legitimate son died on the White Ship and, despite the marriage of his daughter Matilda, he was succeeded by Stephen of Blois.  Known as the “Lion of Justice,” FTP, name this king of England from 1100-1135 CE succeeding William II.

answer: {Precession}

For a classical charged particle interacting with an electromagnetic field, this behavior can be derived from the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation. Relativistic time dilation as a correction to spin-orbit coupling is the known as the Thomas variety, while the third Milankovitch cycle is a manifestation of this behavior on Earth. NMR is made possible by the Larmor variety, which concerns the behavior of dipoles in an applied magnetic field, and perturbations in this type of motion cause an up-and-down bobbing motion called nutation.  FTP name this phenomenon, the change in direction of the axis of a rotating object.

Richard Lipsey developed it in a broader context, clarifying the adjustment function. Robert Solow and Paul Samuelson found that it also held in the United States and made it relevant to policymakers by introducing mark-up pricing. Edmund Phelps and Milton Friedman questioned its stability in the long run, arguing that the government could not maintain a permanent tradeoff between the two quantities in question, disagreeing with the findings made in the article “Analytics of Anti-Inflation Policy” with their view of the natural-rate hypothesis.  FTP, name this relationship depicting the inverse relation between the rate of unemployment and the rate of change of money wages in a certain curve.

answer: Fred {Korematsu} v. {United States}

Felix Frankfurter's concurrence concluded with the line “that is their business, not ours”, but Justice Frank Murphy's dissent cited House Report no. 2124. Justice Roberts also dissented, noting that the petitioner had been faced with contradictory orders, while Hugo Black's majority opinion cited Blockburger v. US in support of treating the refusal to obey the orders in question, including Order no. 34, as separate offences.However, Black justified the decision on the basis of "pressing public necessity" and military prudence, rather than racism. Arising from Executive Order no. 9066, for ten points, identify this 1944 Supreme Court decision that upheld the constitutionality of Japanese internment during World War II.

answer: {DMSO} (or Dimethyl Sulfoxide before mentioned)

Dr. Octopus once tried to use a mixture of poisonous ink and a derivative of this to kill the readership of the Daily Bugle. Stanley Jacob discovered that it could be used to carry biological compounds deep into tissue, and it is often used as a topical analgesic. In the first step of the Swern oxidation, one molecule of it reacts with a molecule of oxalyl chloride, forming an intermediate that decomposes and is attacked by an alcohol. The deuterated variety is a common solvent in proton NMR. It can be added to a PCR reaction mixture to pry apart G-C rich templates more easily, and is an excellent solvent for the Williamson ether synthesis and SN2 reactions in general. With chemical formula C2H6SO, FTP name this polar aprotic solvent that easily seeps through skin, whose abbreviation stands for dimethyl sulfoxide.

These structures are used in solving the cycle detection problem because the solving algorithm halts on the second detection of the smallest value of a sequence. A slotted channel is used in an algorithm employing these structures in collision resolution, and they are also used in LRU page-management. They are used in a method of memory allocation contrasted with heap-based allocation, and to implement reverse Polish notation calculators. The SP and SS registers on the Intel x86 architecture are used to implement this data structure first proposed by Friedrich Bauer. Containing two basic operations for adding and removing data, push and pop, FTP, identify these last-in-first-out data structures.

answer: {Joseph S. Nye}, {Jr.}

During the 2004 Presidential election, he was seen as the most likely pick for John Kerry's National Security Advisor. One of his early works, a collaboration with Robert Keohane, championed the idea that international relations cannot be analyzed on a state to state basis, an idea called complex interdependence.  In later works, he argues that the US must maintain its hegemony not by military might or economic incentives as in the neorealist view, but by diplomacy and noncoercive means, or “soft power.”  The author of Power and Interdependence and The Paradox of American Power¸ FTP, name this current Kennedy School of Government professor, the founder of the IR theory of neoliberalism.

answer: {John Claggart}

The features of this character's face are all cut as those on a Greek medallion, barring his chin that resembles that of Reverend Dr. Titus Oates. Thick black blood oozes from his face of pallid complexion upon his death, leading his superior to exclaim that his body “is the divine judgment on Ananias!” He states that “a mantrap may be under the ruddy-tipped daisies” when informing his superior about the conspiracy of the “Handsome Sailor,” but a confrontation with the foretopman earns himself a fatal blow to the forehead. A death sentence for the title character comes with the death of, for ten points, which master-at-arms of the Bellipotent in Herman Melville's “Billy Budd”?

Arkady Rossovich was infused with a cheaper variant of it by the Soviet Union, and others who use it include the assassin Yuriko Oyama.  The formula is a top-secret government recipe, and one use of it was jointly developed by Lord Dark Wind and Dr. Abraham Cornelius, and later used on Laura Kinney during her childhood in captivity.  This same excruciatingly painful process was used on James Howlett during a secret Department H initiative, and he bears both the scars and positive effects to this day. Quite malleable when liquid but indestructible when cooled, FTP, name this fictional metal of the Marvel Comics universe bonded to the skeleton of Wolverine.

In this work's long first movement, the first of the three opening orchestral chords oddly lacks a B flat note, and each chord is followed by a short cadenza.  Its second movement, in B major, ends with a long pedal point beginning with the French horns that sees a semitone drop from B major to B flat on the bassoon lead directly into the third movement, which is back in E flat major.  Its Vienna premier featured the composer's student Carl Czerny as the soloist, due to the composer's deafness.  FTP name this work for solo keyboard instrument and orchestra, the last such work written by Ludwig van Beethoven.

answer: {hyphae} (before “extension of the terminal cell,” accept {mycelium} or {mycelia} and prompt on septum or septa)

Electron dense spheres known as Woronin bodies sometimes block pores in the dividing walls of these structures.  They grow by extension of the terminal cell, which involves dissolution of the old and formation of a new wall, or septum.  They can specialize to form reproductive structures known as conidiophores, or aggregate to locate resources beyond a zone of depletion, forming rhizomorphs.  They can also invaginate plant cells in the form of haustoria, transferring organic carbon to the rest of the thallus.  FTP name these tubular structures that form a network known as the mycelium in many fungi.

answer: John {von Neumann} or Margittai Neumann János {Lajos}

This man proposed the axiom of foundations and introduced the idea of a proper class to resolve Russell's Paradox. His work on Hilbert's Sixth Problem led him to axiomatize quantum mechanics by viewing physical quantities as operators in a Hilbert space, and with Bernays and Godel he gives his name to a set theory equivalent to Zermelo-Frankel. He proved the minimax theorem characterizing zero-sum games with perfect information, and the equivalence of cellular automata and Turing machines.  In a report on the EDVAC, he introduced a namesake computer architecture. Responsible for introducing backwards induction in Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, FTP identify this Hungarian-born mathematician.
