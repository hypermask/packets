The enzyme that synthesizes this molecule can be inhibited by the antibiotic oligomycin. Fritz Lipmann first proposed the important role function this molecule has while one reaction producing this molecule occurs in the thylakoid. Along with NADPH, this molecule is produced in the light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis in a process known as photophosphorylation while this molecule is also produced alongside NADH in glycolysis. Adenylate cyclase uses this molecule to produce cyclic AMP. For 10 points, name the primary biological energy currency that is found in the mitochondria.

answer: {viscosity}

One method for solving for thermodynamic pressure utilizes a constant of proportionality named after the “volume” or “bulk” version of this property. This property is zero in Euler's fluid equations and the Prandtl number is given as the kinematic version of this property over thermal diffusivity. This property's kinematic version is also a parameter in the Navier-Stokes equations and there is also a dynamic version of it. Below the lambda point, helium fluids possess a value of zero for this quantity, as they become superfluids. For 10 points, name this property, which quantifies a fluid's internal resistance to flow.
