answer: {punctuated equilibrium}

This theory originated as an offshoot of Ernst Mayr's concept of genetic revolutions by speciation, but was greatly expanded by the author of a 1971 paper citing fossil records of trilobites, Niles Eldredge, as well as Stephen Jay Gould. It opposes the phylectic type of another idea and explains the lack of transitional forms in fossil records. Stating that most sexually reproducing species experience little change for most of their history and that their evolution occurs in short, rapid spurts is, for ten points, what evolutionary theory often contrasted with phylectic gradualism?

answer: {ex} [read e to the x] or y = {ex} or f(x) = {ex} [read f of x equals ex] or the {exponential} function

This function can be defined as the limit as n approaches infinity of the quantity one plus x over n, all raised to the nth power. The Taylor series for this function, along with the Taylor series for sine x and cosine x, allow one to derive Euler's formula. This function is also its own derivative. As x approaches negative infinity, this function's graph will approach the x-axis from above but not touch it, and it increases without limit as x approaches positive infinity. For 10 points, what is this function, the inverse of the natural log of x?

answer: {octet} rule [prompt on {rule} of {eight}]

This rule was born out of the Abegg's rule, which concerns the difference between the maximum and minimum valences that an element can take. The 3-center-4-electron model explains the violation of this rule by hypervalent molecules. This rule is also violated in molecules such as boron trifluoride and free radicals such as nitric oxide, both of which react to obey this rule. Gilbert Lewis introduced this rule to explain the chemical inertness of noble gases. For 10 points, identify this chemical rule that states that atoms seek to attain a configuration with eight outer electrons.

answer: {Second} Law of {Thermodynamics} [those versions were by Lord Kelvin (William Thompson) and Rudolf Clausius, respectively]

One version of this law states that heat cannot flow spontaneously from low temperature to high temperature. Another version of this law states that it is impossible to convert heat completely into work in a cyclic process. Maxwell proposed a thought experiment in which sorting air molecules seems to violate this law. For 10 points, identify this law, credited to French physicist Sadi Carnot, which states that in a closed system, a process that occurs will tend to increase the total entropy of the universe.
