When this mathematical quantity is zero, a system of linear algebraic equations has no unique solutions, and, for a scalar, this value is defined to be the scalar itself. One way to solve for it in a system of equations is to divide this result with the solution values in place of the coefficients of that variable by this result of the coefficient matrix of the variables in a process called Cramer's Rule. For 10 points, name this result which, for a 2 by 2 matrix, is found by subtracting the product of the numbers off the diagonal from the product of the numbers on the main diagonal.

answer: ferromagnetism

This type of magnetism can be induced by running an alternating current through a coil until there is a saturation of dipoles in an area called a domain and all of the dipoles are aligned in a process called hysteresis. These dipoles are formed from the electron pairs in the material, and unpaired electrons are aligned together. The magnetized object will continue to keep the field unless it is moved to an environment with a temperature greater than its Curie point, where it will lose it altogether. For 10 points, name this type of magnetism that is usually found in materials containing iron.
