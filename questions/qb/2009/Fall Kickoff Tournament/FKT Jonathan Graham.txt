answer: {electronegativity} [accept word forms like {electronegative} but {nothing else}]

This chemical property can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy and electron affinity of the atom, or from the dissociation energies of the bond, for which the sign of this quantity is chosen intuitively. This property tends to increase from left to right on the periodic table due to increasing atomic number, and it tends to decrease going down the periodic table due to shielding by inner electrons. Used to determine if a bond is polar or covalent, this is, for 10 points, what chemical property that measures the ability of an atom to attract electrons in a bond, first calculated by Pauling?

answer: {entropy}

This quantity can be calculated from the Sackur-Tetrode equation for monoatomic ideal gases. Classical mechanics show that this quantity would decrease if a system were split into multiple systems without bringing in any new particles and it is known as the Gibbs Paradox.

For 10 points, name this measure of the disorder of a system, which tends to increase over time in a closed system.
