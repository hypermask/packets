answer: {Canizzarro} reaction

A 2008 paper from Ishihara et al found that anhydrous phenylglyoxal is a solution to the problem of low reactivity of an asymmetric variety of this reaction with alcohols. A similar reaction to this one involves using aluminum alkoxide catalysts and instead of its normal products produces ethers and is named after Tischenko and Claisen. The first step of this process involves the nucleophilic addition of a base to a carbonyl group to give an alkoxide which is then deprotonated to create a namesake di-anion intermediate. One version of this reaction utilizes formaldehyde as a reducing agent to yield a higher output of an alcohol product and is known as the crossed version. Producing both an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, FTP, identify this disproportionation reaction discovered in 1853 by an Italian chemist.
