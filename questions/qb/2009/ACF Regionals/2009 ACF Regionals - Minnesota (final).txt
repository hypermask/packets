answer: {QCD} or {Quantum Chromodynamics}

In the chiral limit, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model can be seen as a phenomenological version of this theory, and one version of it was formulated using an invariant equal to the trace of a path-ordered exponential known as the Wilson loop, and is referred to as the “lattice” variety.  Another version relies on a series of factorization theorems, called the “perturbative” variety. The Gell-Mann matrices are the infinitesimal generators of the SU(3) group, which is central to this theory, and Gross, Politzer, and Wilczek derived one feature of this theory, which states that particle interactions will become weak at shorter distances, known as asymptotic freedom. FTP, name this theory that explains the strong force in terms of quarks, gluons, and color charge.

answer: {cholesterol}

A mutation in the enzyme catalyzing the final step of its biosynthesis gives rise to Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, while its presence in plasma is measured by the Lieberman-Burchard test. The SREBP transcription factors are regulated by this molecule. One step of its biosynthesis sees the creation of a certain 2,3-epoxide, which then cyclizes, and it is sometimes stored in chylomicrons. Farnesyl pyrophosphate and squalene are intermediates in that process and that pathway begins with the condensation of three acetyl coAs to yield HMG-CoA, which is reduced to mevalonate. That step is regulated by drugs called statins. For 10 points, identify this ubiquitous steroid that can cause atherosclerosis when bound to lipoproteins.
