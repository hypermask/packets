**Huang et al. showed that expression of microRNAs miR-373 and miR-520c promotes this process by suppressing expression of CD44. Gain of function mutations in the transcription factor Twist can promote this process by incorrectly  inducing the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition. Activation of matrix metalloproteases to degrade the basal lamina and facilitates this process, but it is frequently abortive because the cells are ripped apart by shear forces. In vitro, this process can be analyzed using a trans-well migration assay and is responsible for 90% of the deaths due to cancer. For ten points, identify this process by which a tumor leaves the tissue where it developed and colonizes other areas of the body.

This man corrected the Clausius-Mossotti equation to account for permanent dipoles in a gas, and he confirmed the existence of the acusto-optic diffraction with Sears. With Lorenz and Mie, he lends his name to a model of light scattering by a spherical particle. His temperature is defined as his frequency multiplied by Planck's quantum constant, divided by Boltzmann's constant.
