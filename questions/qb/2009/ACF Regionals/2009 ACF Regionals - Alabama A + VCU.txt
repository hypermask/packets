answer: {determinism}

Xia argued that the time-inverse of an exponentially accelerating object, or "space invader," would violate this idea. Peter van Inwagen's Mind and Consequence arguments support this idea, while John Norton attempted to disprove it for Newtonian physics using an example of a ball at rest rolling off a frictionless dome. Richard Taylor used the example of an "ingenious physiologist" who is able to induce volitions into other subjects to refute this idea's "soft" type, which is also known as compatibilism. Its "scientific" type is illustrated by Laplace's demon. For 10 points, name this philosophical belief that past events and the laws of nature necessitate future events, which is opposed to the idea of free will.

**The main diagnostic symptom of this disease also characterizes a disorder that is one of the Jones criteria and is associated with streptococci infections, called Sydenham disorder. This disease causes depletion of CREB binding protein, and the main protein involved in this disease interacts with HIP1, a clathrin-binding protein. It chiefly occurs due to the presence of an excess of 36 contiguous glutamine residues in a polyQ sequence near the amino terminus of said protein. The mutation of a namesake gene on chromosome 4 results in, for 10 points, what autosomal dominant disease that causes involuntary muscle movements and progressive cognitive degeneration due to the aggregation of a misfolded protein in the central nervous system.

answer: {Zeeman} effect

**Atomic absorption spectroscopy uses this effect to correct background, and in EPR this effect creates a gap in the energies of a paramagnetic center, which is then matched by a microwave emission. The alpha and pi lines that this effect produces absorb plane polarized radiation in perpendicular directions and the anomalous form of this effect prompted Landé and Heisenberg to introduce half integer quantum numbers. Also used to explain the Lyman-alpha transition in hydrogen, it can be reversed when sufficiently large field strengths disrupt the coupling between orbital and spin angular momenta in the Paschen-Back effect. For 10 points, name this effect, which occurs due to the splitting of energy levels and associated spectral lines by an external magnetic field.
