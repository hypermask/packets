**Two relatively uncommon ways to treat low levels of this hormone involve using demeclocyline or chloropropamide, although it's more common for patients to receive a similar 8-lysine hormone from pigs.  The high level of the receptor for this hormone in the brains of male prairie voles compared to male meadow voles may explain why the former are monogamous.  This nine amino acid chain, like oxytocin, is released into blood circulation through the posterior lobe and has a precursor synthesized in the hypothalamus.  Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus arises when a certain organ doesn't respond to this hormone through its V2 receptors.  For 10 points, name this hormone, which results in more concentrated urine as it causes the kidneys to conserve water.

answer: {Quantum Hall} Effect

**One form of this phenomenon can be modeled with a hierarchical model developed by Haldane and Haperin.  When plotted against the chemical potential and another value, the integer version of it colors Hofstadter's Butterfly.  Dan Tsui and Horst Stromer won a Nobel Prize for analyzing a variant of this where multiple particles are in motion.  The fractional form produces narrower plateaus than the integer form, the latter of which involves Chern numbers.  As a result of this effect, discovered in the inversion layer of a MOSFET by Klaus von Klitzing, the elementary charge, filling factor and Planck's constant determine its namesake's conductivity.  For 10 points, name this effect from physics, whose classical analog describes the perpendicular voltage generated by applying an electric current perpendicular to a magnetic field.

Samples can either be ground into a nonvolatile mull of nujol or spread across a pair of salt plates. In this technique, higher stretching frequencies tend to correspond to bonds to lighter elements like hydrogen, and one part of it is the group frequency region.
