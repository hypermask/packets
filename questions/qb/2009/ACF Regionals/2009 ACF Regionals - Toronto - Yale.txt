**Applying an inversion to this figure gives the Dupin cyclide, and the systole and area of one of these figures is related by Loewner's inequality. The Weyl group can be defined as the normalizer of a group isomorphic to one of these figures, modulo the centralizer of said group. A compact Lie Group has a maximal one of these, and the standard one of these requires seven colors to color according to the Heawood conjecture. Double and triple ones of these have more than one handle, and N-dimensional ones are the direct product of a circle with itself n times. FTP, name this shape important in topology which is homeomorphic to the coffee cup and is shaped like a donut.

answer: Barro-{Ricardian} equivalence or Barro-{Ricardo} equivalence proposition

One formulation of it stated that families are infinite dynasties with intergenerational altruism in order to support it, but that work was criticized by Martin Feldstein due to its ignorance of population growth. Its modern form was proposed in the article "Are Government Bonds Net Wealth", but it was first proposed in the article “Essay on the Funding System”, but then later retracted. Sometimes also named for Robert Barro, FTP, name this theory that states the change in demand is the same whether a government finances itself with debt or taxes, named for the author of The High Price of Bullion and proponent of comparative advantage.

answer: Cosmic {inflation}

Fischer and Schutzhold developed a simulation of this process in a Bose-Einstein condensate. This process' original formulation relied on bubble nucleation, which lead to the “graceful exit” problem; Steinhardt addressed that issue with the “slow-roll” variety of this process. A chaotic version of this process would result in fractal structuring and was proposed to be still continuing according to Linde.  Proposed to solve the flatness, horizon, and monopole problems, evidence for this process includes the existence of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. FTP, name this process proposed by Alan Guth, in which the universe expanded very rapidly after the big bang.

answer: {analyticity} [or {analytic} propositions; or {clear}-{knowledge} equivalents]

Paul Boghossian argued that rejection of the Frege-type is equivalent to meaning indeterminacy a paper entitled this concept “reconsidered.” In Language, Truth and Logic, A.J. Ayer claims that all meaningful propositions are empirically verifiable or have this property. According to Quine, defining this property in terms of truth-preserving interchangeability relies on a notion of synonymy, although Two Dogmas of Empiricism shows that such a definition is circular. Kant attributes this property to the statement “gold is a yellow metal,” but not to “7 + 5 = 12.” For 10 points, name this property of statements like “all bachelors are unmarried,” contrasted with synthetic propositions.

answer: {B} cells

These cells are infected in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Belimumab is used to inhibit the growth of these cells, which express TNF receptor superfamily 17 genes when mature and requires Pax5 expression for differentiation. These cells express CD20 throughout their lifetimes, and use somatic hypermutation in one important process, which also sees a recombination between V, D and J exons of a certain gene cluster. They are partitioned into plasma and memory types, and are usually activated by helper-T cells in response to an infection. Usually produced in the bone marrow, FTP, name these antibody-producing lymphocytes, the basis for humoral immunity.
