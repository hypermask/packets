answer: {Green Florescent} Protein or {GFP} ({FYI}, the {Lictman/Staines thing} is {called} "{Brainbow". How awesome} is that?!)

**The A206K mutation of this protein breaks its tendency to dimerize. Pedelacq and Cabantous developed a hyperfolding mutant of this protein, which builds on an earlier F64L mutant. Lictman and Staines used several variants of it to distinguish groups of neurons in one system, and another set of mutations causes it to become sensitive to pH changes, creating the super-ecliptic pHluorins. Its function is reliant on a F-S-Y loop embedded within a beta-barrel. Two variants of it are used in a common FRET system; those are the cyan and yellow varieties. Chalfie, Tsien, and Shimamura won the Nobel prize for characterizing, FTP, what protein used as a reporter and originally found in jellyfish, that glows a particular color?

Pershin and Di Ventra proposed that this device can work based entirely on the electron-spin degree of freedom. Tungsten oxide was used in this device in a 1990 article describing its possible use in electronic neuron networks. The graph of its IV characteristics was described to look like “pinched hysteresis loops” by the scientist who defined it as a two-terminal element in which the magnetic flux is a function of the amount of electric charge passing through it. In the current version of this device two layers of titanium oxide are used, one of which contains TiO2-x instead of TiO2. For 10 points, identify this device postulated by Leon Chua which is able to change and maintain its namesake value based on the current and voltage across it, the fourth fundamental circuit element.

answer: {Poisson} Distribution

The non-linear Anscombe transform on this type of variable sets the variance of it to 1, and Dobinski's formula demonstrates that nth Bell number is the nth moment of this distribution.
