answer: {capacitors} [accept condensors before it is read]

These components stop working at the "breakdown voltage." They have the ability to pass AC and block DC current. When these circuit components are in parallel, they have the same applied voltage, and their characteristic value adds up. When connected in series, their equivalent characteristic value is found by summing the reciprocals of each individual value. The simplest type of this device is the "parallel plate" type, in which two metal plates are separated by a dialectric material. The first device of this type was known as a Leyden Jar. For 10 points, name this circuit component, also called a condenser, which stores electric charge.
