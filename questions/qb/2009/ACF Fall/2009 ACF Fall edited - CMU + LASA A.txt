answer: {restriction} enzymes [or {restriction endonucleases}]

Deviation from optimal pH or ionic strength results in star activity in this class of proteins. Dcm and Dam methylation in bacteria introduces resistance to the activity of these proteins, which are used to analyze RFLPs. Engineered constructs with multiple cloning sites can be acted on by many of these enzymes. Examples of these enzymes common to digests are XbaI [x b a one] and BamHI [bam h one], and the action of these enzymes results in the formation of either blunt or sticky ends. For 10 points, HindIII [hin d three] and EcoRI [eeko r one] are what types of bacterial enzymes that are useful for cleaving DNA at specific sites in biological experiments?

answer: {Cherenkov radiation} /effect

The Askaryan effect can generate this phenomenon, whose alteration by a periodic grating is the Smith-Purcell effect. Hankel functions were utilized by Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm to develop a formula calculating the intensity of this effect. It occurs when an electromagnetic field in a local medium is disrupted, releasing photons that constructively interfere and is often considered an analogue of a sonic boom. For 10 points, name this effect named for its Russian discoverer which occurs when particles propagate faster than the local speed of light through a medium, generating an oft-seen blue color.

answer: Bekenstein-{Hawking} radiation or effect [prompt on “{black}-{body radiation}”]

A Rindler observer near a Cauchy horizon sees an analogue of this phenomenon due to the Unruh effect. The power of this phenomenon decreases with increasing source mass, implying that currently-evaporating sources must be small. Its associated temperature is proportional to the surface gravity of the source, and it arises when one particle from a pair production event tunnels out through the event horizon. For 10 points, identify this type of thermal radiation that causes mass loss in black holes, named for the British physicist who wrote A Brief History of Time.
