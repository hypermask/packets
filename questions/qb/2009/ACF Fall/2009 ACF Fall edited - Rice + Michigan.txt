answer: {ketone} [prompt on “{carbonyl}”]

The enantioselective reduction of these compounds by a bicyclic boron-containing proline derivative in the presence of diborane was pioneered by Corey, Bakshi, and Shibata. A hydroxyl aryl version of this functionality is produced in the Fries rearrangement. When acting on a secondary but not a primary alcohol, the Jones reagent produces this functionality. In the presence of acid or base, it forms a tautomer with enol, and in solution with ammonium silver nitrate, this compound fails to produce a precipitate. Thus, it has a negative result in the Tollens test. For 10 points, name this functional group, consisting of two alkyl groups attached to a carbonyl group, the simplest of which is acetone.

When two of these are near each other, the Fujiwhara effect occurs, resulting in their centers orbiting around a point in between the two systems. Their formation is aided by upper-level speed divergence in the vicinity of the jet stream coupled with weak surface convergence. They must form in high humidity regions at least 5 degrees from the equator because the Coriolis effect is crucial to their initial rotation. These systems are classified by winds reaching a 12 on the Beaufort scale. For 10 points name these tropical storm systems that contain areas of low pressure and warm circulation, an example of which sees a calm at its center or “eye.”

answer: friction

Various phenomena associated with this force can be described by the creation and annihilation of modes called shearons. Defects along a surface can lead to energetic corrugations resulting in this force according to the Tomlinson model, which describes it on the atomic level. The triboelectric effect is charging as a consequence of this force, whose “skin” variety occurs at a body-fluid interface. It is independent of surface area according to one of Amontons' Laws, and superlubricity is the total absence of this force. For 10 points, identify this force which is perpendicular to the normal force and provides resistance when two surfaces slide over each other.
