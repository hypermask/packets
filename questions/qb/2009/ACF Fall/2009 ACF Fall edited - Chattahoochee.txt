answer: {Pullman} Strike

This event started out as a peaceful meeting at Blue Island, but Edward Walker was appointed to deal with its participants after this event turned violent. Its participants disregarded Attorney General Richard Olney's attempts at mediation. Over the objections of Peter Altgeld, President Cleveland ordered federal troops to enter on the grounds that this event was disrupting mail service, a costly mistake which would lead to President Cleveland's failure to recapture the Presidency in 1896. For 10 points, name this riot launched in response to the Panic of 1893 in which labor workers led by Eugene Debs refused to run trains containing cars made by a certain company.

answer: second law of thermodynamics

The original Thomsen-Berthelot principle, also known as the principle of maximum work, was shown to violate this law because it failed to incorporate irreversibility. The Kelvin-Planck statement is one component of this law, and a flaw in Boltzmann's H-theorem concerning this law and time reversal symmetry is Loschmidt's paradox. A thought experiment in which an imaginary creature guards a trapdoor between a two-part gas container was proposed to try to violate this law. Clausius stated it as heat cannot flow from a hot object to a cold one spontaneously. For 10 points, name this law which says that the entropy of a system increases until it reaches equilibrium.

answer: {Midnight's Children}

One character in this work leaves a note saying “I divorce you” after Emerald reveals he has been hiding in the basement. Its narrator describes his grandfather falling in love with his grandmother after examining her medically through a perforated sheet. Mary Pereira works at the Braganze Pickle factory that the narrator starts to manage just before his son Aadam says his first word, Abracadabra. One character founds a street gang, becomes a war hero, and helps the government sterilize the title characters after discovering he was switched at birth with the protagonist. For 10 points, name this novel about Saleem, Shiva, and other Indian children born on August 15, 1947, a work of Salman Rushdie.

answer: {Beethoven's Fifth} Symphony in C {minor} [accept {Fifth Symphony} after {Beethoven} is mentioned]

A pair of horns in this piece was supposed to recapitulate a theme in C major, but was replaced by its composer in that section by bassoons. 29 C major chords end this symphony whose first movement contains a brief oboe cadenza and whose third movement scherzo transitions into the finale. This symphony's most notable feature also appears in its composer's Appassionata sonata, and is played in E flat major after several imitations of the notes G-G-G-E flat, which is commonly described as “Fate knocking at the door.” For 10 points, name this Beethoven work that precedes the Pastoral Symphony.

answer: {Leviathan}

This work concludes by mentioning a Roman judge who would ask accusers cui bono. Its first section, “Of Man,” gives competition, diffidence and glory as the three causes of conflict, while its middle two sections discuss commonwealths and Christian commonwealths, respectively, and its fourth and final section is concerned with a “confederacy of deceivers” called the kingdom of darkness. This work argues that only a strong sovereign can prevent a war of all against all. For 10 points, name this work which characterizes life as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short,” a book by Thomas Hobbes.

answer: {superconductivity} [or {superconductor}]

The tunneling of electrons between objects displaying this property separated by an insulator is described in the Josephson effect. When metals with this property are placed in a magnetic field they repel the field demonstrating perfect diamagnetism, which can be seen in the levitation of a magnet above them. That effect postulated by Ochsenfeld and Meissner is described in a theory of it stating that this arises from the condensation of electron pairs. That BCS theory states this phenomenon is linked with the formation of Cooper pairs, allowing for increased electric flow. For 10 points, name this property characterized by zero resistance in very cold metals.

answer: {Scranton}

This city is the setting for a Harry Chapin song in which a fatal truck accident spills the title amount of fruit. This setting for “Thirty Thousand Pounds of Bananas” is also the setting of a play and film about the twenty five year reunion of a basketball team called That Champion Season. Along with Wilkes-Barre, this city has a Triple A baseball team which dropped its association with the Phillies and replaced the Columbus Clippers as the Yankees top farm team. This city's Poor Richard's Pub is a favorite haunt of characters like Kevin Malone and Stanley Hudson. For 10 points, name this Pennsylvania location of Michael Scott's branch of Dunder Mifflin on The Office.

answer: Willa {Cather}

In one of this author's novels, Pavel tells a story about how he threw a newlywed couple out of a carriage to save himself from wolves. In a second novel by this author, Frank shoots his wife Marie when he finds her cavorting with the protagonist's brother Emil in an orchard. In the former novel by this author, the protagonist first works for the Harlings and then takes a job with Wick Cutter after establishing a relationship with Jim Burden in Black Hawk.  The latter work of this author centers on Carl Linstrum's relationship with Alexandra Bergson and is set in Hanover, Nebraska. For 10 points, name this author of O Pioneers! who wrote about the Bohemian Shimerdas in My Antonia.

answer: Alfred, Lord {Tennyson}

In one poem by this author, the gossip Miriam Lane reveals the identity of the title character after he returns from being lost at sea to find his wife Annie married to Philip. This author of “Enoch Arden” noted that his sorrow came from the “depth of some divine despair” in “Tears, Idle, Tears.” In another work, this poet wrote “Sunset and evening star, /And one clear call for me!” and expressed his hope to see his “Pilot face to face.” He also described a group of six hundred who rode “Half a league onward” “into the valley of death.” For 10 points, name this poet of “Crossing the Bar” and “The Charge of the Light Brigade,” the longest serving Poet Laureate of Great Britain.

answer: {coagulation} [or {thrombosis}; or {clotting} before mentioned]

Dicumarol, a coumarin derivative, inhibits this process by blocking the VKORC enzyme, thereby preventing proper carboxylation of proteins involved in it. Warfarins prevent this process in a similar feedback system, and it involves a certain factor that binds to exposed collagen in endothelial cells. That von Willebrand factor is deficient in the same-named disease characterized by an abnormality in this process. One of its initiating factors is thrombin, which converts fibrinogen into fibrin to form a thrombus. This process is characterized by fibrin polymerization to form a mesh-like framework together with platelets at the site of a wound. For 10 points, identify this deficiency of hemophiliacs, the process by which blood clots.
