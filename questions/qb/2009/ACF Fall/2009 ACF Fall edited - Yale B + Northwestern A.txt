answer: simple {harmonic oscillator} [or {SHO}; prompt on “{spring}” or “{pendulum}”]

The Rodrigues formula and Hermite polynomials figure into the analytic method for finding the wavefunctions of these systems. The allowed energies for these systems can be calculated using the ladder operators. A quantity determining peakedness for energy graphs of these systems is the dimensionless quality factor. Their behavior can be split into transient and steady-state motions when they are subjected to a sinusoidal driving force and a simple damping force, and they exhibit resonance at certain frequencies. For 10 points, name this kind of system whose periodic, sinusoidal motion is described by Hooke's law, examples of which include a mass on a spring and a simple pendulum.
