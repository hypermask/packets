answer: {Cape} Town

The flat roofs prevalent in this town owe mainly to the influence of architect Louis-Michel Thibault. One of the traditional boundary markers of this city was formerly called Lion's Rump, and it is bounded to the south by Devil's Peak.. Sailors who confused this city's chief bay with another led to that smaller bay being named False Bay, and one of its main thoroughfares is Adderley Street, renamed from Heerengracht in 1850. Sections of this city that houses the City Bowl include those along Table Mountain, and Guguletu and Nyanga West were its two main black ghettos. Containing the Castle of Good Hope, for 10 points, name this legislative capital of South Africa.

answer: {time dilation} [prompt on "{special relativity}" before mentioned]

Rossi and Hall measured the extent to which this phenomenon affected mu mesons observed at the top of a mountain and at sea level. This concept explains why simultaneity is not absolute for individuals separated by a long enough distance, and in the transverse Doppler effect, it explains the frequency reductions seen by both observers. A gedanken-experiment involving this effect concerns the aging of an individual traveling in space versus one remaining stationary on earth. The twin paradox arises from, for 10 points, what consequence of special relativity whereby clocks in moving reference frames tick slower than those in stationary ones?

answer: {dopamine}

One major pathway involving this compound is the tuberoinfundibular one that transfers it from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. This compound is involved in voluntary motor control via its nigriostriatal pathway, and it binds with lactotrophs in order to inhibit the secretion of prolactin, which is a major antagonist of it. It is the immediate precursor of norepinephrine in the epinephrine synthesis pathway. Antagonists of this neurotransmitter are used to treat schizophrenia, and deficiency of this neurotransmitter can lead to Parkinson's disease. For 10 points, name this neurotransmitter associated with the brain's pleasure center whose precursor is L-dopa.

answer: George Brinton {McClellan}

This man was criticized by subordinate William Rosecrans for his caution at skirmishes at Rich Mountain and Philippi Races. One of this man's campaigns was stalled by the trickery of John Magruder, who made him believe that his enemy had substantially more troops. This man led one side at the battles of Williamsburg and the Seven Days Battles, part of the aforementioned Peninsular Campaign, and later his extreme caution also cost him a decisive victory when he left troops in reserve numbering more than the entire opposing army at an 1862 battle which ended the Confederate's Maryland Campaign. For 10 points, name this general, the first commander of the Army of the Potomac who led Union troops at the Battle of Antietam.

answer: {colloids}

Bentonite acts as an extreme barrier for this class of substances, limiting their mobility due to ultrafiltration. The zeta potential describes electric potential at the double layer interfaces seen in this class of substances. Their stable formation, termed peptization, is opposed by the formation of large clusters of particles in these systems, a process known as flocculation. The Tyndall effect describes light scattering through this type of substance, which is characterized by separate continuous and dispersed phases. For 10 points, name this type of chemical mixture where particles of one substance are dispersed throughout another, examples of which include foams, gels, and emulsions.

answer: {shortest}-{path} algorithms [accept {clear} equivalents; prompt on “{graph search}”, “{tree search}”, or anything {else involving searching}]

Fibonacci heaps are used in Johnson's Algorithm to determine this, and an efficient way to determine it via a best-first method is A* [A-STAR]. One variety of this class of algorithms runs in N cubed time in the size of the graph and is the all-pairs approach, which is slower than the Bellman-Ford algorithm of this type. The simplest algorithm for determining this involves a single source and a single destination with nonnegative edge weights and is named for Dijkstra. For 10 points, name this class of algorithms which determines the minimum sum of the weights between two nodes of a graph, exemplified by the quickest way to get between two cities given the time spent on roads between them.

answer: {lac} operon [accept {beta}-{galactosidase} until “{induce}”]

One assay for measuring this entity's activity involves production of the yellow byproduct orthonitrophenol from ONPG. In vivo, IPTG can be used to directly induce this entity's activity, which can then be monitored by breakdown of X-gal. This entity's structural elements produce permease and transacetylase enzymes. Cyclic AMP binds to catabolite activator protein in the positive regulation of this genetic construct, which also produces the enzyme beta-galactosidase. Its activity is negated in the presence of large amounts of glucose because glucose can substitute as a carbon source for its namesake sugar. For 10 points, identify this operon regulating the breakdown of that sugar, which is found in milk.
