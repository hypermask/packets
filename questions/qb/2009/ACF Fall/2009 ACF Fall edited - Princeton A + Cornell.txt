answer: Battle of {Stamford} Bridge

While the eventual winner of this battle offered his traitorous brother his old position back in exchange for laying down his arms, the brother's ally was only offered “seven feet of… earth.” This battle followed one at Fulford, in which the brothers Morcar and Edwin were defeated. According to legend, a single soldier held up one side's advance across a bridge over the Derwent River until an English soldier speared him from under the bridge. The defeat of Tostig and Harald Hardrada here cleared the way for the victor to proceed south, where he was killed less than three weeks later. For 10 points, name this battle that marked the end of the Viking Era whose victor Harold Godwinson would be killed on October 14, 1066, at Hastings.

answer: {calorimeter} [accept {calorimetry}]

One type of this device used in the CMS experiments of the Large Hadron Collider consists of a barrel with two endcaps and utilizes lead tungstate to determine particle energies. Another of these devices, named for Joly, consists of two spherical containers in a steam bath and measures how much condensation appears on each container.

answer: {articles} [prompt on {determiners} before “{partitive variety}”]

In Scandinavian languages, these words typically take the form of suffixes, such as the Icelandic suffix inn. French uses the partitive variety of these where English would use a quantifier such as “any” or “some.” In Romance languages, one type of these commonly derives from the Latin demonstrative ille. A second type of these is frequently identical with a language's word for “one.” Those two types are definite and indefinite. For 10 points, name this category of words, examples of which include German der, Spanish una, and English the.

Napoleon's theorem concerns the use of four of these figures to construct a fifth with special properties, and a similar method is used to locate the Fermat point for this shape. Nine significant locations on it are traversed by the nine-point circle, the center of which lies on an Euler line in this shape. Ceva's theorem concerning this shape states that lines drawn from a vertex to a side meet under certain conditions, and another statement about it allows its area to be determined from side length and semiperimeter alone. For 10 points, name this simple shape, whose area is calculable by Heron's formula and whose angles add up to 180 degrees.

He took issue with word-for-word translations in Contra Errores Graecorum and distinguished between the titular people's knowledge of God and what can be known by taking Christian beliefs into account in Summa Contra Gentiles. This man's most famous work asserts that all knowledge is abstract and that perfect happiness can only come from contemplating God. That work also includes a section in which he uses Aristotle's four causes to advance five arguments for the existence of God, who is called the “first mover” and “first efficient cause.” For 10 points, name this philosopher who wrote the Summa Theologica.

answer: {ATP} [or adenosine {triphosphate}]

The torsin protein, a member of the AAA protein family, is crucial for carrying out the role of this molecule, which tightly binds to the N-terminal domains of DnaK and Hsp70. In order for tRNA to be aminoacylated, this molecule must first react with free amino acid, and seven of these molecules can bind to the GroEL/GroES chaperone complex. It is the product of an enzyme containing F0 and F1 subunits that harness a proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain. Produced by a namesake synthase, about 36 of these molecules are generated per glucose entering cellular respiration. For 10 points, identify this energy-storing molecule, which consists of three phosphates bonded to an adenosine sugar.

answer: {messenger} RNA [or {messenger ribonucleic acid}; prompt on partial answer]

Structural differences in the product of this class of molecules are induced by selenocysteine insertion or SECIS [SEE-sis] elements. A lariat structure is formed from components of this molecule as a result of the action of the spliceosome, which serves to remove inactive portions along its sequence. Splicing occurs after a 7-methylguanosine is added to this molecule's 5-prime end, and polyadenylation generates a poly-A-tail at its other end to prevent degradation outside the nucleus. For 10 points, identify this molecule formed during transcription, a type of RNA that carries information from the nucleus to the ribosome.
