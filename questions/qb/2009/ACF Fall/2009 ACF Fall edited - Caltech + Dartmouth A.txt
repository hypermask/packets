answer: {sodium} [or {Na} before mentioned]

This element is commonly used to reduce benzophenone to the diphenylketyl radical used in hydrocarbon purification, and either it or lithium, along with alcohol in ammonia, provides electrons necessary for a Birch reduction.

answer: {eigenvalues} [or {latent} roots; {proper values}; characteristic roots; characteristic {values}]

Weyl's theorem can be used to show that the Dirchlet type of these are asymptotic, providing an answer to the Mark Kac-proposed question “can one hear the shape of a drum?”In quantum mechanics, ladder operators alter these quantities by one, and they are taken to be 1 or -1 for the permutation operator. Always real for a Hermitian matrix, they are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, and for diagonal matrices, they are given by the entries of the diagonal. For 10 points, name these scalars that, when multiplying a matrix, are equal to the product of a vector with that matrix and which are usually denoted by the Greek letter lambda.

answer: Second {Punic} War

Early in this conflict, Boii and Insubrian revolts ruined Roman plans, and its first confrontation on Italian soil, the Battle of Ticinus, forced the Romans to retreat to Placentia. The disastrous defeat of Varro and Paullus at a more famous battle caused Philip V to forge an alliance with Rome's enemies, initiating the First Macedonian War. The Romans had better luck in this war's Spanish theater, expelling the opposing general's brothers, Mago and Hasdrubal. This allowed a final push into Africa by Scipio, and there, despite his elephants, the Battle of Zama saw the final defeat of Hannibal. For 10 points, identify this second war between Rome and Carthage.

answer: magnetic {monopole}

If sufficiently light, these particles could be produced in a Drell-Yan type process which would occur in proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron. The first solution to the Yang-Mills equation was one of these particles named for Wu and Yang, and Dirac showed that these particles imply quantization of electric charge. Providing symmetry to Maxwell's equations, these particles contradict the fact that the divergence of the B-field is zero, thereby violating Gauss's law for magnetism. For 10 points, identify these particles, the magnetic analogues of charge with either north or south-oriented directions.

Its East Side Gallery featured Dmitri Vrubel's painting of an infamous kiss from Brezhnev. Wooden crosses near Checkpoint Charlie commemorate its victims, the most famous being Peter Fechter, who was shot in its 'death strip.' In response to a mass emigration, Erich Honecker began its construction in 1961 and it was dismantled 28 years later.
