answer: {ribosome}

Chloramphenicol stalls the activity of this structure, while reversal of its primary function is enabled by LepA. That function is carried out using the GTPase activity of EF-G. One of its main substrates is assembled using the enzyme aaRS, and in prokaryotes, its 16S portion attaches to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Designated 70S or 80S, this organelle transfers a nascent peptide from its P-site to its A-site where aminoacyl-tRNA accepts the polymerizing protein chain. The tRNAs then exit from its E-site. Coming in free and bound varieties, for 10 points, name this organelle sometimes found on rough ER that contains two subunits and is the site of protein synthesis.

answer: {PCR} [or Polymerase {Chain Reaction}]

A higher thoroughput modification of this technique starts at a high temperature but lowers it in small increments until it reaches a specified point. In addition to that touchdown variant, another variant of this technique simultaneously quantifies its product in real-time. It employs cations like magnesium 2+ to stabilize its products and uses dNTPs as building blocks for those products. This process uses different temperatures for its denaturing, annealing, and elongation stages, and it was greatly improved with the thermostable Taq polymerase enzyme that carries it out. For 10 points, name this common laboratory technique used to amplify a sample of DNA.

Gerald Holton discovered that seven observations in this experiment had been discarded despite giving a result within two-percent of the correct one, and Ehrenhaft performed it earlier, obtaining the quantity 2.9 times 10 to the minus 11 esu as a result. This experiment used a modified form of Stokes' law to calculate drag, and its results were likely undervalued by one-percent due to air viscosity. The setup used parallel plates to produce an electric field balancing gravity, while an atomizer to produce the namesake material similar to a perfume spray. For 10 points, name this 1909 experiment conducted by Millikan that calculated the charge of an electron.
