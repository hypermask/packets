answer: {cyclohexane} [accept {cyclohexanone} before “{complete}” in first sentence]

This compound was initially synthesized via a Dieckmann condensation of pimelic acid followed by complete reduction of the product. It is typically produced by incubating benzene with a rhodium catalyst or under very acidic conditions at high temperatures, resulting in complete hydrogenation of the benzene ring and thus production of this compound. Its substituents are deemed axial or equatorial depending on position relative to the plane, and steric hindrance is minimized in its partially twisted chair conformation, as opposed to the boat isomer. For 10 points identify this saturated hydrocarbon, a cycloalkane which consists of a ring of six carbons with formula C6H12.

answer: xylem

Libriform fibers are long pit-containing cells found throughout this tissue, and perforation plates found at the ends of this tissue can be described as simple, foraminate, or scalariform. The primary type of this tissue is located closest to the pith, and it is made up of tracheid vessels in most conifers with trachea elements performing most of its function. This tissue must use the evaporation of water at mesophyll cells in leaves and negative back-pressure at the roots to carry out its function in a process called transpirational pull, which allows water and minerals to travel up through plants.  For 10 points, identify this dead vascular tissue in plants that functions differently from phloem.

answer: {Young's} modulus [or modulus of {elasticity}; prompt on “{stiffness}”]

For a homogeneous, isotropic material, this quantity is given by three times quantity one minus two times Poisson's ratio, all over the compressibility. When a certain criterion holds, resilience can be defined as one over twice this quantity times the square of yield stress. Like pressure, it is measured in Pascals, and according to the generalized Hooke's law, this quantity is equivalent to the slope of a material's stress-strain curve. Named for the British physicist whose double-slit experiment showed that light is a wave, for 10 points, name this elastic modulus describing the ratio of stress to strain in a material.
