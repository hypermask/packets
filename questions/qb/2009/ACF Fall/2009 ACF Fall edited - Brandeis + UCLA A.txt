answer: {Hess}' law of constant heat summation [prompt on “{law} of {enthalpy}”]

The scientist responsible for this statement provides an alternate name for disilver telluride and discovered that oxidation of sugars results in saccharic acid. One consequence of this law unrelated to electricity is Kirchoff's law, and it is what allows for the calculation of lattice energy in the Born-Haber cycle. This law can be derived by considering a series of intermediates in a thermodynamic sequence and noting that the quantity it concerns is a state function, so its change is equal to the difference in the bond enthalpies of final products and initial reactants. For 10 points, identify this law of constant heat summation that states that the enthalpy change of a reaction is path-independent.

One ruler of this name and number passed De heretico comburendo to forbid translating the Bible or owning a Bible in vernacular translation, as well as permitting the burning of heretics like the then-powerful Lollards at the stake. That man, who was the son of John of Gaunt, gained power after imprisoning Richard II. Another ruler of this name fought for the throne at such battles as Ivry and Arques and was eventually murdered by Francois Ravaillac. For 10 points, give the name and number of these rulers, one of whom famously granted religious rights to the Huguenots with the Edict of Nantes and declared about his conversion to Catholicism that "Paris is worth a mass."

answer: David {Ricardo}

This economist asked “What need of a House of Commons or of a House of Lords?” in Observations on Parliamentary Reform. His namesake equivalence was popularized by Robert J. Barro. One of his works, subtitled “A Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes,” argues for the adoption of a metallic currency and is titled The High Price of Bullion. His most famous work sets out a theory of rent which was criticized by Malthus, as well as introducing the idea of comparative value. For 10 points, name this economist who wrote Principles of Political Economy and Taxation and espoused the Iron Law of Wages.

answer: Joseph-Louis {Lagrange}

An identity named for this man can be obtained by using only two, rather than four sets of elements in the Cauchy-Binet identity and gives a more general form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. This man also names the remainder obtained in the Taylor series for a function. In physics, his namesake operator is equal to kinetic energy minus potential energy, laying down his theory of mechanics. Locations in an orbital system where centrifugal and gravitational forces balance are five points named for this man. For 10 points, name this mathematician whose namesake multipliers are used to maximize a function subject to constraints.

The Zohar cites Job 1:6 and Job 2:1 to establish a two-day framework for celebration of this holiday. The Talmud states that the prediction of one's losses during the next year occurs on this holiday, whose first afternoon includes the tashlikh, or recitation of prayer near flowing water. The “days of awe” precede this holiday, which is followed by the fast day of Gedalia. If this holiday lies on the Shabbat, the Shofar is not played, but gefilte fish, apples, and honey are served regardless. Occurring during Tishrei, the seventh month of the Jewish calendar, for 10 points, name this Jewish celebration of the New Year.

This term was less famously used in 1874 by writer and war correspondent Junius Henri Browne as a title for Harper's Magazine to describe the number of people dead being greater than the number of people living.  Republicans sometimes use it to explain election outcomes in which the media predicted that the Democratic candidate would win easily, but on election day, the Republican candidate came out on top.  In a 1963 speech, it referred to Americans that did not protest the Vietnam war or participate in the media.  For 10 points, what is this term popularized by Richard Nixon for a mass of people that do not express their opinions publicly?
