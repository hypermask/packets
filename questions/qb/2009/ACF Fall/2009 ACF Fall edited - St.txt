answer: {Coriolis} effect

In electrodynamics, this effect leads to the formation of an instantaneous voltage called the Christoffel voltage, and cyclostrophic flow sees zero contributions from friction and this effect. The ratio of net acceleration of a fluid to acceleration due to this effect is the Rossby number. Its acceleration is given by negative two times the cross product between the angular velocity of the system and the velocity of the particle. It is the cause of the rotation of sunspots and creates geostrophic winds. This effect generally manifests in the deflection of an object because of the Earth's rotation. For 10 points, name this effect that does not actually change the direction of water swirling in toilet bowls.
