answer: {histones}

Rett syndrome has been associated with hypermodification of certain classes of these proteins. During spermatogenesis, they are replaced by the arginine-rich protamines, which are necessary for sperm head condensation. The largest of these, class 1, links octameric units of the other four classes. These proteins are rich in positively charged amino acids such as lysine, which is often modified in them by acetyl groups. Four types of these form part of a unit spanning 146 base pairs called a nucleosome, which is key for the supercoiling of DNA. For 10 points, name these proteins around which DNA wraps to form chromatin.

Niklas, Sune, and Allan are moves in the Petrus System used for doing this, and that system was designed to be a replacement for the more layer based Fridrich Method employed by the likes of Tyson Mao.

answer: {solar wind} [or {stellar wind}]

Hydrodynamic interactions due to this phenomenon create Parker spirals, which are a consequence of rotations of the source of this phenomenon. A strong “radiation driven” phenomenon analogous to this is observed in Wolf-Rayet stars and more generally beyond the Eddington limit in other systems. In conjuction with Earth's magnetic field, this is responsible for ‘fueling' the Van Allen Belts. The termination shock is the point where this reaches subsonic speeds, and the heliopause is where it merges with interstellar medium. This plasma flow is what causes comet tails to face away from the Sun. For 10 points, identify this stream of charged particles released from the outer atmosphere of the Sun.

answer: {comparative advantage}

According to the Heckscher-Ohlin model, this concept derives from differences in relative factor endowments.

answer: {neutrino}

The MSW effect accounts for this particle's oscillations in matter as opposed to a vacuum, and its “sterile” variety is a strong candidate for dark matter composition. The Homestake experiment attempted to count these particles emitted due to fusion in the Sun, while Cowan and Reines reacted its antiparticles with protons to yield neutrons and beta plus particles to verify this particle's existence. Studied at the Super-Kamiokande facility, this particle was postulated to allow conservation of energy and momentum in beta decay, which involves its electron type. Also coming in muon and tauon varieties, for 10 points name this chargeless lepton whose name means “small neutral one.”

A 2001 J.C. Alvarez study investigated properties of aromatic polyamides containing this class of elements, and they are reacted with carboxylic acids in the Hunsdiecker reaction. The Finkelstein reaction involves the exchange of two atoms of these elements, and the enrichment of uranium via gaseous diffusion is accomplished using a molecule containing the simplest of these elements, whose synthesis won Henri Moissan the 1906 Nobel in Chemistry. Another member of this group is used as a mordant in Gram staining and has an important role in the thyroid gland. For 10 points, identify these highly reactive Group 17 elements that include iodine and fluorine.
