answer: {photons} [accept {gamma rays}; prompt on {spin}-{0 particles}]

The fact that these entities are predicted to have greater-than-unity transmission probability at an infinite potential barrier is the original form of the Klein paradox. That paradox can be resolved in part by noting that, above a cutoff energy, these particles will react with a strong electric field to produce an electron and positron, a phenomenon known as pair production. Spontaneous emission of one of these particles occurs when an electron drops from a higher to a lower energy state, and the energy of one of these particles is given by Planck's constant times the speed of light over wavelength. For 10 points, name these particles, the quanta of light.

Another ruler of this polity allied with the Tuaregs to take Air and Agadez, and, like Mali's Mansa Musa, went on an extravagant pilgrimage to Mecca in 1497, but a hundred years later this empire disintegrated after losing to a Moroccan army at the Battle of Tondibi. 10 points, name this empire centered at Gao, whose leaders included Ishaq II, Askia Muhammad and Sunni Ali.

answer: {molecular orbital} theory [prompt on {orbitals}]

One useful approximation in this theory uses variationally minimized matrix elements that act as coefficients in a linear combination of orthonormal basis functions due to single atoms. Its namesake constructs are the eigenfunctions of the Fock operator, and the square moduli of the entities it concerns give the distribution of electrons due to more than one nucleus. Its namesake entities can be determined by the aforementioned LCAO approximation, can be visualized by hybridizations such as sp3, and come in bonding and anti-bonding varieties. For 10 points, name this theory of electron distribution in chemical compounds that is more realistic than VSEPR theory.

answer: {Szent}-{Györgyi}-{Krebs} cycle [or citric acid cycle before mentioned; or {TCA/tricarboxylic acid cycle}]

In this pathway, fluoroacetate can form a derivative that permanently binds to a certain enzyme, leading to arrest of this pathway. One step involves a dehydrogenase catalyzing the formation of the anion ?-ketoglutarate. That anion is produced in two steps, with a decarboxylation from oxalosuccinate following an oxidation from the iso- form of the first product of this process. Later in this process, flavin adenine dinucleotide or FAD is used to produce malate from fumarate. It is preceded by the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which combines with oxaloacetate to yield citrate. For 10 points, name this cycle, also called the citric acid cycle, which follows glycolysis in cellular respiration.

This man showed that Lie groups could be approximated by finite groups and independently proved the central limit theorem using the Gaussian error function. His namesake “degree” is the level of unsolvability of a set of natural numbers, and this man posited that there is no way to determine whether a given program-input combination will terminate, thus showing the halting problem is undecidable. Computable functions can be computed by constructs like the “busy beaver” in a certain thesis named for Church and this man.
