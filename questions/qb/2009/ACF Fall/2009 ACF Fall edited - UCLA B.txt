answer: {Diels}-{Alder} reaction

The MacMillan catalyst serves to accelerate an asymmetric version of this reaction, and Seelig showed that this reaction could be catalyzed in vitro by certain ribozymes. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules were first applied to this reaction, and in order for it to occur, one of its reactants must be in s-cis form. Driven by the conversion of pi bonds into more stable sigma bonds, this reaction almost always favors the endo product, and its simplest form is the reaction of ethene with butadiene to yield cyclohexene.  For 10 points, name this doubly-eponymous reaction, a 4+2 cycloaddition between a diene and dienophile.

answer: {externalities} [or {spillover}]

In a two product economy, the output of product of one product affects the production function of a second product in a condition of this type which is named for JE Meade. According to the Coase theorem, market failure is due to transaction costs, not to these, which Coase describes as a joint product of a victim and a polluter.

answer: {open} [accept word forms like {openness} or {open set} etc.]

Topological spaces are termed Lindelof if every cover with this property has a countable subcover, while the existence of a finite subcover for every cover of this type commonly defines a compact space. A set possesses this property if every point in the set has an epsilon-neighborhood in the set. This property is not necessarily possessed by the intersection of an infinite number of sets of possessing it because that intersection can form a single point, which notably lacks this property. Often denoted for intervals by parentheses at the endpoints rather than brackets, for 10 points, identify this property, which, for a set, can be formed from the complement of a closed set.

answer: {hippocampus} [prompt on “{limbic system}” until “{alveus}”; {then} do not accept it]

This structure is the chief source of mammalian theta rhythms.  The alveus portion of it forms a superficial layer between its CA region and the fimbria, and this structure is attached to the bottom of the amygdala. Antidepressants typically target this structure's dentate gyrus, which has a very high rate of neurogenesis. Damage to it results in anterograde amnesia, as this structure is necessary for the formation of new memories and general storage of long-term memories. For 10 points, name this part of the limbic system located in the medial temporal lobe, with a Greek name meaning “seahorse”.

Mylar and Kapton are films used in these objects at low frequencies. Their failure in motherboards is called their namesake “plague”, and the mica types of these objects have the advantage of being highly stable over time and at varying temperatures. For a spherical one of these, its associated quantity is defined as four-pi times the permittivity of free space divided by the difference in the inverses of the sphere's inner and outer radii. That quantity is simply defined as charge over voltage for the parallel plate type of this device. It is often symbolized by two parallel lines in circuits. For 10 points, name these devices with the ability to store charge.
