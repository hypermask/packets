answer: {Nernst} equation [accept {Butler}-{Volmer equation} before “{Butler}”]

A quantity not accounted for in this fundamental equation but considered in the Tafel equation is overpotential, and  assuming equilibrium yields an exponential form of this equation named for Butler and Volmer. The ionic flux carried by ionic species across a cell membrane is described in the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, which accurately describes electrodiffusion in this equation. It essentially states that potential is shifted by a term equal to RT over nF times the natural log of the reaction quotient. For 10 points, name this equation which determines the equilibrium reduction or oxidation potential of a half-cell in an electrochemical cell.

answer: {least squares} methods [accept {LSRL}]

Aitken developed the “General” form of this method which overcomes the “HAC” problem. X prime X inverse X prime y is a closed-form expression to calculate a parameter obtained by these techniques. Non-linear problems utilizing this method can be solved using the Gauss-Newton algorithms, and the Gauss-Markov theorem says that the parameter obtained by one type of this method is the best linear unbiased estimator. The “ordinary” form of this technique is frequently employed in regression analysis to find best-fit lines. For 10 points, identify this method which involves minimizing the second power of the difference between an estimate and an observation.
