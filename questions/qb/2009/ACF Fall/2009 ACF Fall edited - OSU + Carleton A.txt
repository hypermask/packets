answer: {photoelectric} effect [or Hertz effect before mentioned]

The Duane-Hunt law can be used to calculate the maximum frequencies observed from an inverse form of this effect. It was first seen in an experiment performed in a dark box, where the area between two brass conductors formed a spark gap, but the same could not be said for glass or quartz when UV light was shone on them. This effect is only observed in materials whose work function is less than the energy of incident particles, and the difference in those quantities gives the kinetic energy of particles emitted. Sometimes named for its discoverer Heinrich Hertz, for 10 points, name this effect in which photons striking a metal result in an emission of electrons.

answer: {power} [do not accept “{energy flux}” or the like]

The “optical” or “refractive” type of this quantity is measured in diopters and measures the ability of a device to focus light. A non-standard unit for this quantity is the ton of refrigeration, and in systems with flow, it is equal to the product of flow rate and pressure. Radiative intensity or energy flux is defined as luminosity or this quantity per unit area. In rotational systems, it can be calculated as the dot product of torque and angular velocity, while in kinematics it is simply given by force times velocity. For 10 points, name this physical quantity equal to the work done per unit time, often measured in Watts.
