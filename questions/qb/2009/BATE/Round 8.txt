answer: {Dielectric} Constant

Cyclic olefin copolymer fibers are often used since they have a low value of this. A relaxation in the crystal structure of ceramic materials causes this value to "age" over time, and it increases greatly at the Curie point. The value for polar substances such as water is extremely high, while non-polar substances have a lower value.  It is measured by the ratio of capacitance with the tested material between the plates to the capacitance with a vacuum between the plates.  FTP name this ratio of a material to carry an alternating current compared to a vacuum.

answer: {Ode} on a {Grecian Urn}

An interpretation of this work asks if there is paradox in the phrase "cold pastoral" in the final stanza. The speaker is asking what leaf-fringed legend haunts the titular object's shape, eventually inquiring about the ones that are coming to be sacrificed.  Critics argue as to who speaks the final 13 lines, perspectives include the poet or the titular object.  That titular object is described as the foster child of silence and slow time in the first stanza, and the speaker describes various images on the titular object through the other stanzas.  The speaker asserts that heard melodies are sweet, while unheard ones are sweeter, so asks the soft pipes to play on.  FTP name this poem that claims “Ye know on earth and all ye need to know is that beauty truth and truth beauty”, written by John Keats.

The most recently discovered element from this group was formed by collisions between californium and calcium. The first one was discovered by Pierre Janssen and their name was coined by Hugo Erdmann. Another element from this group was discovered by Lord Rayleigh when he noticed a difference between the mass of chemically produced nitrogen and atmospheric nitrogen. Linus Pauling predicted that one of them could form a hexafluoride compound and their filled p orbital gives them the highest first ionization energies on the periodic table. FTP, identify this group of elements on group 18 of the periodic table that include Radon and Neon.

It was established as a way to pay off loans accumulated during the War of 1812 and its legality was upheld in McCulloch vs. Maryland.

answer: {Milgram} shock/obedience/authority experiment

A somewhat tweaked version of this experiment done by Sheridan and King used a puppy and found differing results between males and females. The results of this experiment have been explained using the transition from the autonomous state to the agentic state, although other theories discuss the idea of learned helplessness, relating it to the Stanford Prison Experiment. Often used to describe the behavior that occurred at Abu Ghraib prison, it was primarily conducted to determine if the excuse of “just following orders” was justifiable for those who carried out the Holocaust. FTP, identify this psychological experiment exploring the conflict between obedience and personal conscience in which “teachers” were ordered to administer painful electric shocks to subjects.

answer: {Hardy}-{Weinberg} Equation/Law/Principle/Equilibrium

The effect of divergence on this equation can be measured using the Wahlund effect. One aspect of deviation in it can be measured using F-statistics while a general test for deviation is often done using Pearson's chi-squared test. In its simplest scenario, it is written in the form of a binomial expansion of the second power and in its simplest case, notes that the sums of frequencies add up to one. Assumptions made by it include random mating, an infinitely large population and no distinctive advantage between different traits. FTP, identify this biological equation used to determine if a population is in genetic equilibrium.
