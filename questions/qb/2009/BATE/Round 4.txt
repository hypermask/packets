answer: {Bernoulli's} equation or {Bernoulli's} principle

One can use this equation to derive Luke's variational principle, an equation used to model behavior on the surface.  Velocity can be calculated when applying it to measurements taken with a Pitot tube.  When the fluid is compressible the specific heat of the fluid must be taken into account, but it becomes much simpler when the fluid is incompressible like water.  An application of it allows boats to travel faster than the wind pushing their sails, as the sail can be used to create a pressure gradient.  FTP, name this equation important to hydrodynamics, used to describe fluid flow, named for a Swiss mathematician.
