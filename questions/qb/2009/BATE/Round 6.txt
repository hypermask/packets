answer: {Punnett Square}

1 This tool can be used to describe a certain interaction known as epistasis. A notable deviation from their predicted results can occur with linkage, while another deviation can occur with imprinting. They will not apply when only one parent has the gene such as the mother's lack of a Y chromosome, or when a trait is inherited from only one parent. Used to predict a 1:2:1 ratio for codominance, in a more familiar form they predict a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive traits in a monohybrid cross. FTP, name this tool used when studying Mendel's pea experiments that predicts a child's phenotype from the parents' genotypes.

answer: {Pythagorean} triple/numbers (prompt on things like sides of a right triangle)

They can be generated using a basic Platonic sequence and the Greeks had a formula for generating them which required two relatively prime numbers of opposite parity. They can be generated using Euclid's formula and the largest numbers in each set are odd and have prime factors of the form 4n+1. These groups of numbers are referred to as primitive if they are coprime, although they can all be multiplied by a common factor.  Fermat's Last Theorem can be seen as an attempt to find these kinds of numbers to a higher power and adding a fourth number generates a namesake quadruple, of which one example is 2,3,6,7. FTP, name these groups of numbers that include 8,15,17 and 3,4,5.
