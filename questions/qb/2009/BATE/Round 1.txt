answer: {Hydrogen} Bonds (prompt on {dipole}-{dipole} before it is mentioned)

This was used in 2004 to explain the bizarre behavior of a mixture of cyclodextrine and methylpyridine.  In NMR, they cause a shift in the signal of a proton to a lower field.  A system of them helps antibodies bind to their corresponding antigens, and they help keep molecules in DNA bound together.  The IUPAC determined that one criterion for classifying bonds as these is that they are primarily electrostatic attractive forces, not dispersive forces.  Their bond length is approximately 2 Angstroms, twice that of covalent bonds, and the strength of these bonds is about one tenth of covalent bonds. FTP, name this type of intermolecular bond that is responsible for the extremely high boiling point of water, an extremely strong type of dipole-dipole forces.

answer: {Hooke's} law

This law can be extended using an 81 coefficient 4th order tensor named for Green. In another form, this law can be written with Lamé coefficients and Kronecker's delta. Augustin Cauchy would extend this law to three dimensions using a compliance matrix. In isotropic form, it can be written generally using Poisson's ratio, or alternatively using Young's modulus and the bulk modulus. One can use it to show the linear relationship between the components of stress and strain, and for materials like steel it is only valid for its elastic range. FTP, identify this law that gives the restoring force on a spring, typically written as F equals the opposite of k times x.
