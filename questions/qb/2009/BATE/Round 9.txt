answer: {Avogadro's} number/constant (accept {atomic mass unit} before *)

Recent studies to obtain a more accurate value for this constant have used the silicon crystal structure, taking into account the various isotopes of the element. Another method for determining it involved a constant that used the fine structure constant and Rydberg constant, known as the rest mass of the electron. The earliest value for this constant was measured using the Kinetic Molecular Theory and known as * Lochshmidt's constant. Boltzmann's constant is equal to the universal gas constant divided by this number and Faraday's number is equal to the charge of an electron multiplied by this number. FTP, identify this constant that is defined as the number of atoms in 12 grams of Carbon-12, typically given as 6.02 times 1023.

answer: Jean-Baptiste {Lamarck}

Some of his first research was on worms and insects, and he is credited with coining the word "invertebrates".   He identified two forces for evolution, noting how the complexifying force will produce new organs while the adaptive force will strengthen the most used organs through evolution, and that time and favorable conditions were the two means that nature has given for evolution. An example of that is young giraffes having slightly longer necks than their parents to reach the higher leaves to support his theory of evolution.   FTP, identify this man who created the first coherent theory of evolution, famous for his basic use and disuse theory and the inheritance of acquired characteristics.
