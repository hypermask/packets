answer: {Diffraction} (Prompt on {Crystallography} after {X ray})

The Fraunhofer type requires the use of a Fresnel-Kirchoff integral. A grating of this type is used to split light into its various wavelengths, and consists of closely placed parallel slits. Patterns of it can be used to determine spacing between layers of atoms through an application of Bragg's law.   Using the de Broglie wavelength, occurrence of this for neutrons and electrons was one of the main arguments for quantum mechanics. The X-ray type of this was used to determine the shape of macromolecules like the alpha helix of proteins discovered by Linus Pauling and the double helix shape of DNA.  FTP, name this wave phenomenon exhibited by light as it curves around a thin opening, the subject of Young's double slit experiment.

answer: {Nernst} equation

 This equation can be used to map out a Pourbaix and Frost diagram.  It is used when studying cell membranes in an equation similar to Fick's law. Since one term in it is equal to zero at equilibrium, it is often used to calculate the equilibrium constant and it can be derived using a formula equal to the negative change in Gibbs Free Energy. It explains why certain net reactions can occur in a concentration cell, and it is the basic principle behind pH electrodes.  At 25 degrees Celsius, it includes a term equal to about .059; this term includes the Faraday constant. FTP, identify this equation in electrochemistry that allows for the calculation of the potential for a galvanic cell.

A formula to regulate them and minimize their range was proposed at the Tokyo Round Negotiations and is known as the Swiss formula.  This is similar to a method meant to lower them, known as the Uruguay Round Approach. Deadweight loss often occurs in small nations when these are enacted, which typically come in ad valorem and specific types. The Morrill one was enacted in 1861 while one passed during Herbert Hoover's presidency led to “beggar thy neighbor” policies and would exacerbate the effects of the Great Depression.

The term for this was coined by Walter Bradford Cannon, and it consists of both positive and negative feedback mechanisms. The Gaia hypothesis discusses the interaction of the various Earth systems in regards to this. The structural type of it is often used in the relationship between an individual termite and the colony as a whole. An example of its application is a person sweating on a hot day to cool down the body and this was examined when researchers subjected patients to 20 hour work-sleep cycles, de-synchronizing the body clock with the "day" clock. FTP, give this term, literally translated as "stand equally" that is the maintenance of the body temperature, oxygen level, and water levels, notably exhibited by warm-blooded animals.

It was in part triggered by Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox's statement that the success of Pearl Harbor was in part due to an “effective fifth column” and its legality was upheld in 1944's Korematsu v. United States. FTP, name this U.S. policy of relocating a certain group of Asian-Americans during World War Two.
