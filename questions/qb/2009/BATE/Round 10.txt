answer: {Buffer} solutions/agents

Cacodylate is often used as one to avoid the precipitation of calcium phosphate while monopotassium phosphate is often used as one in food products. Universal ones can be made with Borax and potassium acetate and are often used on glass electrodes. When choosing one it is critical to know at what range it works best, known as their namesake “capacity”. Essentially using the common ion effect to obtain its effectiveness, a common one is a 1,3 diol known as Tris. Found in a bicarbonate form in human blood, their effectiveness can be measured by using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. FTP, identify these solutions that are often composed of a weak acid and its conjugate base and resist changes in pH.

answer: {Six Day War} (prompt on {1967 Arabl-Israeli conflict} before it is mentioned).

The hostilities preceding this conflict were in part caused by the Samu Incident. David Elazar would lead one side in the northern campaign of this conflict and the naval part of it was largely limited to the sinking of El Mina and the quick capture of Sharm-el Sheik. Its largest front saw the defeat of a force intended to target Eilat, rapid advancement in the Wadi Haroudin and major victories for the armored forces of Ariel Sharon. One of its causes was the closure of the Straits of Tiran and it would begin with an airstrike that crippled the Egyptian air force. In the end, the roots of the Intifada were laid, as the winning side captured the Golan Heights, Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip and West Bank. FTP, name this 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict named for the short amount of time it lasted.
