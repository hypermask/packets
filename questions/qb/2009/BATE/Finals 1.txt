answer: {Cretaceous}-{Tertiary extinction} event (Accept {K}-{T extinction} event or {Cretaceous}-{Paleogene} Extinction Event, also accept extinction of {dinosaurs} or anything about the {dinosaurs going extinct 65 million years ago because} of an {asteroid}, {just} be very lenient...)

A less popular theory explaining this event used evidence found at the Deccan Traps. Occurring at the end of the Maastrichtian stage, other theories point to change in sea level and sea temperature. It saw a shift from angiosperms to ferns in land plants and saw little impact on organisms relying on detritus. Higher than normal levels of Iridium, first discovered in Gubbio, Italy, have helped explain this event. However, the most popular theory explaining this event was proposed by Walter and Luis Alvarez and was based on evidence found by Glen Penfield near the town of Chicxulub. FTP, a crater in Yucatan, Mexico is often used as evidence for what event that occurred 65 million years ago?

answer: Ether

One of these organic compounds reacts with phosphorous pentaflouride to form Lawesson's reagent and is known as anisole. Another one of these organic compounds is a common solvent for Grignard's reagent and is often referred to as THF. One of these occurs as an oligomer and can form complexes with metals like potassium and lithium; these are known as the “crown” type of these organic compounds.

Bell, in which Justice Oliver Wendel Holmes, Jr., infamously stated “three generations of imbeciles are enough”. FTP, identify this policy of selective breeding to control human heredity, typically associated with Nazi Germany in the form of racial hygiene.

A parody of this event on Family Guy was caused by David Hyde Pierce. It was further parodied at the end of the South Park Episode, “Good Times with Weapons”.  It was the subject of a lawsuit by Terri Carlin which apparently sought billions of dollars in damage and it caused the television show “ER” to edit the scene of an elderly patient in an episode aired shortly after this event. It was part of a larger event that also included Nelly and Kid Rock and it occurred at the end of the song “Rock Your Body”.  Despite the harsh criticism it received, it was poked fun at a year later in a GoDaddy.com advertisement. Although CBS quickly went to an aerial view, it was not enough to prevent over half a million people from complaining to the FCC. FTP, name this controversy during the Super Bowl 38 half time show.

answer: {Telomerase}

The inhibitor GRN163L binds to the RNA template of these.  In humans this enzyme is made up partly of TERT, which has a coding region 3396 base pairs long.  A therapy using this enzyme is being used in new cancer treatments because scientists in a Dallas hospital detected it in 90 of 101 tumor samples but in none of the 50 normal tissue samples. This enzyme has been shown to add the TTAGGG sequence to DNA in the 3-prime region of vertebrates, and is a reverse transcriptase. This enzyme allows for the replacement of lost bits of DNA, and without it cells will reach their Hayflick limit. When it is dormant in cells they will become unstable and eventually die.  FTP, name this enzyme that works on the telomeres.

He helped prevent scurvy by packing sauerkraut on his first voyage, a trip meant to observe the passage of Venus in front of the Sun from a particular location that was once known as George III. His second voyage was meant to determine the status of a land that he had previously studied in his first voyage and was once known as New Holland.

answer: Lines composed a few miles above {Tintern Abbey} on revisiting the banks of the Wye during a tour

answer: {elastic} collisions (prompt on collision up until coefficient of restitution of 1 is mentioned, after that, don't accept collision)

A technique that uses high energy ions to determine the properties of a material uses this process and is called Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. Objects undergoing this process have a coefficient of restitution of 1 and effective neutron moderators essentially work by undergoing this process. Space exploration vessels using a slingshot orbit undergo this process with gravity and the large return height of the smaller ball of the double ball experiment is due to this process. More famously, the pressures of ideal gases can be calculated by assuming they undergo this process. FTP, identify this type of collision where the total energy of the colliding bodies is conserved.
