answer: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

This idea was expanded upon with Clayton Alderfer's ERG theory and one aspect of it can be tested with John Curtis Gowan's Northridge Developmental Scale. Norwood used this theory to propose that humans can seek coping and helping information, while William James proposed a similar version which stated material, social and spiritual levels. First proposed in a 1943 paper titled A Theory in Human Motivation, one of its levels had earlier been introduced by Kurt Goldstein and it states that factors like food and safety must be satisfied before more complex desires like self-esteem and confidence are met. FTP, identify this psychological concept whose seventh level is self-actualization, an idea proposed by Abraham Maslow.

answer: Chitin

A research team showed that mice injected with this material have a buildup of interleukin-4 cells, characteristic of an allergic reaction, and this material has also been used by medical teams as a biodegradable suture. A similar structure has random portions of deacetylation and is more soluble in water, while a sample of this material over 25 million years old was discovered, proving its longevity. It has a structure that is similar to cellulose, with a hydroxyl group replaced by an acetylamine, and its unique properties are largely derived from the hydrogen bonding due to this difference. Composed of monomers of N-acetylglucosamide, FTP, identify this polymer found in the cell walls of fungi and the exoskeleton of arthropods.

answer: {Gadsden} Purchase

It was preceded by a dispute in the Mesilla Valley and its underlying cause was visible when one side attempted to purchase the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, although the other side had already chosen Don Jose de Garay to build colonies there. Its namesake was the former president of the South Carolina Railroad Company who hoped to build a southern railroad to the Gulf of California. It consisted of land south of the Gila River and was so unpopular for one side that it caused Santa Anna to be removed as dictator.

answer: {Ohm's} Law

A counterpart to it involves reluctance and is known as Hopkinson's Law. It can be applied to hydraulics in describing the relationship between pressure and flow rate. The continuum form of this law can be combined with the integral of the electric field and the cross-section area to get another form. Another version of this law expresses two of the values in root mean square form and switches another of the terms for impedance. Modified versions of this law include one that has a term for self-inductance and another that can be used to calculate the electromotive force. FTP, name this law that states that voltage is equal to the product of current and resistance.

answer: {LeChatlier's} principle

The namesake of this law also wrote a thesis on hydraulic mortars and determined the composition of plaster of Paris, while Paul Samuelson introduced an application of this chemical law to economics.  Knowing the pressure before and after is only important if either the reactants or the products are gaseous, and, if there are the same numbers of moles of gaseous molecules on both sides, there will be no predicted change.  An example is watching the color change in a syringe of NO2 and N2O4 as it is pulled, as NO2 is a brown gas and N2O4 is a colorless one.  It is applied in the Haber process when the ammonia that is produced is removed from the solution so that the reaction will produce more of it.  FTP, name this rule that states when a reaction is subjected to a stress it will shift to counteract that stress.

Early in thiis film Horace Miller is chosen, although that decision meets with loud disapproval.

answer: {Pi}

Its inverse can be determined using the Chudnovsky formula. Its Engel Expansion has 1,1,1 as its first three digits and the first three digits of its continued fraction are 3, 7 and 15. Its square root is equal to the gamma function of ½ and the square root of twice this number appears in the denominator of the formula for the standard normal distribution. The Leibniz formula converges to this number divided by four and Euler proved that e to this number, times the imaginary number, equals negative one. The Egyptians used 2 to the 8 divided by 3 to the 4 to approximate it, and several proofs have been formulated to show that it is less than 22/7. FTP, name this mathematical constant equal to a circle's circumference divided by its diameter that is often approximated as 3.14.
