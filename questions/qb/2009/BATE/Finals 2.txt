answer: {Raoult's} Law

A more general version of this law is the DECHEMA model, which adds activity coefficients. It can be derived using the definition of chemical potential and substituting in fugacity and the way it can predict boiling point elevation relates it to Duhring's Law. Its validity for multiple components can be shown using the Gibbs-Duhem equation while for certain substances; it can be seen as a special case of Henry's Law. Mixtures of polar components often show a positive deviation from it while mixtures adhering to this law are known as ideal solutions. Notably exceptions from this law are azeotropes.  FTP, identify this chemical law that states that the total pressure of a system is equal to the partial pressure of each component times it mole fraction.
