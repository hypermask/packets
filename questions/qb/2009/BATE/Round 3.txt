answer: Great {London Fire} (accept {London fire} of {1666}, prompt on {London fire}, accept {clear knowledge} equivalents)

1 Daniel Baker would warn of this event more than 100 years before it actually occurred. The ruler of the country declared that it was caused by an act of God although many were still convinced that it was caused by the French or Papists. Mayor Thomas Bloodworth brushed it off initially by saying that "A woman might piss out". Robert Hooke was among those who were considered in its aftermath, although the person chosen would be appointed King's Surveyor of Works and would rebuild St. Paul's Cathedral. Starting at a bakery on Pudding Lane and famously recorded by Samuel Pepys (pronounced "peeps"), this is FTP, what famous conflagration that destroyed much of the capital of Great Britain?

answer: Raising the Flag on {Iwo Jima} (accept equivalents)

One of the men depicted would die ten years later on the Gila River Indian Reservation after drinking himself to death. The event it depicts was ordered by Chandler Johnson and the difficulty in carrying out this event caused Rene Gagnon and John Bradley to come the aid of the original group. Robert Denig attempted to learn the identities of the men depicted and Gagnon initially refused to name Ira Hayes. Used by the Treasury department to raise over 200 million dollars, this work was used by Felix de Weldon as the model for a sculpture near Arlington National Cemetery. FTP, name this Joe Rosenthal photograph that shows six U.S. military personnel atop Mount Suribachi in 1945.

answer: {Cosine} function

In a certain range it can be approximated using Hardy's approximation and it has a fixed point at Dottie's number, a value roughly equal to .74. A discrete transform of this type is used in compressing JPEG images and its hyperbolic form can be used to describe the shape of a catenary. The dot product between two vectors is equal to their norms times this function. Its hyperbolic form can be written as the sum of e to the x plus e to the negative x all divided by two, and the first three terms of its Taylor series expansion are 1, minus x squared over two, plus x to the fourth over 24. FTP, name this function that is the multiplicative inverse of the secant function and can be calculated in a right triangle as adjacent divided by hypotenuse.

answer: {Leviathan}

This work claimed that there is no justification for supernatural rules taking precedence over civil law, and it proposed a test to determine which scriptures should be applied and which should not. This work also claimed that society allows no right to rebel against the titular figure, and it identified three characteristic features of men, including desire for glory and safety, that make the titular figure necessary. FTP, identify this work which called human life “nasty, poor, brutish, and short” and advocates escaping from the state of nature by trading liberty for the protection of the titular ultra-strong ruler, written by Thomas Hobbes.

answer: Thomas {Malthus}

A book discussing the impacts of the Green Revolution, written by Eric Ross, is titled this man's “factor”.  His namesake league, founded by Charles Bradlaugh, showed a general level of discrimination against the poor and, in another work, he wrote that the value of land is equal to whatever value remains after the land has been used for cultivation. In one work, he argued against the poor laws, discussed the rapid growth of European colonies, and argued that while the human population grows at a geometric rate, the food supply only grows at an arithmetic rate, leading to epidemics, famines, and other disasters. FTP, identify this English economist who wrote the famous An Essay on the Principle of Population.

answer: Ernest Miller {Hemingway}

The vice of the Mexican Cayetano in Montana leads to him being shot in this author's The Gambler, the  Nun and the Radio while two waiters are at a café late at night in another work. In addition to short story collections like In Our Time and Man Without Women, he wrote about fishing boat captain Harry Morgan in one novel while Lady Brett Ashley falls in love with the expatriate Jack Barnes in another work. Several of his stories feature the recurring character Nick Adams and his last major work centers on the marlin pursuing fisherman Santiago.  FTP, name this American author of A Farewell to Arms and The Old Man and the Sea.

answer: The {Mongol} Invasion(s) of {Japan} (accept equivalents)

The first one occurred partially in the Saga region, and led to the construction of a 100-mile-long, 2.5-meter-high stone wall and hundreds of wooden structures known as “fireflies”. One part of it saw the Southern Route Army fall behind schedule, causing the Eastern Route Army to wait and die of the heat. The ship captain's insistence to board the invasion boats in order to avoid being marooned in a foreign land doomed the first one, after the defending force retreated to Dazaifu. The second one was doomed as, close to victory in the Battle of Koan, the kamikaze typhoons wiped out the invasion force over the course of two days. For 10 points, Kublai Khan attempted to conquer the island of Kyushu two times in what invasions during the Yuan Dynasty?

answer: Martin Luther

This person was protected by his territorial ruler, Frederick III of Saxony, not because the two agreed on theology but because he felt it was his responsibility to intervene on behalf of one of his subjects. As a result, instead of heading to Rome, this person met his opponent, Cardinal Cajetan, for a debate at the southern German city of Augsburg. In that debate, Cajetan charged him with directly contradicting Clement the Sixth's Unigenitus Dei Filius. This and other offenses led to his excommunication in Exsurge Domine, a papal bull issued by Leo the Tenth. This man later made a “stand” at the Diet of Worms, and one of his works was a response to Johann Tetzel's sale of indulgences. FTP, identify this German theologian whose posting of his 95 Theses is considered the start of the Protestant Reformation.

answer: {ChloroFluoroCarbons} [accept {CFC}]

They were first developed in the 1930s as an alternative to Sulfur dioxide, and became popular because they are generally non-flammable, non-toxic, and non-reactive. Inhalation of them will affect the nervous system and may lead to sudden death, a method by which many teenagers committed suicide. In 1987 the Montreal Protocol was signed in an effort to reduce the production of these substances, and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol identified their replacement as one of the leading greenhouse gasses. DuPont has trademarked the name Freon which contains these types of materials. For 10 points, name these chemicals found in refrigerator coolant, air conditioners, and in plastic foams and aerosols that are responsible for 80% of ozone depletion.
