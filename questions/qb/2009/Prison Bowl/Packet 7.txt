The constant of proportionality for their entropy is k over 4 Planck lengths, and is proportional to surface area. String theorists describe them as "fuzzballs", and they indirectly cause the Lense-Thirring effect. “Mini” ones may have formed by the Big Bang, although they evaporate through Hawking Radiation. They can be completely characterized by only mass, charge, and spin, according to the no-hair theorem.

answer: {chloroplasts} (prompt on plastids until “Tic” is read)

Some sea slugs have the klepto type of these. They contain translocons called Tic and Toc, which transport essential proteins into them from the cytoplasm. Multiple ones can function as a network when interconnected by stromules. When electromagnetic radiation enters one of these, an electron transport chain is set off, resulting in NADPH. Made up of stacks of thylakoids called grana, they are filled with a liquid containing ions and enzymes, including RuBisCO. Found in bacteria, algae, and plants, their distinctive color comes from the a and b types of chlorophyll. For 10 points, name these green organelles where photosynthesis takes place in plants.
