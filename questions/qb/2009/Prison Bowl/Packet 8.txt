answer: {incest} (accept obvious equivalents)

While in most nations this act is illegal, Sweden, Japan, and France notably do not prohibit it. Tantra Buddhists encourage it, and the implication of the alliance theory of Claude Levi-Strauss is that prohibition of it is at “the dawn of culture” and “culture itself” because it forces kin groups to interact. The Westermarck Effect suggests that it is avoided because of environment and not instinct, and it may not necessarily be biologically disadvantageous since some harmful genes are dominant. Freud's idea of Electra and Oedipus complexes suggests that children secretly desire, For 10 points, what act of inbreeding?

answer: {Le Châtelier}-Braun Principle

Deoxygenated blood has a greater affinity for carbon dioxide, according to the Haldane effect, which is derived from this statement. The van 't Hoff equation calculates the effect of this statement for temperature. Long term elasticity is higher than short term elasticity, according to the application of it by economist Paul Samuelson. Raising the temperature in an exothermic system decreases the amount of the product, due to this, and the common-ion effect is a consequence of it. For 10 points, name this chemical principle that states that when a system undergoes external stress, its equilibrium shifts to counteract the stress and minimize the change.

This man declared his support for the Antipope Victor IV at the Synod of Pavia after he was excommunicated.

The Knudsen type occurs at low pressures in porous media and is governed by the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation, while the Bohm type occurs in plasmas acted upon by a magnetic field. Used in doping semiconductors, it is governed by two laws named after Adolf Fick. Another law states that the rate at which it occurs is inversely proportional to the square root of the particles' masses. That law is named after the man who first studied it in liquids and gases, Thomas Graham. When it causes a solvent to move through a semi-permeable membrane, it is called osmosis. Caused by the random collisions of particles, for 10 points, name this transport phenomenon resulting in a net flow of molecules from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.

answer: {Meiji} Restoration [prompt on the {transfer} of {power} to the {Japanese Emperor} etc.]

The four divisions of society were equalized through it, and one of its major consequences was the privatization of land, allowed for the first time in the Land Tax Reform. It was resisted by groups like the White Tiger Corps and the Northern Alliance.

It can be graphically represented on the De Finetti diagram by a curved line. The F and P coefficients account for things like the Wahlund effect and imperfect panmixia. Karl Pearson confirmed it for one specific case, and his eponymous chi-squared test is commonly used to determine whether data matches this result. A small population may exhibit deviations from this result because of inbreeding and drift. In the simplest scenario it can be stated that p squared, q squared, and 2pq are the frequencies for each genotype. For 10 points, name this doubly-eponymous principle in population genetics which states that allele frequencies typically stay constant.

answer: {prime} number or {primality} (accept word forms)

Robert Carmichael names the set of false-positives in testing for this. Distributed asymptotically, a random number near a large number N has about a one over natural log of N chance of having it. Landau's problems, two of which are the Legendre and Goldbach conjectures, concern this property. Most algorithmic tests for this property are probabilistic, such as the Miller-Rabin test. The Sieve of Atkin is an optimized method of computing numbers with this property, based on the ancient Sieve of Eratosthenes. The infinitude of such numbers was proven by Euclid in his Elements. For 10 points, name this property of natural numbers with exactly two divisors, itself and one.
