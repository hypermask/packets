answer: Pierre de {Fermat}

The theorem that every positive integer is the sum of at most n n-gonal numbers is called this man's “polygonal number theorem”. The set of numbers named for him contains integers of the form 2, to the 2, to the nth power, plus one. Another of his theorems states that given any prime p and integer a, a to the pth power is equal to a mod p. In optics, he gives his name to the principle of least time. His best-known theorem, proven in 1993 using elliptic curves and the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture by Andrew Wiles, states that there are no solutions for a certain Diophantine equation with exponents greater than 2. For 10 points, name this French mathematician known for his “last theorem”.

That alterego, Theophilus, rejects the “tabula rasa” in a work meant to rebut Locke, New Essays on Human Understanding. He also proposed that there is no physical causation; rather God designed everything to occur the way it does and created “pre-established harmony.” This author of Theodicy and Monadology also believed in “sufficient reason,” a concept for which he was satirized in Candide as Dr. Pangloss, a character who maintains the faith that he lives in the best of all worlds.

Benjamin Franklin created the first flat version of these, called Franklin Squares. Early experiments used high voltages, which caused corona discharges to skew results. Failures in one type can cause production of excess hydrogen, making them swell and pop. The reservoir type acts as a rectifier, smoothing AC current, and boric acid or sodium borate is usually used in the electrolytic type. The earliest ones, invented by Pieter van Musschenbroek, were called Leyden jars. Made up of two conducting plates separated by a dielectric, or non-conducting, substance, their effectiveness is measured in farads. For 10 points, name these electrical components that store charge.

He introduced the concept of mand, a verbal behavior with motivating operations, in a work that was heavily criticized by Noam Chomsky. He argued that cultural engineering is prevented by the belief in free will represented by the titular concepts in one work, while in another, Professor Augustine Castle dramatically leaves T.E. Frazier. Planners, Managers, and Scientists constitute the thousand members of an atheist utopia in that work inspired by Thoreau.

answer: {ozone} (prompt on {O3} until “{triatomic}” is read)

In the Criegee mechanism, this compound reacts through a 1,3-dipolar cyclo·addition to cleave double bonds in alkenes. Sydney Chapman discovered the process by which this continuously regenerates. Discovered by Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1840, it gives a thunderstorm its distinctive smell. It converts electromagnetic radiation into heat energy in a reaction catalyzed by hydroxyl and chloro·fluoro·carbons. At ground level, it is a pollutant and respiratory irritant, but it occurs in high concentrations in the stratosphere, where it absorbs UV rays. For 10 points, name this triatomic form of oxygen, which has a namesake “layer” in the atmosphere.

The Turan Lowlands lie to this body's southeast, while cities of Nukus and Muynok are in Karakalpakstan, which lies to the south of this body of water. Nuclear tests were performed on its Vozrozhdeniya Island, and deserts near it include the Kyzyl Kum. The Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers both flow into this. Construction of the Qaraqum Canal off the Amu Darya to irrigate the desert for cotton farming was highly inefficient, allowing loss of 50% of the water it carried and was a chief contributor to the severe desiccation. Having lost more than 80% of its volume since 1960, this is, for 10 points, what formerly 4th largest lake in the world located in central Asia?

So-called human-jaguar copulation scenes can be found in the art of this people. A sacred bog in El Manati provides evidence of child sacrifice and also yielded figurines in this civilization's “elongated man” style, while stelae found in La Venta possibly indicate that site as a ceremonial center of the San Lorenzo phase, placed in the Early Formative Period. Depictions of these people are reminiscent of African or Chinese physiognomy, causing much speculation about these people's origins, who suddenly disappeared around 400 BCE.
