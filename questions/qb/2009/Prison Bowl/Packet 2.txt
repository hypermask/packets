answer: {Nernst} equation

The chord conductance equation contains a term that can be calculated using this equation. Along with Planck, this equation's namesake names a molar flux equation and a similar current density equation. A generalization of this equation is used in cell membrane physiology. It is a special case of the GHK equation for one ion. Its terms include R, the universal gas constant, and E-nought, the standard electrode potential. Stated in terms of Faraday's constant and derived from entropy and Gibbs free energy, it is used to find the cell potential of a half-cell.

answer: {Doppler} effect or shift

A transverse quadratic version of it, known as the Shklovskii effect, is seen in pulsars. It can be used in conjunction with the Faber-Jackson relation or the Tully-Fisher relation to estimate the distance to a galaxy. The transverse type of this effect was observed using a canal ray tube in the Ives-Stilwell experiment. Its classical formulation relates the velocity of the source, and the emitted and perceived frequencies. It is used in astronomy to measure the radial velocity of stars or galaxies, because it causes electromagnetic waves to exhibit blueshift or redshift. For 10 points, name this effect responsible for the perceived change in pitch of a moving ambulance's siren.

answer: {cystic fibrosis} or {mucovoidosis} or {mucoviscidosis} (prompt on {Argh})

An early indication of this disease is meconium ileus, the obstruction of an infant's ileum caused by thickened stools. Symptoms include malnutrition and, in males, sterility due to a congenital absence of the vas deferens. Its prevalence is due to a heterozygote advantage against cholera and tuberculosis. Because its causative mutation disrupts normal chloride transport, it is diagnosed by measuring the concentration of excreted chloride and sodium in the sweat test. Patients with this disease take antibiotics for chronic respiratory infections, and mechanical devices to clear the airway. For 10 points, name this genetic disease which, among other things, causes a buildup of mucus.
