answer: {ferromagnetism} (accept word forms, prompt on “{ferrimagnetism}”)

This property is acquired not continuously, but in small discrete steps, as demonstrated by Barkhausen noise. It can be explained by the Ising model, and is exhibited by manganese-containing Heusler alloys. Materials with this property display coercivity and remanence, which are related to the size and shape of the S-shaped curves obtained by plotting H against M, the hysteresis loop. It is history-dependent and arises when dipoles align spontaneously, but when these Weiss domains are disrupted it can turn into paramagnetism above a certain temperature. For 10 points, name this type of magnetism exhibited at temperatures below the Curie point by cobalt, nickel, and iron.
