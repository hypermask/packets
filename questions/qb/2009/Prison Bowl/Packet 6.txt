The Treaty of Constantinople set the Arta-Volos line as the northern boundary of this nation, which made large territorial gains in the Treaty of Bucharest. It was originally led by a Bavarian Prince, but a more important monarch, from the House of Glucksburg, was George I. The London Conference met after its first president, John Capodistria, was assassinated. Key victory that led to its independence was commanded by Edward Codrington, and its nationalism began in the “Friendly Society” led by Alexander Ypsilantis.

answer: {buffer} solution

MES, TAE, and tris are examples of these commonly used in biology. In 1966 Dr. Norman Good compiled a list of twelve of these with desirable characteristics such as enzymatic and hydrolytic stability, low cell membrane permeability, and a pKa, or acid dissociation constant, between 6 and 8. In 1908, an equation governing the effect of carbonic acid as one of these was written by Lawrence Joseph Henderson. That equation was later rewritten in logarithmic form by Hasselbalch. Their primary function depends on the common ion effect because each contains a weak base and its conjugate acid, or vice versa. For 10 points, name this kind of solution which resists change in pH.

answer: {Ohio} River

The Marble Hill Nuclear Power Plant is situated on this river, and other towns on this river include Lewisport and Wheeling. The McAlpine Locks and Dam can be found on this river, and the Green River and the Cumberland River both feed into it. The Great and Little Miami Rivers also empty into this river, and The Forks historically possessed great strategic value. Kanawha River is a major tributary, while its only rapids is located at Louisville, Kentucky. It is formed by the confluence of two other rivers at Point State Park.

answer: {sunspots} (prompt on {starspot} )

The Wolf number is calculated using k, the observatory factor, and the number of these present at any given time. They were very rare from 1645 to 1715, a period called the Maunder minimum. Spörer's law states that they usually appear in higher latitudes and later move towards the equator. Their area and latitudinal distribution is graphed against against time in a butterfly diagram, showing a cycle that repeats every eleven years. Coronal mass ejections and solar flares occur near groups of these features. Arising from increased magnetic activity inhibiting convection and thus lowering the surface temperature, for 10 points, name these dark regions on the surface of the sun.

answer: Thorstein {Veblen}

This man argued that economics is not “up to date” because it's not an evolutionary science, and that science is the defining characteristic of the west in “The Place of Science in Modern Civilization.” In his most famous work, he asserted that the “belief in luck” leads to proclivity to gambling, which can be traced back to the human predatory culture. He also discussed technocracy in The Engineers and the Price System.

Demonstrations at Qom and Tabriz culminated in a massacre at Jaleh Square known as Black Friday. As a result, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled the country, thus allowing the repatriation from France of this movement's chief leader, Ayatollah Khomeini.

95% of the cells in this structure occur in “grape-like” bundles around a central ductal lumen, and are shaped like truncated pyramids. The duct of Santorini in this organ is only present in some individuals. The duct of Wirsung leads to the ampulla of Vater, where it joins the common bile duct and collects the secretions of the acinar cells. It also has four other types of cells, including gamma and alpha cells, which secrete somatostatin and glucagon. Joined to the duodenum, it contains beta cells in the Islets of Langerhans. For 10 points, name this endocrine organ which secretes digestive enzymes and insulin.

He was able to write his mediation Infelix ego and the incomplete Tristitia obsedit me in prison because his torturers spared his right arm so he could sign his confession. His De Ruina Mundi and De Ruina Ecclesiae each attacked corruption and even went as far as to call the Roman Curia a “false, proud whore,” and made sodomy a capital offence. Despite the Duke of Milan and Pope Alexander VI's efforts, he gained power due to the invasion of Charles VIII and a syphilis epidemic which weakened the Medicis' control over his city.

answer: {superconductors} or {superconductivity}

Electrons can tunnel through a narrow discontinuity in one of these, even without an external voltage, according to the Josephson effect. Their coherence length and penetration depth are predicted by the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Those of type 2 transition gradually, and include layered perovskites like YBCO. A theory explaining how lattice vibrations, called phonons, and Cooper pairs work together to carry current in these materials is called BCS theory. When this type of material is cooled below its critical temperature, it becomes perfectly diamagnetic and expels a magnetic field in the Meissner effect. For 10 points, name this type of material with no resistance to electrical current.
