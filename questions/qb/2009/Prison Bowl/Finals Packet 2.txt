answer: {Lateran} (accept the Second {Lateran} Council before “first”)

One ecumenical council of this name condemned Arnold of Brescia, although its more important task was to end the Schism brought about by the rule of Anacletus II. The first council of this name reasserted that the king has secular but not sacred authority of investiture and confirmed the agreement between Henry II and Pope Callixtus II, the Concordat of Worms. The fourth was convoked by the man who ordered the Albigensian Crusade, Innocent III. It also names the treaty negotiated by Pietro Gasparri on behalf of Pius XI with Mussolini. For 10 points, name this adjective describing a “Pact” signed at a namesake Palace of the Popes in Rome.

Like slime molds, this organism's blastoderm develops as a syncytium, a cell containing many nuclei, which facilitates the injection of DNA into its nuclei. Its salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes, which have distinctive patterns of dark and light bands, and form chromosome puffs in sections where gene transcription is occurring, allowing visualization of gene activity. Its phenotypes, such as those resulting from mutations studied by Thomas Hunt Morgan, include, white eyes, yellow or ebony bodies, or having legs on its head in place of antenna. For 10 points, name this insect of genus Drosophila, a model organism in biology.

answer: {four}-{color} (map) theorem or {Guthrie's problem}

A generalization of this result involves edge contractions and is named after Hugo Hadwiger. Kittel, Errera, and Soifer showed that Kempe chains can be tangled, disproving one erroneous proof of this. Its generalization, called the Heawood conjecture, contains the floor function and could not be proven necessary and sufficient for cases of genus 0, necessitating a separate proof of this. A crossed-prism graph can show that it does not hold for a torus. Its proof, demonstrated by Appel and Hakan, involved 1,936 configurations, each reduced to a smaller graph, then checked with a computer. For 10 points, name this theorem stating the chromatic number needed to draw a map.

Athletic Bilbao's Andoni Goikoetxea [goi-ko-e-che-a] broke this man's leg in a horrible tackle as he was battling hepatitis. One of his trademark moves was a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg holding the body's weight, the Rabona, but he is probably better known for dribbling speed and technical skill with the ball. His best-known game featured one goal after weaving through 60 meters and dodging six English defenders, and another from punching the ball with his hand.

answer: First Battle of the {Marne} (prompt on “{Marne}”)

Prior to this battle, General Lanrezac was replaced by Franchet d'Esperey in command of the Fifth Army. The German commander noted that his army had made a “wheel inwards” “towards the Oise” [WAHZ]. In doing so, he exposed his right flank to General Maunoury, who promptly attacked, forcing him to open a 30-mile gap on his left between his First Army and the Second Army under Karl von Bulow. This gap was then exploited by the BEF and the Fifth Army, while Alexander von Kluck tried to rectify his “turn”. The Sixth Army held on with the help of reinforcements rushed in by 600 taxicabs, forcing the Germans to retreat. For 10 points, name this September 1914 battle, a “miracle” which saved Paris.

answer: {urea} or {carbamide}

This compound reacts with malonic esters to form barbituric acids. With formaldehyde, it comprises a transparent resin used in adhesives. It forms up to 8 hydrogen bonds with water, so it is highly water-soluble, and it is produced in a process catalyzed by arginase. Synthesized from carbon dioxide and ammonia in the Bosch-Meiser process, it is used as a fertilizer. In 1828, while trying to prepare ammonium cyanate, vitalism was disproved by Friedrich Wöhler when this compound was produced from inorganic materials.

answer: self-actualization [DU]

Eupsychia is the culture associated with this concept. It is characterized as “meta” or “being” unlike its related values which are denoted by the letter D, and unconditional positive regard is a prerequisite of it. Kurt Goldstein introduced this concept in The Organism, and it is accompanied by “peak experiences” seen in exemplary people like Frederick Douglas and Eleanor Roosevelt. Its most famous proponent summarized that “what humans can be, they must be” in Motivation and Personality. Often associated with transcendence and fulfillment of potential, it may lie below aesthetics but above esteem. For 10 points, name the highest level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

answer: {tones} (prompt on {pitch} or similar, I guess)

It is unknown whether some word-final syllables in ancient Greek possessed a change in this feature, possibly inherited from Proto-Indo-European. The Romanized Popular Alphabet of Hmong uses word-final consonants to mark these, while one transliteration, known as GR, marks these by changing, adding, or doubling a letter. Yoruba and the Bantu languages have the register form, while others have the contour form. It is thought to have arisen in some cases when syllable-final consonants eroded, and Cantonese has six while Mandarin has four. For 10 points, name these features of some languages which English notably lacks, where the pitch of a word affects its meaning.

answer: {Hooke's} law (or {equation}) of elasticity

Cauchy generalized this statement to higher dimensions and related the two quantities involved to each other via the compliance matrix and the stiffness matrix. The ratio of the two quantities involved is also known as mu, or Lamé's second parameter. It can be derived in 3 dimensions using Poisson's ratio and the Young modulus. Sensitive to temperature and loading rate, rubber is a notable exception to this law. Stated as F equals negative kx, it states that stress is directly proportional to strain. Containing the spring constant, for 10 points, name this law of elasticity named after a British physicist.
