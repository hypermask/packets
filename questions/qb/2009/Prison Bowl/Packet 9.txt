The Erd?s [EHR-dish]-Mordell inequality applies to these entities, and in one of these, the Nagel point is the isotomic conjugate of the Gergonne point.

The de Longchamps point for one lies on the Euler line, along with the nine point center, orthocenter, and circumcenter.

answer: {Bernoulli's} principle, effect, law, or equation

The Kutta-Joukowski theorem is derived from this result, and Ludwig Prandtl used Euler's equation to expand it to non-ideal states. Pitot tubes measure velocity and are based on this result, and the Venturi Effect is essentially an expression of this law for an incompressible fluid bottlenecked in a pipe. During a hurricane, windows tend to explode outwards than inwards because of this. Due to the conservation of energy, an increase in kinetic energy necessarily causes a decrease in pressure energy. For 10 points, name this principle, named after a Swiss mathematician, which explains the lift which allows airplanes to operate.
