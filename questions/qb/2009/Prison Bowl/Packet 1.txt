answer: {Qing} dynasty [{SJ/DU}]

One famous ruler had to deal with his son Yìnréng's attempts to force abdication and was succeeded by the Y?ngzhèng. Emperors belonged to the Aisin Gioro family, and this dynasty saw rebellions such as the Panthay and Dungan revolts.

answer: {Ares} (accept {Mars})

This god's son, Cycnus, tried to confront Heracles near the Echedorus River, and lost in part because Athena blocked this god's attempts to save him. He often traveled with his counterpart Enyo, with whom he fathered Enyalius, and his sister Hebe often drew baths for him. His sacred animal, the vulture, was perhaps important to him because it fed on carrion. More famous figures associated with this god are Eris, the goddess of discord, and his sons Phobos and Deimos. Caught by Hephaestus while having an affair with Aphrodite, for 10 points, name this Greek god of war.

answer: Baruch {Spinoza} (accept Benedictus {Spinoza})

He claimed that the three heads of Good that men pursue are riches, fame, and pleasure in a work examining the differences between false, fictitious, and doubtful ideas, On the Improvement of Understanding. He argued that prophets are not necessarily intelligent but simply imaginative and emphasized that religion should stay out of politics in Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, but his only work published under his name was about his contemporary, Descartes. His definition of God as Being with infinitely many attributes appeared in a work in “geometric order” and reflects his pantheism. For 10 points, name this Dutch Jew who wrote Ethics.

answer: {electronegativity} (prompt on {electropositivity} until “{ionization}” is read)

This is on the x-axis of a quantitative version of the van Arkel and Ketelaar triangles, named after William Jensen. Martynov and Batsanov introduced one method to obtain this quantity. An equation involving this quantity predicts, in kilocalories per mole, the bond enthalpy between two atoms. The arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy and the electron affinity of an atom is Robert Mulliken's definition of this. When two bonded atoms differ slightly in this, a polar bond arises from partial charges. The first derived scale measuring this quantity was that of Linus Pauling. Fluorine has the highest value of, for 10 points, what value of an atom's tendency to attract electrons?

answer: Prince Fielder

Despite claiming that he is a “big-time third-base stealer”, this player is better known for supposedly hitting a home run into the upper deck of Tiger Stadium as a preteen, which is probably not true. His first full season starting came in 2006 as his team traded away Lyle Overbay to the Toronto Blue Jays to make space for him in the starting lineup. That year, he led all National League rookies with 28 home-runs. He followed up that year by slugging 50 home-runs in 2007, becoming the youngest player to reach that number.

The plan, in violation of the Boland Amendment, was conceived by Robert McFarlane. Caspar Weinberger was convicted for lying to the independent counsel, but John Poindexter and his secretary Oliver North were not.

answer: {catenary} curve (prompt on “{catenoid}”)

This is a roulette traced out by the focus of a parabola rolled along a straight line. The surface formed by rotating this curve around the x-axis is a minimal surface, and can be formed by dipping two circles into a bubble solution and drawing them apart slowly. Its equation is given by a hyperbolic cosine function and when inverted, this curve is the ideal shape of an arch, as there is almost no shear stress between the individual stones of the arch. The Gateway Arch is built in the shape of an inverted one of these with both ends hung at the same height. For 10 points, name this curve formed when a piece of rope is hung freely from two points, pulled down by nothing but its own weight.

answer: Easter [GT]

The Quartodecimans, mostly in Asia Minor, argued for a different date for this holiday, but mostly died out after Pope Victor disagreed. The Council of Nicaea agreed with the earlier Council of Arles that all Christians should celebrate it on the same day.

answer: {Asiatic} or epidemic {cholera} (prompt on {gastroenteritis} before mentioned, accept “{Vibrio cholerae}”, I guess)

One possible treatment for this disease involves stimulating enkephalins, which inhibit the overproduction of cAMP. The El Tor strain is much milder than the classic strain, but unlike the classic strain, it is capable of host-to-host transmission. The method of its spread was discovered in 1854 when an outbreak in Soho, London was traced by Dr. John Snow to a pump on Broad Street. Electrolyte replacement therapy is essential, as a patient infected with this disease quickly becomes dehydrated through the vomiting and diarrhea it causes. For 10 points, name this gastroenteric disease caused by a bacterium of genus Vibrio, usually spread through contaminated water.

The first attempt to construct these resulted in the Aggregate Series #9 under Project Amerika, but the first true one to be used was The Digit 7, known in America as “Sapwood”. The Hiroc project resulted in the first successful one for the United States, the Atlas A, and later, the backup Titan, but have since then been replaced by the LGM-30 Minuteman, which is currently the only land-based one in use today. Defense could be classified as tactical, theater, or strategic, and could target any of the three phases: boost, mid-course, and terminal.
