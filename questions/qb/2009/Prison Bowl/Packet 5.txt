answer: {angiosperms} or {anthophyta} or {magnoliophyta} (prompt on “{flowering plants}” before mentioned)

Genetic evidence from the basal types of these organisms suggest that the genus Amborella is sister to all species within this division. They have small male and female gametophytes, allowing faster life cycles. Double fertilization leads to the production of an endosperm, a tissue within the seed that provides the embryo with nutrition. Self-fertilization is prevented by having ovaries enclosed in a carpel, which later develops into fruit. They have a specialized reproductive structure consisting of pistils and stamens, unlike the other extant division of seed plants. For 10 points, name this division containing flowering plants, contrasted with gymnosperms.

These react with carbenoids to form cyclopropane in the Simmons-Smith reaction. The alpha type can be polymerized by Ziegler-Natta catalysts, and their hydrohalogenation is governed by Markovnikov's rule. Highly substituted ones have Z and E isomers. Functional groups derived from compounds of this type include allyl and vinyl. Because the type of bond they have restricts rotation, these organic compounds have cis and trans isomers. Their general formula, the same as that of cycloalkanes, is CnH2n [cee en aitch two en]. Sometimes called olefins, for 10 points, name these unsaturated hydrocarbons with at least one carbon-carbon double bond, the simplest of which is ethylene.

The namesake cliff of this object occurs at the location of 1:2 resonance. First theorized by Frederick Leonard, the improved accuracy of charge-coupled devices was key to its discovery by David Jewitt and Jane Luu. The “classical” objects of this location are referred to as cubewanos, while the farthest ones from the Earth are two·tinos. The potential dwarf planet named for the creator god of the Tongva people, Quaoar, is in this region. The Centaurs are minor planets that lie inside it, and Nereid, Phoebe, and Triton are thought to have their origin here. Sometimes named for Kenneth Edgeworth, for 10 points, name this origin of short-term comets nearer than the Oort Cloud.

answer: {Hall} effect

A circular version of it is called the Corbino effect, and it can be measured using the Van der Pauw method. Used in a type of spacecraft thruster, two versions of it differ in whether the filling factor nu is integral or rational. A thin copper film can be used as a namesake probe, to measure large magnetic fields on the order of one tesla. With thermal, spin, and quantum varieties, it occurs because the Lorentz force pushes charge carriers to one side of the conductor, producing a measurable voltage. Used to determine the sign of the charge carriers, for 10 points, name this effect in which a perpendicular potential difference arises in a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field.
