A pseudepigraphical third one of these, considered canonical by the Syriac Orthodox Church,  attempts to further elucidate the phrase “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,” found in Chapter 15 of another one of these texts. Exegetical evidence suggests that at least four of these were written including a letter warning of sexual immoral people, and the so-called “Letter of tears.” The author in one of these commends the house of Stephanas as the first converts in Achaia after noting that he will be coming through Macedonia. Influential passages from these letters include, “through a glass, darkly” and “And now faith, hope and love abide these three; and the greatest of these is love.” Following the Epistle to the Romans, for 10 points, name these Pauline Epistles two of which form books of the New Testament written to the church of God in an ancient Greek city-state located 50 miles southwest of Athens on its namesake isthmus.

answer: {Partitions} of {Poland} [or {Partitions} of the {Polish}-{Lithuanian Commonwealth}]

Ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg threatened the destruction of a city if the first of these was not accepted, and Lowenwolde's Treaty, also known as the Treaty of the Three Black Eagles, was a precursor to them. A legislative meeting which bears the name of Nicholas Repnin provoked the War of the Confederation of Bar, which precipitated the first of these. The War in Defense of the Constitution, fought between reformers and the Targowica Confederation, resulted in the second of these, which was accepted by the Grodno Sejm [same]. Count Kaunitz pushed the first of these through against the will of Maria Theresa, and the third of these was sparked by the rebellion of Tadeusz Kosciuszko. For 10 points, name these three treaties in which Austria, Prussia and Russia divided up an Eastern European nation with capital at Warsaw.

answer: {Doppler} effect

Non-invasive measurement of blood flow is possible using an ultrasound and a laser via the photoacoustic version of this effect, while another form of this effect was detected using a Dempster-type canal ray tube and a photographic plate. Binary pulsars display a quadratic form of it known as the Shklovskii effect, and in addition to the Ives-Stillwell experiment's detection of the transverse form of this effect, this effect is the principle behind Chu, Cohen-Tannoudji, and Philips laser-cooling apparatus. The relativistic version of this effect has a coefficient of proportionality equal to the square root of one minus beta divided by one plus beta, while the classical version is simply described in terms of the velocities of the source and observer. For 10 points, name this effect in which the percieved wavelength of a wave changes with motion.

Reacting this compound with hydrogen sulfide creates trithiane, while its suspended in an 18M solution of sulfuric acid in the reagent used to test for MDMA, called the Marquis reagent. A 10% Neutral Buffered solution of this compound is used as a histological fixative, and during immunoprecipitation assays its used to crosslink proteins. In solution it polymerizes to either its “para” form or trioxane, which is why its stored as a 37% solution. The Cannizzaro reaction of this compound creates methanol and methanoic acid.

As the leader of the Army of Ohio this man led a campaign in East Tennessee which successfully defended Knoxville from the forces of James Longstreet. This man led a campaign in 1862 which captured most of the coast of North Carolina as part of the Anaconda Plan. This man's Mud March, a failed attempt to surprise Lee's forces from behind after a crossing of the Rappahannock River, led to his replacement by Joseph Hooker. This man was permanently relieved of duty for his botched efforts in the Battle of the Crater which failed to end the Siege of Petersburg. This man was offered command of one army following the failure of the Peninsular Campaign and again after the Second Battle of Bull Run, but he only accepted the position after a battle in which he took hours trying to cross a bridge defended by Confederate sharpshooters which now bears his name, the Battle of Antietam.

answer: {Peroxisomes}

Defects in this organelle can lead to Pipecollic acidemia, while one enzyme here is responsible for processing of phytanic acid during myelin sheath formation. Mutations in its ABCD1 membrane transporter result in very long-chain fatty acid buildup in adrenoleukodystrophy, and this organelle is a secondary site for beta-oxidation. PEX5 and PEX7 are responsible for transport of enzymes to this organelle, which is disrupted in Zellweger's syndrome. The enzyme with the highest known turnover rate is found here, and this organelle is responsible for the breakdown of D-amino acids. Its primary function is carried out by Asn-147 and His-74 around porphyrin rings in the enzyme catalase. For 10 points, name this cellular structure responsible for breaking down hydrogen peroxide.

answer: {Duality}

For an abelian group G, the characters of G are a locally compact abelian group that is given this name. Poincare's theorem of this type states that if M is an n-dimensional oriented closed manifold, then the jth homology group of M is isomorphic to the n minus jth such group. In projective geometry, these transformations take points to lines and vice versa, and this construct for a planar graph is another graph that contains a vertex at each planar region of the original graph, with edges connecting adjacent regions. For a vector space, this type of space consists of the linear functionals on that space, while for a platonic solid this construct is the convex hull of the midpoints of each face. For 10 points, name this concept in which two objects A and B are taken back and forth via some involution operation, whose best known example in physics is probably the “wave-particle” one.
