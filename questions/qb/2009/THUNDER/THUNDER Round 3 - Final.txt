answer: {Poisson} distribution

When data shows over- or underdispersion with respect to this distribution, a modification named for Conway and Maxwell is used. The Robbins Lemma is used to relate expected values from this distribution. The difference between two variables that follow it is given by the Skellam distribution, and its nth moment is equal to the number of partitions of a set of size n. Used to model chemical DNA mutagenesis, calls to a call center, or horse-kicks in the Prussian army, it contains a single parameter lambda which is both its mean and variance. For 10 points, name this distribution used to model rare events, named for a Frenchman.

answer: {Dipole}

The earliest type of antennas invented by Hertz created one of these configurations between ends of a wire attached at the center to a feed-driven elememnt. The power radiated by an oscillating one of these is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency divided by the speed of light cubed, and a molecule must be one of these along some axis if it is IR active. Their field intensity drops off as the inverse cube of the distance, and van Der Waals forces occur between spontaneously created ones. For 10 points, name this configuration of charges, which can be modeled as a positive charge separated from a negative one.
