answer: {Lewis Mumford}

This sociologist wrote an article in which he analyzed the Park-Bernet Galleries and examined the way in which they contributed to civic virtue in their culture. One of his works contains an examination of things like the Pyramids and the Kremlin, which this sociologist argued arose from the titular Pentagon of Power. This sociologist wrote about the way that manufacturers use advertising to negatively promote the continued technological advancement in one work, which also contains the idea that technology can be split into poly and mono varieties. Both of those ideas appeared before he wrote a work which argues that traces the evolution of metropolitan areas and urges a world that embraces a harmony between technology and culture.

One character in this novel is possessed of "a small boy's frail nakedness" and is the Irish playwright Michaelis. Ivy Bolton is hired to care for Sir Clifford in this novel, which enables the protagonist to spend more time away from Wragby, her estate. The protagonist of this novel married while her husband was on leave, but he returned from the war paralyzed, leading her to seek comfort in Oliver Mellors.

answer: {GABA} or {Gamma}-{aminobutyric acid}

Hyperforin and Deramciclane serve as reuptake inhibitors for this molecule, which are secreted by chandilier cells in one organ. During development of the hippocampus, this molecule is responsible for most excitable responses until the development of glutamate responses, and its receptors can be divided into the ligand-gated A type and the metabotropic B type. Climbing fibers and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum exclusively secrete this molecule, whose receptors are agonized by bicuculline and barbituates. Created by the decarboxylation of glutamate, for 10 points, name this inhibitory neurotransmitter responsible for anti-convulsive effects, usually designated by a four-letter abbreviation.

answer: {Muromachi} period [accept {Ashikaga} until read]

The Higashiyama culture, a blending of Wabi-sabi and Zen Buddhism, flourished during this period. The Jinno Shotoki of Kitabatake Chikafusa attempted to legitimize the court which held power in Yoshino in opposition to the puppet Emperor Komyo during this era's Nanboku-cho period. The aforementioned Northern and Southern Courts period was ended by Yoshimitsu, the third shogun of this period, and a conflict between Yamana Sozen and Hosokawa Katsumoto during this erupted into the Onin Civil War. The Temple of the Golden pavilion was constructed during this period, and Kan'ami and his son Zeami created Noh theatre during it. This period began after Takauji took advantage of the Genko War to betray the Hojo clan and support Emperor Go-Daigo in the Kenmu Restoration, and it came to an end when its capital of Kyoto was taken by Oda Nobunaga. For 10 points, name this period of Japanese history during which the Ashikaga Shogunate held power that descended into the Sengoku or Warring States period.

answer: {Mean free path}

Spectrum hardening causes this quantity to change with distance. When particles have a Maxwell distribution, the formula for this quantity contains a coefficient of the square root of 2 divided by 2, and in a gamma-ray source this quantity is the reciprocal of the attenuation coefficient. The Knudsen number is equal to this value divided by a characteristic length. Commonly used to estimate a molecule's size, it is naively defined as one over the cross-sectional area times the number of particles. Directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to diameter, for 10 points, name this value useful in the kinetic theory of gases, the average length which a particle can travel without hitting something.

answer: {Titanium}

Asterisms in rubies and star sapphires are caused by inclusions of this element, and a compound containing this metal is used in the original version of the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. This metal isopropoxide derivative is used in the Sharpless epoxidation, and one method of extracting this metal creates two equivalents of MgCl2 as a by-product, known as the Kroll process. This metal is usually extracted from illmatitte or rutile, and its tetrachloride is used as a common Lewis acid, while its nitride is used as a cover for drill bits. For 10 points, name this lightweight durable metal found in spacecraft, planes, missles, and most modern technology, with atomic number 22 and symbol Ti.

answer: {Henry III} of France [or Henry of Valois; or {Alexandre}-{Edouard} de {Valois}-{Angouleme}]

This ruler's court favorites are known as Les Mignons, and included Anne de Joyeuse and the Duke of Epernon. Upon his coronation, this ruler was forced to consent to his namesake twenty-one articles, but one requirement of that position was that he marry Anna the Jagiellonian, which he never did. A major point of contention during this man's reign was his childless marriage to Louis of Lorraine-Vaudemont, and in his early years, this ruler commanded the Royalist troops at the Battle of Jarnac in which Louis of Bourbon-Conde was killed. This ruler's promulgation of the Edict of Beaulieu, which granted concessions to the Huguenots, led Henry of Guise to form the Catholic League, and that man would ultimately force this ruler out of Paris shortly after which this ruler was assassinated by Jacques Clement. The son of Catherine de' Medici and Henry II, for 10 points, name this first freely elected King of Poland-Lithuania who is better known as the last of the Valois kings of France.

answer: {Danse Macabre}

The first version of this piece was a setting of the Henri Cazalis poem on which it is based, but it is the orchestral version that is most often performed today. The final section of this piece begins with an oboe playing a figure based on an E-flat major chord, to represent a rooster crowing at dawn. The piece opens with a harp striking the note D twelve times to represent a clock chiming midnight, which is followed by the entrance of the solo violin, whose scordatura tuning allows it to play an A-Eb tritone, or “Devil's Chord”, on open strings. This piece marks the first use of the xylophone in Western music to represent dancing skeletons; and the composer would quote this device and its associated melody in the “Fossils” movement of one of his later pieces. For 10 points, this is what symphonic poem by Camille Saint-Saens, depicting the dance of the dead?
