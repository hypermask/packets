answer: {Beta} decay

Energy emission during this process partly occurs due to "Inner Brehmsstralung", and its spectrum is directly proportional to an F of Z comma E term, which is normalized for when visualizing it on a Kurie plot. Isobaric compounds can interconvert via this process, while one version of this phenomenon has a rate proportional to the square of a polynomial of MNS matrix elements, and can be neutrinoless if the neutrino is a Majorana particle. Its Feynman diagram shows that it results from transformation of down quark to an up quark by expelling a W-minus boson, mediated by the weak force. Encompassing electron capture and positron emission, for 10 points, name this process in which a nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino, which is distinct from alpha or gamma decay.

answer: "Lines Composed a Few Miles Above {Tintern Abbey} on Revisiting the banks of the River Wye During a Tour. July 13, 1798."

This poem laments the poet's ability to hear "The still, sad music of humanity, neither harsh nor grating, though of ample power to chasten and subdue." This poem describes a sensation given to the poet of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir/Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,/ Have hung upon the beatings of my heart--." Those sensations are contrasted with ones that he felt when "like a roe, I bounded over the mountains… wherever nature led." This poem notes that "These forms have not been to me as a landscape to a blind man," but that the poet "has owed to them, in hours of weariness, sensations sweet," and much of it is addressed as advice to the poet's sister Dorothy. For 10 points, identify this poem which begins "FIVE years have past; five summers, with the length of five long winters!" since the last time the poet had visited the River Wye on which sits the title building, a work by William Wordsworth.

answer: {T} Cells or {T} lymphocytes (prompt on partial, prompt on {Thymocytes})

One subtype of these cells are dysfunctional in IPEX syndrome, and one receptor on them is targeting by the OKT3 monoclonal antibody. Their development is aided by co-stimulatory CD28 signals, and they are activated following LAT phosphorylation by ZAP70. Their development is the subject of the Differential Avidity Hypothesis, and TSLP is responsible for activating the dendritic cells that educate them; that compound is secreted from Hassal's corpuscles. CD3 is present on their surface, and during development they interact with epithelial reticular cells to undergo rigid positive and negative selection against self-antigens, which ends with them either expressing CD8 or CD4 receptors. Coming in suppressor, cytotoxic, and macrophage-activated helper varieties, for 10 points, name this type of lymphocytes that matures in the thymus that are distinct from B cells.
