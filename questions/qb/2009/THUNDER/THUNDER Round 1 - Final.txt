Marcus theory states that the Arrhenius equation's pre-exponential factor can be derived from the overlap of this quantity between donor and acceptor states, while this quantity's "leakage" into the bandgap is responsible for the Franz-Keldysh effect. The time-independent version of the Klein-Gordon equation states that its Laplacian minus its product with m squared c squared over h-bar squared is equal to zero, and for a many-body system it is assumed to be the product of several single-body ones in the Hartree-Fock. Its magnitude squared at a particular point gives the probability of finding a particle at that point. More famously, its an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian with eigenvalue equal to the total energy by the Schrodinger equation. Observers can collapse, for 10 points, this quantity denoted psi, which maps the possible states of a system to complex numbers.
