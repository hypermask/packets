answer: {Lindlar's} catalyst

This compound's discoverer used it in a synthesis alongside vitamin A with Isler and Zeller, and one compound in its final mixture can be replaced by 2,2 – ethylene dithio diethynol. Its preparation requires it to be broken up by an 8% solution of lead acetate, while an alternative to this reaction using sodium in liquid ammonia gives the trans product. This catalyst is created by adding hydrochloric acid, then sodium hydroxide, and then precipitated calcium carbonate to a sample of palladous chloride, and during use it is poisoned by 5% quinoline. For 10 points, name this catalyst used to reduce alkynes to cis-alkenes.

answer: {Metal Gear} Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (Accept either)

One weapon acquired in this game has a one-third chance of starting a tornado and blowing everyone away, and successive chapters in this game begin by one character frying eggs that sometimes have more than one yolk. The ending sees the protagonists “father” pulling the life support of Major Zero, while another character had his blood replaced by a white fluid and most of his body turned into a machine. Its final battle sees the protagonist crawling through a microwave-irradiated corridor. Crying Wolf and Raging Raven are members of the warped Beauty and Beast Corps in this game, while the main antagonist managed to steal a railgun from Shadow Moses and place it on his ship, Outer Haven. In the end, the Patriot AIs are disconnected by a computer virus created by Sunny and Naomi, Liquid Ocelt is killed, and Otacon convinces the protagonist not to die alone. For 10 points, name this game, the most recent tactical espionage mission of Solid Snake.

answer: {Hubble's} constant

In a matter-dominated universe, the square of this value is inversely proportional to the cosmological constant, and during cosmic inflation the scale factor was proportional to e to the power of this value multiplied by time. Taking the time derivative of this value and dividing by this value squared, adding one, and negating gives the deceleration parameter, while the square of this value appears one one side of the Friedman equation. Easily defined as the time derivative of the scale factor divided by the scale factor, one over this value is approximately equal to the age of the universe. For 10 points, name this proportionality parameter between an object's distance and its redshift, named for an American astronomer.

answer: Alfred {Tarksi}

A Olshanskii managed to prove that one mathematical object named for this figure exists, and that object is used as a counterexample to Burnsides problem and is a group with every subgroup being cyclic with prime order. His namesake plank problem looks at coverings of convex objects in n-dimensional Euclidean space, and one problem posited by him asks whether the real numbers with the exponential function is decidable. This man created an axiomatization of the real numbers, and attempted to resolve the liar paradox by distinguishing an object language from a metalanguage, known as his namsake truth definition. A more famous concept named for this man was originally derived from the Vitali set, and shows that bounded subsets of 3-D Euclidean space with non-empty interiors are equidecomposable. For 10 points, name this Polish mathematician who names a paradox about breaking apart and reassembling a sphere with Banach.

This figure's companion constantly said “let others decide” at a series of negotiations when this figure wasn't present, leading to this figure's demise; however, his remains were embalmed with herbs. A companion of Hoenir, he is consulted for a final time immediately before Ragnarok, and the figure that consulted him previously sacrificed an eye to his well.

This man claimed that the United States was dominated by what he termed as "the music of slaves" in his essay "On Jazz."

One of his works claims that  "Life does not live," and that toys are subjugating; that book seeks to explain how to live correctly and is titled Minima Moralia. At the beginning of one of his works, this man claims that philosophy is still necessary because the time to realise it was missed. That work is Negative Dialectics, but in a better-known work, this philosopher wrote about the homogenizing effects of pop culture and claimed that high art and culture was threatened by the tyranny of identity.  For ten points, identify this philosopher, a member of the Frankfurt school, who along with Max Horkheimer wrote The Dialectics of Enlightenment.

answer: {telomerase} [or {telomerase reverse transcriptase}; or {hTERT}]

ITAS is a semi-quantitative assay used to study the activity of this enzyme; that assay improves upon the PCR based TRAP assay which is used to detect the activity of this enzyme. The ability of this enzyme to access its substrate can be regulated by a complex wherein the TIN2 protein tethers the TPP1/POT1 proteins to the TRF1/TRF2 proteins; that complex is called the shelterin complex. Compounds that stabilize the formation of a G-Tetrad help inhibit the activity of this enzyme. Much like DNA polymerase, it possesses thumb, palm, and finger domains, and expression of this enzymes makes cells immortal and helps them bypass the Hayflick limit. For 10 points, identify this enzyme whose discovery resolved the end-replication problem, and which lengthens namesake regions of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes.

A theory of this concept, developed by Van Valin and Foley, borrows heavily from the work of David Dowty and is characterized by the use of lexical decomposition and thematic role distinction. That system of termed Role and Reference [this], while Paul Smolensky proposed a Harmonic variety. Lucien Tresniere developed a variety of this which does not utilize phrase nodes, making it ideal for languages with no set word order such as Czech. The Operator variety of this is a subset of that type, which is known as Dependency [this]. A more famous explication of this concept arises from the Minimalist Program, analyses this on the basis of a deep and a surface structure, and was first proposed in the work Syntactic Structures. For ten points, identify this concept which exists in a transformational-generative variety, and which some theorists claim is innate to humans in the Universal variety.
