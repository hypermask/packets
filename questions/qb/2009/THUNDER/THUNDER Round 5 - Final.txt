answer: Hydrogen {bonding}

In the Zimm-Bragg model, these interactions are responsible for moving molecules from the C state to the H state, and a double version of this phenomenon was discovered by Brown and Haseltine between certain metallic compounds and acidic groups. A bifurcated form of this phenomenon is present when two centers are involved, while a carbonylated aza-crown ether will show the low-barrier type of them. Histidine stabilizes O2 in a bent position above the porphyrin ring of hemoglobin using them. This interaction is responsible for the dimerization of carboxylic acids and the negative azeotropy of hydrogen flouride solutions, and their increased occurence in GC-rich DNA gives those segments their stability. Its responsible for giving alpha helices their shape, and also grants water its high boiling point. For 10 points, name this non-covalent interaction in which an electronegative acceptor pulls on a donor containing a namesake atom.

answer: Keratin

Dane's method is used to stain both mucin and this molecule, and this protein mediates cell polarity by binding to Albatross protein and the apical junction complex. Its aggregation is triggered by filaggrin in one organ, and this protein is prevalent in the stratum lucidum and stratum corneum of one structure. Mutations in the 5th or 14th isoforms of this protein leads to EBS, and it is attached to desmoplakin in on the one face of desmosomes. This protein contains a long alpha-helix flanked by disordered domains, and acidic and basic isoforms of it dimerize, and the dimers proceed to form tetramers which arrange in fibrils. Its structure is formed by crosslinking of cysteine , and it is the main component of type 1 intermediate filaments. For 10 points, name this structural protein that gives strength to skin, hair and nails.
