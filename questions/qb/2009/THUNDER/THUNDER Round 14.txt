Although it is not The Rite of Spring, it was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev and premiered under the baton of Pierre Monteux, with Nijinsky playing one of the leads. The orchestration requires, in addition to the standard forces, a wordless choir.

Chronic nephritis has been found to be associated with mutations in the gene for Claudin-16, which facilitates paracellular transport of this substance. In bacteria, the CorA protein is used for transmembrane transport of it, and complexes identified in humans for transport of this substance include SLC41 and TRPM6. Low blood levels of this element may result when chemotherapy drugs like Cisplatin are administered, and preeclampsia can also lower levels of it. The presence of this element helps initiate the Calvin cycle when it binds the active site of RuBisCO.
