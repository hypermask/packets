answer: {Sonic} Hedgehog Homolog or {SHH}

This protein's secretion by RGC cells is responsible for retinal patterning, and the You/Scube2 protein in D. Rerio is responsible for controlling its extracellular distribution. This protein is inhibited by cyclopamine and robotnikin, and its C-terminal domain functions as an intein by cleaving itself and transferring a cholesterol, while its N-terminal portion is palmitoylated. This protein is expressed in the Zone of Polarizing Activity of developing limb buds, and its expression in the notochord triggers its expression in the floor plate of the neural tube. Mutations in it lead to type 3 holoprosencephaly, and it activates the GLI class of transcription factors by depressing SMO via binding to the PTCH receptor.
