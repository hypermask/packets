answer: {Simon Magus} [accept {Simon} the {Magician}, {Simon} the {Sorcerer} or {Simon Gitta}]

Some of this figure's disciples were said to have been Marcion of Pontus and Menander from Capparetea who deceived many in Antioch. According to Chapter 26 of the First Apology of Justin Martyr, this figure for whom a statue was erected “on the river Tiber between two bridges” was not trusted by Christians. Eusebius claims that the revealer of The Three Steles of Seth, Dosithesus, was this figure's teacher, and this figure is often associated with Helena, an ostensible incarnation of the Mother Goddess. Born in Gitta, the primary biblical account of this figure comes from Acts 8, where he offers to pay Peter and John so that he too may have the power of the Holy Spirit through the laying of hands. Called “the Father of All Heresies” and often accused of being possessed by demons and levitating at will, for 10 points, name this first century Samaritan proto-Gnostic wizard whose name is lent to the crime of paying for holy offices.

In cases where this policy was lacking or nonexistent, the practice of taqiyya was often used for protection by concealing one's identity. Although this principle was advocated by Pope Alexander II, he sanctioned the War of Barbastro which ended in a massacre that defied it. This principle was upheld in the sixty-seven articles of the Capitulation of Granada regarding Moriscos, which was signed by Boabdil, but it was largely ignored after Cardinal Talavera's replacement by Cardinal Cisneros. Tomas de Torquemada was one of the chief opponents of this principle, and the Alhambra Decree was another step back in achieving this policy, because through it, Ferdinand and Isabella expelled Jews from their country. For 10 points, name this policy which was severely lacking in Iberia during the Spanish Inquisition.

answer: {Quantum Electrodynamics} or {QED}

This theory predicts the existence of both a u-channel diagram and t-channel diagram in Moller scattering. Its gauge group is isomorphic to the circle group, and the use of renormalization to remove divergences in this theory was formulated by Dyson, who also showed the equivalence of its operator and diagram forms. Precision tests of it involve checking the correlation between independent calculations of the fine structure constant, and this theory is used to explain the deviation of the electron's magnetic moment from 2. It predicts virtual electron-positron pair production as the source of vacuum polarization, and one-loop effects in it give rise to the Lamb shift. Charged particles exchange photons in, for 10 points, name this extremely accurate abelian gauge theory developed by Schwinger, Tomonaga, and Feynman.

The superconducting Chevrel phase adopts this geometry, whose stability complex for formation can be found form the Irving-Williams series. They can isomerize via a reaction that forces them through a C-sub-2v intermediate or a D-sub-3h intermediate. Besides undergoing the Ray-Dutt or Bailar twists, their ligands can be arranged facially or meridonally. Werner complexes exhibit this formation, whose orbitals can be divided into the t-sub-2g and e-sub-g sets due to crystal field splitting. One of their axes may elongate to break degeneracy in the classic Jahn-Teller effect, and this geometry occurs in sulfur hexafloride, molybdenum hexacarbonyl, or any complex with no lone pairs and six ligands according to VSEPR theory. For 10 points, name this moleculer geometry which resembles an eight-faced solid.

One protein associated with this disease has been shown to selectively activate Death Receptor 6 in the cells most heavily affected, and that protein is processed by PSEN1 and PSEN2. The ApoE4 allele is strongly associated with this disease, and Pick's disease has a similar mechanism. Galantamine and Donepezil are used to control this disease, which is partly associated with the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, which creates microtubule tangles. People with down syndrome invariably develop this disease by age 40, partly because they have an extra copy of the APP gene, which is thought to form beta-amyloid plaques. Characterized by the gradual loss of longterm memory and eventual severe dementia, for 10 points, name this chronic neurological illness, named for a German.

answer: {Fermat's little} theorem

A generalization of this theorem to polynomials is the basis for the Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena algorithm, and this theorem can be used to prove that the periodicity of the decimal representation of a prime-denominator fraction is some multiple of p-1. A combinatorial proof of it considers a bracelet with a string of symbols, while its more easily proven via group theory using Lagrange's theorem.
