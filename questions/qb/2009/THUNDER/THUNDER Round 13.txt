answer: {nuclear pores} [or {nuclear pore} complexes; prompt on {Nups} or {nucleoporins}]

The "reduction of dimensionality" model attempts to explain the selectivity of these structures. The assembly of these structures was first studied with the use of the chelator BAPTA and lectin WGA, and one model for their function involves the binding of the successive FG residues that line these complexes. These structures contain a molecule called the "center plug" and one end of these structures have a basket like shape. Hydrolysis of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP and dissociation of Ran-GDP with the help of Ran-GEF helps these structures perform their characteristic activity; that activity is performed with the aid of karyopherins called importins and exportins. For 10 points, identify these structures which are embedded in the envelope of a namesake organelle and which facilitate the transport of molecules between that DNA containing organelle and the cytosol.

Some of the ideas of this school of thought have been attacked in the work Never At War, which analyzed the Germany of Kaiser Wilhelm II as its case in point.  A notable member of this school of thought combined Steven Walt's Theory of Balance of Threat with another theorist's to create his own Balance of Interests Thoery; that man is Randall Schweller. Another theorist to write in this school of thought did so in his work on nuclear weapons and international security in the work The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, while another outlined this school in Theory of International Politics. Those men are John Mearsheimer and one who believes that the international system functions only as a check on behavior, Kenneth Waltz. For ten points, identify this school of international relations theory which sought to improve the model of Morgenthau and Niebuhr and which is opposed to Neo-Liberalism.

answer: {Paramagnetism}

One important constant describing these materials is proportional to the square of the Lande g-factor and the Bohr magneton times J times J plus 1. Molecular orbital theory is required to show that diatomic oxygen is one of these materials, and one law describing these materials contain an additional theta term describing exchange interactions. The Neel-Arrhenius law describes the “super” version of this property, which occurs in ferrofluids, and these materials obey the Curie-Weiss law. For 10 points, name these materials characterized by a magnetic susceptibility greater than 1, which become magnetised only in response to an external field.

answer: {Moraine}

A ribbed one of these structures is found near Lake Rogen, where that subtype gets its name. Veiki ones form irregular plateaued landscapes and are a subtype of Hummocky ones, and ribbon lakes can be created when they trap water, as occurred at Lake Zurich. The Giant's Wall in Norway is another example of these, and is of a subtype that marks the advancement of the structures responsible for creating them, known as terminal ones. Frost shattering can create lateral ones, while rolling hears can create ground ones, which can be formed into drumlins. For 10 points, name these physical features which are created by debris from glaciers as they advance.

answer: {Two Dogmas} of {Empiricism}

Scott Soames argued that this work depends on the idea that all a priori truths are also analytically true, while Strawson and Grice also notably critiqued this work. Midway through the first edition of this essay, the author notes that "But now we have abandoned the thought of any special realm of entities called meanings."This work borrows from Frege's example of a Morning and Evening star, and Russell's example of "Sir Walter Scott" and "The Author of Waverly" to explain the meaning of analytic naming and identity. One of the titular ideas of this work is the idea that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms that refers exclusively to immediate experience, or reductionism, and the other is the analytic-synthetic distinction.For ten points, identify this attack on logical positivism by W. V. O. Quine.

answer: {Gas} chromatography

One important value given by this technique is derived by considering the linear relationship between the log of t sub r and the number of carbon atoms, known as the Kovats retention index, and this technique commonly uses an autosampler and an injector in order to pass the sample through either a capillary column or a packed column. thermal conductivity detectors or flame ionization detectors are commonly used in this technique, which is often used immediately before a mass spectrometry experiment to separate a heterogenous sample. For 10 points, name this type of chromatography in which both phases are vaporized.
