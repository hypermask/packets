answer: {Oregon} Territory [or {Oregon Country}]

After the death of fur trapper Ewing Young, this region was left without a government until the Champoeg Meetings created the Organic Laws, which set up a provisional government. John McLoughlin is seen as the father of this region, and the Whitman Massacre here sparked the Cayuse War. Henry James Warre and Mervin Vavasour were sent to scout this region in case a war broke out over it, but it never came to that, although Lyman Cutler's shooting of an animal did spark the bloodless Pig War here. Missouri Senator Lewis Linn was a champion of annexing this region, and a dispute over the boundary of this region led to the slogan “Fifty-four Forty or Fight!” but James Polk settled for the 49th parallel as its northern border in an 1846 treaty with Great Britain. For 10 points, name this region of the Pacific Northwest, the namesake of a trail used by pioneers.

answer: {Tokamak}

A quasi-periodic relaxation in these devices is known as an Edge-Localized Mode and was first discovered in the ASDEX. These devices are specified by a set of three parameters; a ratio of pressures beta, a product of collision frequency and transit time v-star, and a ratio of radii rho-star. Heat is carried to the walls of these devices by free neutrons, and unlike z-pinches these devices are closed. Radio-frequency or neutral beam injection heating are used in these devices, some of which include the Alcator c-Mod and the future ITER. Originally concieved by Tamm and Sakharov, they use the Lorentz effect via a toroidal magnetic field. For 10 points, name these devices used to contain plasmas, important in fusion research.

answer: {Vandal}({s}) [or {Vandilii}]

One king of the Hasdingi tribe of these people was defeated by Hermeric, a king of the Suebi, after which he became a king of their Silingi tribe. These people incorporated the Alans into their kingdom, and their persecutions of Donatists, Manichaeans and Catholics contributed to their downfall. These people's first king, Godigisel, died shortly before he could lead them across the frozen Rhine River, and one of these peoples served as chief minister to Western Emperor Honorius, but Stilicho's inability to stop them from entering Roman territory caused his downfall in that position. The last king of these people, Gelimer, was defeated at the battles of Ad Decimum and Tricamarum by Belisaurius, after which their kingdom in North Africa was incorporated into the empire of Justinian. For 10 points, name this Germanic tribe which sacked Rome under Geiseric in 455.

answer: {Liver}

Along with the heart, this organ is severely damaged in Alagille syndrome, which results from the deletion of a gene coding for the JAG1 protein. The Child-Pugh scale is used to evaluate damage to this organ, which can also occur when veins leading to it are occluded in Budd-Chiari syndrome. Morrison's pouch lies behind this this organ, which is suspended by the coronary ligament. It is one of the major sites of damage as a result of copper accumulation in Wilson's disease, and it is attached to the diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall by the falciform ligament. Red blood cells are broken down in this organ by macrophages called Kupffer cells, and this organ receives blood through the portal vein system. For 10 points, identify this site of gluconeogenesis, a four-lobed, bile-secreting organ.

answer: Sultan {Suleiman} the Magnificent [or {Suleiman} I; or {Suleiman} the {Lawgiver}]

This ruler's physician Moses Hamon got him to denounce blood libels against Jews, and he had his concubine Mahidevran or Gulbahar banished for beating his wife. This ruler died of natural causes during the Siege of Szigetvar, at which a tiny Croatian force under Nikola Zrinski delayed his army of 100,000 for over a month. This ruler's Code of the Rayas lifted many of his subjects from serfdom, and together with his Grand Mufti Ebussuud he brought Qanun closer to Sharia.

answer: {Seven} Laws of {Noah} [accept {Noachide} or {Noahide Laws}]

Commentary discussions of their authority alternates between two terms: she-niztavvu and she-kibbelu aleihem. Maimondes claims that only divine authority and revelation to Moses constitutes the proper basis for acceptance of these. It is argued that the principle of “dina demalkhuta dina” only applies within the context of their framework and thus Jewish marital law is outside its jurisdiction. The Tosefta claims four possible additions to these, including the magical practices described in Deuteronomy 18, while the tannaitic sources indicate a complete lack of agreement to their proper enumeration. He who accepts its obligations is referred to as ger-toshav or “resident-stranger,” and only one of these derives exegetical support from outside Genesis 2:16. That one places an injunction on the eating of flesh of live animals, and the only positively formulated one establishes a requirement to have just Laws. For 10 points, name this set of 7 ethical duties which according to rabbinic tradition binds all of mankind and is named after the final antediluvian Prophet.

He's not Edvard Munch, but this figure created a self-portrait in which a skeleton clutches his shoulder. He depicted one of the title creatures holding a rock over his head in his Battle of the Centaurs, while in a more peaceful scene he showed a Centaur in the Village Blacksmith's Shop. He showed a satyr playing a flute between two columns in his Idyll, and painted a black-clad figure holding a scythe and riding a dragon in The Plague. Two white-clad figures kneel before an altar medial to a procession in his The Sacred Wood. He painted five different views of his most notable work, which has eerily-lit straight cliffs and two figures in a boat rowing to the title location, presumably to deliver a coffin. For 10 points, name this Swiss painter of Isle of the Dead.

answer: {E2} or Bimolecular elimination before mention

The deuterium isotope effect for this reaction mechanism is greater than one, and in a cyclohexane ring this reaction can only occur when the substituents are trans diaxial. Originally elucidated by Christopher Ingold, one reaction that obeys a similar mechanism occurs after an exhaustive methylation step. It only occurs when the substituents are coplanar and is much faster when they are antiperiplanar, and is a concerted mechanism with an sp3 hybridized carbon transforming to sp2 in one step. For 10 points, name this reaction mechanism that occurs with bulky bases, whose name stands for bimolecular elimination.

The Incan god of this was the chief priest of the moon god Coniraya, and one Shinto diety of this phenomenon cried so loudly at birth that he had to be sailed around Japan to calm him down. The Chinese diety of this phenomenon acquired his powers after eating from a heavenly peach tree, and has claws, bat wings, and a birds beak. Along with his bag-carrying brother, another god of this lost a protracted battle with 33 gods and has a companion who hides in the navels of children.

This man's namesake convolution theorem is used to relate arithmetic functions by summing over divisors, and he sometimes lends his name to the indicator function of the rationals. One result named for this man is used to prove the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem, and applies the pidgeonhole principle to make a blunt diophantine approximation, while another theorem named for him is complementary to the Green-Tao theorem and requires this mathematicians' namesake L-series to prove. In addition to that theorem on the arithmetic progression of primes, this mathematician is more famous for a simple type of boundary condition on the solutions of differential equations. For 10 points, name this French mathematician and number theorist, who also came up with the pidgeonhole principle.

answer: The {Chrysanthemum} and the {Sword}: Patterns of Japanese Culture

One section in this work describes the way that pleasure is seen as an evil to be rooted out of one's breast, but contradictorily claims that the subjects of this work are not Puritans, because they do not neglect the cultivation of desire, which is done as a fine art. That section of this work further cites the influence of Percival Lowell's description of plunging oneself into a bath of cold water for cultivation of artificial austerity. Both of those anecdotes appear in the section of this work titled The Circle of Human Feelings, while another section describes the propensity of its subjects to sleep in any situation at all. An important distinction in this work is drawn between guilt and shame cultures. Another important section of this work details the relationship between true feelings and façade, which are termed honne and tatemae. For ten points, name this study of the subtitular Patterns of Japanese Culture, written by Ruth Benedict.
