answer: S phase [accept {synthesis} phase]

Its namesake index of viability looks at incorporation of deoxy-bromo-uridine, which can only be done during this phase.

It features the action of enzymes like topoisomerase, helicase, and polymerase, which leads to the formation of sister chromatids and twice the quantity of a cell's DNA.
