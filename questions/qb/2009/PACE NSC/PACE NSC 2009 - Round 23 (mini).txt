His presidency saw the arrival of the Statue of Liberty, and he sent federal troops to crush the Pullman Strike.

answer: the {Sacco}-{Vanzetti} Trial [accept the execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, accept word logical equivalents, prompt on Braintree {murder} until mentioned]

One figure involved in this event had been absent from his job at the Three-K shoe factory, purportedly to get a passport, and after this event the American embassy in Paris was bombed and another bomb was intercepted in Lisbon. Fred Moore, a habitual cocaine addict, had the plan to make the proceedings as political as possible, and he eventually enlisted the aid of the New England Civil Liberties Union. Four decades after this event, tests at the Massachusetts police labs confirmed that Bullet Three had been fired by one of the participants' guns. The prosecutor Frederick Katzman's closing line "Stand together, you men of Norfolk!" played upon the jury's fear in the wake of the red scare.

For 10 points, name this vector quantity, the derivative of angular momentum, which, given constant moment of inertia, causes angular acceleration and which is equivalent to the cross product of position and force, making it the rotational analogue of force.
