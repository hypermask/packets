answer: {reduction} [do not accept “redox”]

One of these types of reactions sees the formation of a hydrazone intermediate and has a Huang-Minlon modification. In addition to the Wolff-Kishner version performed on ketones, more common examples include conversions of aldehydes to alcohols in the presence of lithium aluminum hydride and the conversion of permanganate ion to a manganate ion, which results in an additional overall negative charge. For 10 points, identify this type of reaction exemplified by the addition of hydrogens or removal of oxygens from a molecule, which is often coupled with an oxidation.

answer: {precession}

Llewellyn Thomas has a relativistic type of this phenomenon named for him and in general relativity a form of this occurs when a small body orbits a large rotating one, called frame dragging or the Lense-Thirring effect. General relativity can also explain this process for the perihelion of mercury and the Larmor type is when the magnetic moment does not stay in the direction of the magnetic field. Occurring when torque is applied to a spinning object and related to nutation, this is, for 10 points, what motion of the spin axis of an object demonstrated in a spinning top.

Galois representations were used to show that every elliptical curve has a modular form proving a special case of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, which implies this statement regarding the solvability of a Diophantine equation involving the addition of a to the n and b to the n to yield c to the n.
