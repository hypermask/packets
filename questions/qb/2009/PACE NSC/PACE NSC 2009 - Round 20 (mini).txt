After this figure was torn apart, the first pomegranate tree grew from his blood. His grand-mother Rhea caused the murder of Dryas by driving his father Lycurgus mad after Lycurgus denied this god's divinity. He was once captured by pirates who intended to sell him into slavery; he escaped by turning them into dolphins.

This god was then delivered from Zeus's thigh and was followed by the Maenads. For 10 points, name this Greek god from Asia, the son of Semele and the Greek god of wine.

Chaperone proteins such as Hsp104 aid in the propagation of URE3 and PSI, which are examples of these in yeast. They are resistant to degradation by proteases and are produced by mutations in the gene encoding for the PrP protein, which results in them possessing beta-sheets instead of alpha helices. They are known to cause a rare inheritable disease associated with sleeplessness and ultimately death, fatal familial insomnia. Also causing Creutszfeld-Jacobs disease in humans, these are, for 10 points, what entities which earned Stanly Prusiner the 1997 Nobel Prize for his discovery of these infectious proteins linked with kuru and mad cow disease.

answer: {Sinners} in the {Hands} of an {Angry God}

Its immediate impact was overshadowed by a controversy surrounding its creator's theories on “bodily effects,” which drew the ire of Charles Chauncy. It begins by quoting the verse “their foot shall slide in due time” and consists of ten considerations, the final of which notes that one titular figure is under no obligations. Closing with a command to “now awake and fly” from the consequences of being “out of Christ,” it may have inspired a trip to Cambuslang by George Whitfield and was first delivered in Enfield, Connecticut. For 10 points, identify this prominent example of “fire and brimstone” preaching, a 1741 sermon by Jonathan Edwards that became the most famous of the Great Awakening.
