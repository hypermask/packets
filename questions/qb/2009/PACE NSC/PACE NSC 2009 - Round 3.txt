answer: {Doppler} effect or shift [accept {transverse Doppler effect} before “{transverse}”]

Rician fading, a stochastic process describing self-cancellation of radio waves, is partially caused by this phenomenon, a form of which was used to confirm time dilation by the Ives-Stillwell experiment.

For 10 points, name this effect, the shift in frequency of a wave for a moving source or observer, exemplified by ambulance sirens and the radar used to determine weather patterns.
