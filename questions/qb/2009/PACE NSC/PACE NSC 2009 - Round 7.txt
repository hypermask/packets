answer: Republic of {Zimbabwe}

In this country, Roy Bennet was jailed for “disrupting state affairs” after being kicked in the head repeatedly by Anti-Corruption Minister Didymus Mutasa, and again in 2009 as part of a campaign targeting the Movement for Democratic Change, whose leader was involved in a suspicious car accident in March that left his wife dead. Morgan Tsvangirai serves as this country's Prime Minister, but has had little opportunity to reverse ZANU-PF policies, such as seizing all white-owned farms, that have helped prompt its astronomical inflation rate. For 10 points, name this country currently mismanaged by Robert Mugabe, whose capital is Harare.

answer: Robert {Herrick}

This author wrote a poem in which a “lawn about the shoulders thrown” is a woman's feature that bewitches the speaker more than when she is “too precise in every part,” while another of his poems begins, “Get up, get up for shame, the blooming morn / Upon her wings presents the god unshorn.” In addition to writing “Delight in Disorder” and “Corinna's Going A-Maying” found in his collection Hesperides, he wrote a poem “Old time is still a-flying / And this same flower that smiles to-day / To-morrow will be dying.” For 10 points, name this English Cavalier poet, who wrote “Gather ye rosebuds while ye may” in “To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time.”

answer: special {relativity} [prompt on {relativity}; do not accept “{general relativity}”]

The Klein-Gordon equation is an extension of the Schrodinger equation incorporating this theory, calculations of which are simplified in Minkowski space. One of its consequences is the pole vaulter's paradox, where a running vaulter can fit a pole entirely within a barn smaller than the pole, and another considers that a man moving in a space ship will age more slowly than his twin at rest. For 10 points, identify this theory wherein one may change frames using Lorentz transformations to calculate length contraction, which suggests that observations of motion depend on the frame in which they are measured as proposed by Einstein.

answer: The {Affluent Society}

This work argues that raises in average wages have led luxury goods to be considered costumer “needs” in what is called the “dependence effect,” and it uses the term “social balance” to refer to the proper relationship between private and public spending. It advocates an increase in public spending in education to help foster a “new class” of workers who enjoy their jobs. Originally titled “Why the Poor are Poor,” this work forms a trilogy with its author's other books American Capitalism and The New Industrial State and introduces the term “conventional wisdom.” For 10 points, name this book reevaluating the American economy, by John Galbraith.

answer: Johann {Pachelbel} [or Bachelbel]

He wrote a work that includes the F minor aria Sebaldina, and he composed 95 fugues based on a Magnificat. Along with Praise to the Lord In His Sanctuary, he composed six airs and variations on them in six different keys in his The Hexachord of Apollo. His most famous work has a repeated basso continuo playing D, A, B, F sharp, G, D, G, A, and the other three voices enter on F sharp descending the D major scale to A. That work was paired with a gigue, and is a misnamed passacaglia. For 10 points, name this German composer of his namesake Canon in D.

answer: {ultraviolet catastrophe} [prompt on {Rayleigh}-{Jeans catastrophe}]

It arose from the combination of the statement that all modes of a system at equilibrium have an average energy of kT/2, suggested by the equipartition theorem, with the predictions of the Rayleigh-Jeans law. This suggested there was no peak wavelength on the associated intensity-wavelength curve according to classical mechanics, but Planck's introduction of quantized energies resolved this paradox. For 10 points, identify this prediction of classical mechanics asserting that an ideal black-body could emit infinite energy at sufficiently short wavelengths, which give this phenomenon its name.

One ruler with this name was the son of Halfdan the Black, who pledged he would neither wash nor shave his hair until he had unified his country, which he accomplished after beating Kjotve the Rich of Agder. A king of Denmark with this name was deposed by his son Sweyn Forkbeard, while another joined the Varangian guard and became the “scourge of Bulgaria” before falling at Stamford Bridge. Kings with this name earned the epithets “Bluetooth” and “Hardrade,” as well as “Harefoot” and “Godwinson” in England. For 10 points, identify this name sported by the last Anglo-Saxon King of England, who lost at Hastings to William the Conqueror.

The effete Anthony Blanche interrupts the protagonist's art show featuring his latest series of paintings of Latin American ruins. This novel's first book is called “Et in Arcadia Ego” and the second book begins when the protagonist leaves his sick wife Celia to sleep in their room during a stormy cruise so he can begin an affair with Rex Mottram's wife, which only ends when the deathbed conversion of Lord Marchmain convinces Julia Flyte to end it.

answer: {Snell's} law [accept {Descartes's law}; prompt on {law} of {diffraction}]

This relationship predicts the existence of creep waves, which are less useful than Rayleigh waves for nondestructive testing. The boundary conditions of Maxwell's equations, along with Fermat's principle of least time, may be used to derive it, and a quantity named for Brewster can be calculated from this law assuming complete reflection. Involved in the derivation of the critical angle, this relationship predicts an angle of fifty degrees will produce total internal reflection at a water-air boundary. For 10 points, identify this relationship which determines how the angle at which light enters and exits a boundary changes due change in refractive index.

Project PAMELA discovered an abundance of these particles while orbiting the Earth in 2008, though the theory of cosmic strings might explain the result. FDG is a radioactive tracer whose emission of these particles results in annihilation, and the resulting gamma rays feature in a medical imaging technique named for them. They were predicted as a consequence of the Dirac equation, and their existence was proven by sending cosmic rays through a cloud chamber leading to diverging beams of charged particles, a result explainable by antimatter. For 10 points, identify this particle discovered by Carl Anderson, an anti-electron usually written as e-plus.
