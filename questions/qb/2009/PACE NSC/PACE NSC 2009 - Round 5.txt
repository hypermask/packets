answer: {Brown} v. {Board} of Education of Topeka

1924 election loser John W. Davis unsuccessfully argued a portion of this case that saw the Clark testimony, Briggs v. Elliott. Fred Vinson's successor allowed the controversial phrase “all deliberate speed” to govern enforcement of this case, possibly in order to secure a 9-0 majority, which helped prompt the characterization of that man's appointment as a “damned-fool mistake” by Dwight Eisenhower. Bolling v. Sharpe was also combined into, for 10 points, what early decision by the Warren Court which overturned Plessy v. Ferguson by striking down separate but equal schools in 1954.

answer: Alan Matheson {Turing}

In a dissertation, this man independently proved the central limit theorem using the Gaussian error function and later showed that Lie groups could be approximated from finite groups. He determined that no solution exists to determine whether a given program-input combination will terminate, thus deeming the halting problem undecidable. Any computable function can be computed by constructs like the “busy beaver” and other such machines in a certain thesis named for Church and this man. For 10 points, name this British computer scientist, who lends his name to a test for computer intelligence applicable to his namesake machines.

answer: Carl Ransom {Rogers}

This man received his first professorship after publishing Clinical Treatment of the Problem Child. His views on the ideal form of student-centric education were espoused in his Freedom to Learn, which was published before a work discussing “marriage and its alternatives” entitled Becoming Partners. This main outlined what he called “the good life”, a state in which an organism continually seeks their full potential in his On Becoming a Person, and he developed a form of humanistic psychiatrist-patient interaction that emphasizes unconditional positive regard. For 10 points, name this American psychologist and developer of client-centered therapy.

answer: Le {Chatelier's} principle

One application of this statement is the removal of water by Dean-Stark distillation in a Fischer esterification. The van't Hoff principle explains its thermodynamic results. The solubility of a compound can decrease as a result of the common ion effect, resulting in precipitation as predicted by this statement, and in a thermodynamic sense, it explains why exothermic reactions produce more product when temperature is decreased. Also explaining why more product forms when additional reactant is added at equilibrium, for 10 points, identify this principle which states that an equilibrium will shift to accommodate any changes, named for a French chemist.

The Feynman amplitude is a Fourier transform of the Yukawa type of this, and the mathematical formulation of another approximates combined effects of Pauli repulsion and van der Waals forces. That one is named for Lennard-Jones, and a corollary to Stokes's theorem explains that the gradients of these fields must be state functions and therefore conservative forces. The electric type of this is given as U divided by q or by kq divided by r for a distance r from a charged particle. For 10 points, give this term which names a kind of energy coming in gravitational and elastic varieties.

answer: {Arrhenius} Equation

A stretched exponential form of this equation is useful in cases involving variable range hopping, and one theoretical basis for it comes from the Trautz-Lewis theory. A modification of this equation has a constant of proportionality equal to Boltzmann's constant divided by Planck's constant and is based on the transition state theory of Eyring and Polyani. One quantity in this equation is equal to the product of the collision frequency and steric factor, which multiplies an exponent of activation energy. For 10 points, name this equation developed by a Swedish chemist that gives the rate of a reaction based on the activation energy.

This chemical is metabolized into HIAA, and receptor antagonists for this compound include mirtazipine and risperidone. It is collected in blood platelets and enterochromaffin cells of the GI tract, but the main source of it in the brain is the Raphe nucleus.

The Roothan equations are an alternative to the most common method of describing these entities using a non-orthonormal basis. They are eigenvalues of the Fock operator in the Hartree-Fock method for determining them. A way of mathematically describing these entities is by linearly combining their substituent atomic parts in the LCAO method, and they are often visualized by van der Waals surfaces. Coming in bonding and anti-bonding forms, for 10 points, identify these constructs specifying regions of electron density in combinations of atoms, the namesakes of the primary alternative to VSEPR (VES-per) theory.
