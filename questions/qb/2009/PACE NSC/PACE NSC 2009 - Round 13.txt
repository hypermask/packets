answer: {learned helplessness}

Peterson explained variations in this phenomenon using attribution theory. Lefcourt related it to a shift in the locus of control, and another experiment testing it had babies attempt to control a mobile and was done by Finkelstein and Ramey. The original experiment testing it was followed up by another one using curare, and the subjects in the third group showed signs of clinical depression. That first experiment was conducted with the help of Overmeier, and involved yolking and shocking dogs. For 10 points, name this behavior in which an organism doesn't move away from a negative stimulus even when they can, originally shown by Seligman.

answer: {alveoli}

Along with the glomerulus, these structures are destroyed in Goodpasture's Syndrome, and one group of cells in these structures malfunctions in hyaline membrane disease. Laplace's Law is used to model these structures, which are separated from each other by Kohn's Pores. Usually coated by surfactants, the walls of these units break down in emphysema. They are located at the termini of the bronchioles and serve as the interface between the respiratory and circulatory system. For 10 points, name these small sacs in the lung, the site of gas exchange.

answer: equilibrium or saturation {vapor pressure} [prompt on partial answer]

Some methods for computing this quantity include the Lee-Kesler correlation, the Wagner functions, and the DIPRR equation, and one method of measuring it uses a Knudsen Cell. The Arden-Buck and Goff-Gratch equations are used to compute this quantity for water, and comparing this quantity between different components gives the relative volatility. For an ideal mixture, it is dependent upon the mole fraction of each component, and the boiling point is defined as when this equals atmospheric pressure. For 10 points, name this value calculated by Raoult's Law, the pressure at which a gas is in equilibrium with its liquid and solid phases.

answer: Kingdom of {Jerusalem}

The first legal code of this kingdom was replaced by namesake Assizes under Amalric II. It commissioned the Melisende Psalter, and its major defensive projects were the castles of Montreal, Ibelin, and Kerak. Established after the Battle of Ramla, it nearly fell after a major failure by Conrad III and Louis VII. Reaching an apex with a victory at Montsigard by brilliant but leprous king Baldwin IV, it was ruined by the idiots Raynard de Chatillon and Guy de Lusignan.

This monarch's Giselle supplied Bavarian knights who helped him defeat Koppany near Pannonhalma Abbey, where Astrik was installed by his father Geza. His country's constitution was named for an item he received from Sylvester II, the Holy Crown, while his decaying hand remains one of his country's most important relics.

answer: deterministic {chaos} [prompt on {butterfly effect} or {clear}-{knowledge} equivalents before it's mentioned]

This phenomenon is not possible in planar, finite, continuous dynamics due to the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem. Given mixing and density properties, it corresponds to a Lyapunov exponent with positive real part because it is typified by exponential divergence in time of initially close trajectories. The long-time behavior of all trajectories in systems exhibiting this behavior is typified by fractals to which all points in state space converge, termed strange attractors. Partially arising due to the butterfly effect, for 10 points, name this type of behavior which is deterministic but difficult to predict, in contrast with stochastic behavior.

answer: {nirvana} [accept {nibbana}]

This concept involves removing one's avidia, and its name may come from the Sanskrit for “blowing off one's stench.” It is thought to have as many as seven names, one of which is “amala-consciousness.” In Jainism, it occurs after the death of an Arhat, though it is thought of as occurring for bhikshus as well in other religions. To Hindus, this is associated with moksha, and it is when one reaches this state that both dukkha and samsara cease. For 10 points, identify this Buddhist concept, the liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

answer: First {Opium} War [do not accept “{Second Opium War},” {obviously}]

The difficulty of combat in the Bocca Tigris during this conflict prompted one side to seak the supplemental Treaty of the Bogue. A need to reverse the drainage of silver exports and Charles Elliot's attempts to assert authority in Kowloon over crewmen of the Carnatic helped trigger this conflict, which began with the construction of a lime pit near Humen and a confiscation initiative by Lin Zexu. Agreements at Tientsin, Whampoa, Aigun, and Wangxia became the first of the “unequal treaties” along with the pact ending this conflict, the Treaty of Nanking. For 10 points, identify this war between Britain and Qing China, an early clash over the namesake narcotic.

answer: {Brownian} motion

Ornstein and Uhlenbeck included a term for inertia to improve a previous model for it which was not root mean square differentiable at t = 0. That model was developed by Paul Langevin. Its trajectory is always continuous but never differentiable, which makes it a Wiener process. The observation of mastic particles allowed Jean Perrin to use this process to calculate Avogadro's constant, and it was more famously characterized by Albert Einstein with the kinetic theory of gases. For 10 points, identify this process characterized by the random motion of small particles, named after a Scottish biologist who observed pollen undergoing it.

answer: {Huntington's} disease or {chorea}

Patients suffering from the X-linked McLeod neuro-acanthocytosis syndrome show similar symptoms to those of this disease. Its namesake protein binds to Hip1 and dynamin, and plays a role in vesicle trafficking. This disease occurs when 36 or more CAG repeats occur on its namesake gene on chromosome 4, resulting in glutamine amino acid repeats. Its patients exhibit the triad of repetitive movements, memory loss, and changes in personality. For 10 points, identify this neurodegenerative disease named for an American scientist, whose patients usually begin to exhibit symptoms when they are around 40 years old.

This action was overseen by Bertram Ramsey from Dover Castle, and after it, plans were made for Operation Rutter, which eventually became the disastrous Dieppe Raid. In the wake of this action, the promise to “outlive the menace of tyranny...if necessary alone” was made in a speech that also promised “we shall fight on the beaches,” though Churchill also cautioned that “wars are not won by” actions similar to this one. For 10 points, name this operation, codenamed Dynamo, a mass evacuation from the namesake French port that miraculously saved a vast portion of the British army from the advancing Germans in 1940.

Lemare transcribed this piece for pipe organ, as did Vladimir Horowitz for piano, and its original instrumentation ends with an oboe sustaining an octave to represent a cock's crow, followed by scales to represent scurrying. Based on a text by Henri Cazalis, this piece requires one string of a solo violin to be tuned a half-step low in order to play E flat and A tritones. For 10 points, identify this piece which begins with twelve repetitions of a harp playing D, signifying a clock striking midnight, and in which, like in Fossils, a xylophone is used to represent the jangling bones of skeletons that have left their graves, a work by Camille Saint-Saëns.

This river rises out of a bog near Kalene Hill before meeting the Shire, its last great tributary. Its largest tributary is the Kafue River, it includes the Ngonye Falls, and after it flows through thr Sesheke Plain, it is joined by the Cuando River. The Kariba and Cahora Bassa dams lie on it, and it enters the Barotse Plain after flowing over the Chavuma Falls. This river flows along the Eastern tip of the Caprivi Strip where it runs roughly parallel to the Okavango, and empties near Chinde into the Indian Ocean. For 10 points, identify this river which flows along much of the Zambia-Zimbabwe border, a Southern African river that creates Victoria Falls.
