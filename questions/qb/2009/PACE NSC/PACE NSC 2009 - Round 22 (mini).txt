answer: cerebrospinal fluid [or {CSF}]

High concentrations of proline in this substance can increase the rate of glutamate release.  This substance is produced by and circulated via the ependymal cells of the choroid plexus. It is typically found in the subarachnoid space, and arachnoid villi are sites of its reabsorption. Increased white blood cell count in this substance can indicate Gullain-Barré syndrome, and testing this liquid is one half of the diagnostic procedure for encephalitis. For 10 points, identify this fluid, the target of a lumbar puncture, a procedure colloquially known as a “spinal tap.”

answer: Constantine

One ruler by this name overcame the rebellion of Perbundus and was victorious at the naval Battle of Syllaeum. Another ruler of this name defeated his rival at the Battle of Chrysopolis, while yet another defeated Artabasdus early in his reign and was reportedly responsible for the death of Stephen the Younger. That emperor was the subject of a prophecy when Germanus witnessed him defecate in his baptismal font, and thus gained the nickname Copronymous. The most famous one issued the Edict of Milan and was written about by Eusebius. For ten points, give this name of the winner at the Battle of Milvian Bridge, the first Christian Roman emperor.

During his later career, he was nearly removed from power by his monarch during the Day of Dupes due to the protestations of Marie de Medici. He had Henri, duc of Montmorenci and governor of Languedoc executed after a insurrection instigated by Gaston of Orleans, and the only other plot against him was that of Cinq Mars. He rebuilt the Sorbonne and founded the French Academy, and he used royal agents called intendants to control the provinces.

answer: {drag} [prompt on {resistance}]

The Carpenter number gives the ratio of the effects of this phenomenon to those of inertia; a dimensionless quantity more often used to characterize this behavior generally varies as one over the fluid velocity at low Reynolds number and is equal to unity in the case of total stagnation. Its theoretic absence in potential flow is a paradox named for d'Alambert, which led to the theory of viscous boundary layers largely to explain this force. Causing damping in a harmonic oscillator underwater, for 10 points, name this force that varies as the relative flow speed squared times a namesake coefficient and that opposes the motion of a solid body through a fluid.
