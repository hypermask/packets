answer: {ultraviolet} light [accept UV; accept UVA until “form”] do not accept “sunlight”]

Avobenzone is one of the best-known retardants of this entity. One form of it causes thymine dimers to form in DNA, and it is often used on ethidium bromide-stained gels following electrophoresis.

For 10 points, name this part of the spectrum just shorter than visible with wavelengths 10 to 400 nanometers, a part of sunlight causing sunburns, which is blocked by the ozone layer.
