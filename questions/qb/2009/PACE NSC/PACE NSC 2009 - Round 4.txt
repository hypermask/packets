answer: The Mahdi [or {Muhammed Ahmad ibn Sayyid Abd Allah}]

This figure replaced zakat with state tax and hajj with jihad in his new regime, which saw his successor kill Yohannes IV at the Battle of Metemma. Using his fellow Baqqarans as a base, this man used his characteristic Hadendoa troops at the Battle of Abu Klea, although his gains were nullified when a gun flotilla helped Kitchener win the Battle of Omdurman. Most infamously, he displayed “Chinese” Gordon's severed head after besieging Khartoum. For 10 points, identify this leader of a revolt in Sudan, whose title indicates his belief that he was the promised savior of Islam.

answer: {Hubble} constant or {parameter}

Assuming the validity of the lambda-CDM model, in which dark matter is exclusively slow and non-baryonic, this quantity is calculable from observing the associated microwave shifts in the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The square of its time-dependent form is related to the time derivative of the scale factor over the scale factor in one of the Friedmann solutions to Einstein's field equations. The current value for this constant was obtained from the WMAP mission's study of the cosmic microwave background. For 10 points, identify this quantity estimated at 71 kilometers per second per megaparsec, whose reciprocal approximates the age of the universe.

answer: {Hess's} law [prompt on {conservation} of {energy}]

A 2008 paper saw improved accuracy on the Shafizadeh model when this law was applied to Sri Lankan waste disposal in determining biomass yield, and its formulator notably showed that the oxidation of sugars leads to saccharic acids. This law holds because the quantity it concerns equals the sum of internal energy and pressure times volume, two state functions, meaning that quantity is path-independent, and when applied, this law necessitates that reversal of reactions leads to a change in sign. For 10 points, identify this law, which holds that the enthalpy change of a reaction may be calculated from the enthalpies of a series of intermediate reactions.
