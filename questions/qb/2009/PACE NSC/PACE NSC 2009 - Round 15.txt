One idea of this type can be formally stated by commuting time reversal and ensemble average operators on the equation of motion for a single particle. Another statement of this kind is commonly treated by introducing a term proportional to the logarithm of the particle number factorial, which corresponds to distinguishability of mixing particles. In addition to those named for Loschmidt and Gibbs, one of these says that a set cannot be a member of itself. For 10 points, name these statements that lead to scientific contradictions, examples of which include Russell's and the twin one, a consequence of special relativity.

In one variation of this technique, ligands reversibly react with proteins which may be tagged with polyhistidine residues. That is usually followed by CIPP. Another form of it is performed on glass coated with an adsorbent material like silica gel, which can also line the insides of capillary tubes useful in this technique after vaporizing the gas. In addition to the thin layer and capillary gas types, this can be performed through a stationary phase of charged particles in the ion exchange type. For 10 points, identify this technique separating substances based on their chemical properties, such as the pigments of a plant into its constituent colors in the paper type.

Leibniz's law in the context of computer science deals with this concept and Barbra Liskov argues that for mutable objects it reduces to its referential form. Java specifies that it must be reflexive, symmetric, transitive, consistent, and is false when dealing with null objects, but this definition runs into problems when dealing with subtyping. It is denoted in imperative languages with two symbols and declarative with one, before which an exclamation point is placed in Java if this condition does not hold. For 10 points, name this relation that is true between two objects if they are the same.

answer: Henry's law

The concentration-dependent activity coefficient is equal to this law's associated constant divided by pressure, and a high value of that constant has applications for easy air-stripping of chemicals from water. It is equivalent to Raoult's Law for ideal mixtures, but for non-ideals, it works best when dissolved mole fraction approaches zero. This law is useful in explaining noble gas solubility in silicate melts and the Bends experienced by deep-sea divers. For 10 points, name this law, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the pressure of the gas above the liquid.
