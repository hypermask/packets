answer: {S}-Waves [accept secondary {waves}; accept shear {waves}]

These entities cause no volume changes since they have a dilatation of zero, and when they interact with the surface they can give rise to Love waves through their horizontal components. They cannot pass through the Gutenberg discontinuity because their velocities are directly proportional to the rigidity of their medium, preventing travel through liquids. Hence these waves are unable to move to the outer core, creating a shadow zone beyond 104 degrees from their source. Slower and more destructive than their counterparts, for 10 points, identify these seismic waves that move the earth perpendicular to their direction of travel unlike P waves.

answer: The Great Proletarian {Cultural Revolution}

The “Two Whatevers” and “Seek Truth From Facts” were successive slogans summarizing how to proceed from this period, whose early period saw the “January Storm.” Project 571was a failed coup plotted during this period, while a young professor's posting of a dazibao, a “big character poster,” prompted this movement's figurehead to issue “Bombard the Headquarters,” leading to the targeting of the Four Olds and the destructive rampages of the Red Guards.

HtaA and HtaB are proteins implicated in foreign hemin binding in the causative agent of this disease, which releases a toxin that ADP ribosylates a modified histidine residue in EF2, thus inhibiting translation. Bela Schlick developed a test for susceptibility to this disease, while Emil Behring and Emile Roux developed a serum therapy to counteract this disease. Caused by a Corynebacterium, it is most commonly associated with a gray or black coating at the back of the throat which causes difficulty in breathing and swallowing.

answer: {C4} fixation or photosynthesis

In certain organisms, it occurs in the mestome sheath, and it takes place in structures that display Kranz anatomy. PEPC carboxylates a compound derived from pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate, which is shuttled to bundle sheath cells and transformed into either malate or aspartate. This allows for concentration of CO2 to be used by Rubisco. Sometimes named for its two discoverers, M. D. Hatch, and C.R. Slack, for 10 points, identify this process employed by maize and sugar cane plants which spatially separates CO2 and Rubisco unlike CAM.

Celtic myth features a trio of these figures who often took the forms of crows or ravens; they were Macha, Badb, and the Morrigan. One of these carried a temple in one hand; he was the Buddhist god Bishamonten, who was often conflated with the Shinto one of these, Hachiman. The Vedic one killed the stone serpent Vrtra and cracked open the cave of Vala to free the Ushas; that one was also the weather deity who killed Vritra, Indra.

answer: {Black Friday} [accept descriptive answers such as “Fisk and Gould's attempt to corner the gold market” before mentioned]

A key part of this plan hinged on the mistaken insertion of a period into a telegram reading “letter delivered all right.” An attempt to involve Horace Porter in this plan was rebuffed, so this scheme began in earnest with a ten thousand dollar no-interest loan to Daniel Butterfield. An important participant was Abel Corbin, who brought the architects of this scheme into high social circles. George Boutwell finally put a stop to this event. For 10 points, the release of government reserves and the lowering of prices to 133 dollars an ounce put a stop to what day in 1869, on which James Fisk and Jay Gould attempted to corner the gold market?

answer: {surface tension}

The Wilhelmy plate method is a way of monitoring this property over time. The behavior of Bénard cells is associated with a gradient in this property, which leads to transfer of mass across an interface due to a gradient in this, also called the Marangoni effect. Alveoli try to reduce this property along their membrane, and it is the reason dew condenses into droplets rather than remains a puddle. Also responsible for capillary action, for 10 points, identify this property which allows water striders to walk on water because the strength of hydrogen bonds allow for slight depressions at near the interface with air and which is generally reduced by surfactants.

answer: Congress of Berlin

The Cairoli cabinet in Italy came under heavy fire for Italian losses after this event, and offered up foreign minister Luigi Corti as the scapegoat. Lord Salisbury expressed concern in later years that Britain “backed the wrong horse” at this meeting, which allowed France to occupy Tunis and placed Britain in control of Cyprus. Another key participant here was Gyula Andrássy, who negotiated the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary. This meeting also shrunk the generous boundaries of the new Bulgarian state.

Raman spectroscopy of single particles of it reveals a single line at 1575 inverse centimeters, and Atomic Force Microscopy uses the Highly Oriented Pyrolytic form as a calibration tool. Two surfaces of this material were found to show superlubricity in 2004, and unlike diamond, it is an electrical conductor.

answer: {nickel}

This element has a doubly magic 48 isotope, and an aluminum alloy of this metal is heated in the presence of sodium hydroxide to obtain a catalyst that can reduce almost anything with double bonds. This metal is extracted in a process where its ore reacts with carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produces a tetracarbonyl intermediate, called the Mond process. Electrons were fired at a target made of this element in an experiment which confirmed the wave-particle duality, performed by Davisson and Germer. Coming in a Raney variety, for 10 points, identify this element usually found as its namesake metal hydride in electrochemical cells.
