Binding of these to the TIR1 protein causes the degradation of their namesake proteins, which are otherwise bound to ARF proteins. They are pumped out of cells by PIN proteins, and they can activate the pumping of protons into the cytoplasm, which results in a decrease of pH. They are found in higher concentrations in apical buds than lateral buds, thus playing an important role in apical dominance, and common examples of these include indole-3-acetic acid. For 10 points, identify this class of plant hormones which influence phototropism and geotropism.
