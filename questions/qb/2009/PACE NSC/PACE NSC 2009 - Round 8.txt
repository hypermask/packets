answer: {oxbow} lakes [prompt on {meanders} before mentioned]

Like point bars, these structures are formed not by deposition of the suspended load but by secondary flow, since the common belief that the primary, vortex flow forms them conflicts with Bernoulli's principle. The formation of these structures is linked with helicoidal flow in the cross section of an inner bend. These landforms ultimately develop into meander scars upon drying up because they do not receive water from their source river. Called billabongs in Australia, for 10 points identify these structures which form when meanders become so deep that they are bypassed by the original stream, forming curved lakes.
