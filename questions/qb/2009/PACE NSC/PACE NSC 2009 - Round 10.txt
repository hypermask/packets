answer: friction

Pendry described this entity via the van der Waals force between two infinite slabs of dielectric and linked it to quantum shearing in a vacuum. The rolling type of this, which like other types is governed by Amontons' laws, occurs due to deformation of objects, and Coulomb developed a law for its dry kinetic type. According to those laws, this force only depends on the strength of the applied load and is independent of sliding velocity and area of contact. For 10 points, name this force, whose magnitude equals its namesake coefficient times the normal force and which itself resists movement along a surface.
