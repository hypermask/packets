answer: {horse} [accept: {ashva} from an {adhvaryu priest} before “{ashvamedha}”]

The opening line of the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad states that this animal's head is the dawn before going on to compare each of its body parts to something and telling a story about death transforming himself into this animal. Uchaishravas was a flying animal of this kind that emerged from the churning of the milk ocean and was eventually acquired by Indra. The ashvamedha ceremony involved mimicked copulation between this animal and the queen and functioned as a kingship ritual that ended in this animal's sacrifice, a key ceremony in Vedic and Proto-Indo-European religion whose sacrificial victims would be selected for prowess in racing. For ten points, name this animal that says “neigh”.

answer: Word and {Object}

This work presents a method of "eating one's cake and having it" which is illustrated by quotation and concatenation in the section "Definition and the Double Life." It posits the substitutivity of identity in the statement "'Tully was a Roman' is trochaic", leading to a discussion of opacity in a section on the "Vagaries of Reference." This work also features sections on the "Flight from Intension" and "Ontogenesis of Reference", while its first chapter uses the one word sentence "Ouch" to discuss "The Objective Pull; Or, E Pluribus Unum." One of this work's major ideas was expanded in its author's later Ontological Relativity, and is illustrated by the different ways one could translate a native's utterance of the word "gavagai." Putting forth the thesis of indeterminacy of translation, for 10 points, name this 1960 work of Willard Van Orman Quine.

answer: {René Girard}

One of this man's works considers "Proust's Conversion" in the section "Beyond Scandal."  One of this man's works recounts a narrative by Philostratus in which the Ephesians stone a man for being a "plague demon", thus illustrating the power of contagion in polarizing groups; that section, "The Horrible Miracle of Apollonius of Tyana", appears in this man's I See Satan Fall Like Lightning. One of his works considers Peter's denial of Jesus as a skandalon, and discusses the victimage mechanism of archaic religions and the process of hominization in its first section. That work also considers "The Double Semantic Sense of the Word 'Scapegoat'", and he argued that subsequent to conflict arising from a mutual pursuit of objects, violent competition morphs into an antagonism directed against a single person. For 10 points, name this French philosopher of anthropology, who elucidated his theory of mimetic desire in works such as Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World and The Violence and the Sacred.

This man's views were defended by his student Theodore Beza at the Council of Dort, where they were attacked by Jakob Hermann, also called Arminius.

answer: {Humbaba} the Terrible [accept: {Huwawa}]

According to one account of this figure's death, when he begged his killers for his life, one of them replied that to let thus figure live would be as absurd as giving a wig to a captured priest. This figure claimed that he was raised in the mountains by the sun god Utu and did not know his mother or father, while in another account he claims to be the son of a mountain and a cave. This figure had seven auras, which were re-distributed after his death, and he once rejected a bribe of little shoes, big shoes, and the concubine Matur, responding to each offer with one of his seven terrors. An expedition of fifty men without wives or children were sent to fight this figure, and they were aided by the twelve winds of Shamash, the patron god of this figure's killer.

answer: {Deep} Play: Notes on the {Balinese Cockight} [prompt on “{Interpretation} of {Cultures}” until mention]

This work claims that “radical nationalism” leads to Puritanism because elites are afraid of the nation being embarrassed. Early in this text, the author describes being treated as invisible or hearing the ultimate nonword, yes, and then being accepted after running during the breakup of an “superorganism” This text claims that by shouting out “six”, “five”, or “brown”, observers are actually affirming their social ties. The author notes that traveling combatants are presumed to be the most skilled, as otherwise they would not take the effort of traveling. The titular activity, which is a dramatization of status concerns, has such high stakes that to play it seems irrational. For ten points, name this last chapter of The Interpretation of Cultures by Clifford Geertz, which deals with fowl-related gambling on a certain island.

answer: {Epictetus}

This man compared the impressions and opinions of the mind to the rays of light on a dish of water. He distinguished the "protreptic" and "elenctic" modes amongst the three modes of philosophical discussion. He claimed that "Conduct me, Zeus, and thou o Destiny the way that I am bid by you to go" is amongst the maxims one must always keep at hand. He also argued that one must always behave as at a dinner party, and that a father who runs away to weep when his child is ill behaves less naturally than a man who stays by his child's bedside. He used Aristotle's term prohairesis to refer to volition and the capacity for choice and asked "Must I then die lamenting?" to which he responded "I must be put in chains." He claimed "some things are in our control and some are not" at the beginning of one work, compiled by his student Arrian. For 10 points, name this former slave and Stoic, whose sayings were collected in his Enchiridion and Discourses.

answer: {Seth} [accept: {Set}; {Seti}; {Sutekh}; {Setech}]

Archaeologists have discovered a prayer inscription addressed to this god, whose speaker asks this god for the stamina to please his woman all night long, which this god is described as being capable of doing. The hippopotamus is sacred to this god, which led to an unpopular ban on hippo hunting during a foreign dynasty of Asiatic invaders who worshipped this god, the Hyksos. Though he doesn't do so every night, this god occasionally uses a spear to slay Apophis in the underworld. In one story, this red-haired consort of Astarte is tricked into eating semen-laced lettuce by Horus, who avenges a murder committed by this god. For ten points, name this desert-dwelling Egyptian god of chaos, perhaps best known for killing Osiris.
