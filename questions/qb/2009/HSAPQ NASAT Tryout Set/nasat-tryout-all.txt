answer: cosine

This function's Taylor series approximation begins 1 - X2/2! + X4/4! ("One minus X squared over two factorial plus X to the fourth over four factorial"). In Euler's Formula, this function added to i(sin(x)) ("I times the sine of X") is equal to eix ("E to the I X"). This function is also equal to the square root of 1-sin2 (theta) ("One minus sine squared of theta") and approaches zero as theta approaches p/2 ("pi over two"). Name this function equal to a triangle's adjacent side over its hypotenuse.

The Hoffman modulation contrast type of these devices enhances phase gradients. A component named after Nomarski (no-MAR-skee) is used in the differential interference contrast type of these devices. Abbe (AH-BAY) condensers are attached to these devices. Confocal ones remove light that is out of focues. They have objective and ocular pieces. The multiplication of the strengths of two of their pieces gives the total magnification. For 10 points, name these laboratory devices that magnify images of cells and other structures.

In the MIPS ("mips") architecture, many ALU ("A"-"L"-"U") operations, such as add, have this as their opcode. In "one's complement" notation there are two of these. In Unix, slash dev slash null has a counterpart that produces these. In C++ this is equivalent to false. Arrays usually start with this index. In digital circuits, this number corresponds to a low voltage. A common programming error, or exception, is dividing by this number. For 10 points, name this value, which is contrasted with "one" in the binary system used by computers.
