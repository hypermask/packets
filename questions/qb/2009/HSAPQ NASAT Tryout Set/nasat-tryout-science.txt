This statement follows from the fact that the quantity it concerns is a state function, and therefore its value is independent of the system's trajectory. This statement is often framed in terms of the heats of formation of reactants and products. For 10 points, name this statement of thermodynamics that suggests that a reaction's enthalpy change is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes of each step.

answer: {water} [accept {groundwater}; or {underground water}; or {H2O}; or other reasonable equivalents]

This substance is assumed to have vertical equipotential lines in order to simplify solutions to an equation for its movement. That assumption named for Dupoit is invoked along with Darcy's law to explain this substance's movement. Pockets of air are found alongside it in the vadose zone. It is present in any bedrock pore in the phreatic zone. Structures that contain it can emit it spontaneously if its namesake "table" is above ground level. This substance flows freely from artesian wells. For 10 points, name this substance, which is found in porous rock in aquifers.

answer: {neurons}

Early development of some of these cells are guided by netrin (NET-rin) and semaphorin (SEM-uh-FOR-in) proteins. Historically, reticular (RET-ick-YU-lar) theory contrasted with these cells' namesake doctrine. Examples of these cells include pyramidal cells and Purkinje (pur-KIN-jee) cells. The cell body of one of these cells is known as the soma, and a "hillock" in these cells generates an action potential, which is propagated down the axon. For 10 points, name these cells of the nervous system.

answer: graphs

The Havel-Hakimi theorem gives the conditions for a sequence to correspond to one of these. Ramsey's theorem deals with the coloring of complete ones. They can occur in undirected and directed forms, the latter of which gives a direction to one of their components. Hamilton and Euler (OY-ler) name cycles in these; Euler's is used in the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg Problem, which launched the study of them. For 10 points, name these mathematical objects made of vertices and edges.

answer: {erosion}

Some models of this process have a LS factor, and the most common model for it is the revised USLE. This process comes in sheet, rill, and gully forms. It opposes orogeny and loosens the ped structure. The products of this process can undergo deposition. Fluvial, aeolian, and glacial processes cause this process, which can be increased by a lack of vegetation. It is similar to, but not the same as, the related concept of weathering. For 10 points, name this process by which materials such as soil are moved, such as when a stream wears down its banks.

answer: {Ampere's} Law

This law's integral and differential forms can be related by the Kelvin-Stokes Theorem. The original formulation of this law broke the rule that the divergence of a curl must be zero; that flaw was corrected with the addition of a displacement current by James Maxwell. In cases with the requisite symmetry, this law is used in place of the more cumbersome Biot-Savart (BEE-oh suh-VAR) Law. For 10 points, name this law that states that the line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop is proportional to the current passing through it.

answer: two [accept {2}]

This is the number of variables that the Ackermann function takes. Euler's formula states that the number of vertices, minus the number of edges, plus the number of faces of any convex polyhedron is equal to this number. This is the only number for which the reciprocals of its powers sum to the number itself. This is the highest number x at which a to the x plus b to the x can equal c to the x, according to Fermat's Last Theorem. It is the third number in the Fibonacci series. For 10 points, name this number, the only even prime.
