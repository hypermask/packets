answer: {Mantua}

A pagan temple in this city was famously turned into its Romanesque Rotunda di San Lorenzo, built with bricks in the local style and to emulate the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Alberti constructed a church to house a relic of Christ's blood, the Basilica di Sant'Andrea, in this home to Corregio's Metamorphoses series and the Feast of Cupid and Psyche, the latter by a man who also depicted trumpeting angels above as the titular group is crushed by pillars in The Fall of the Giants. That artist, Giulio Romano, was commissioned to construct this city's Palazzo Te, considered the epitome of Mannerist architecture, by its Duke Federico II. Its most famous building, an extension of the Castle of St. George, includes the Room of Archers and a room bounded by the “Meeting” and “Court” scenes most famous for a group of angels and a peacock who pear over the railing from an open section of sky painted to resemble an oculus. It is home to numerous works commissioned for the ruling Gonzaga family including Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi, the bridal chamber of the Ducal Palace. FTP, identify this Italian city in where Gilda is stabbed and “La donna e mobile” is sung in Verdi's Rigoletto, a city located East of Milan in Lombardy.

answer: Charles {Maturin}

This author may have written the lines “Nature – Ethereal essence, fire divine, / Pure origin of all that Earth was fair,” although it is attributed to James Wills, and that poem is called The Universe. In one of his plays, Adelmar rescues the title character from a snowstorm, even though earlier he had witnessed him kill Wallenberg's father and had denied him marriage to his daughter Urilda. In his last novel, Sir Redmond Blaney and Jane are married at the title haunted locale, Leixlip Castle. In addition to The Milesian Chief and The Fatal Revenge, this author is best known for a novel that begins with a character being told to (*) burn a portrait by his uncle. That character eventually falls into the sea after seeing an apparition, where he is told a tale about Immalee by a man whose family was controlled by evil monks. Eventually, in that novel by this author, the daughter of Don Francisco of Aliaga dies when giving birth to the child of the title character, a man who for two centuries tries to collect souls for Satan. For ten points, name this Irish author of Melmoth the Wanderer.

answer: {dispersion}

The effect of high values of this measure in electrified nitrobenzene cells are approximated by Langevin-Born Theory, and it may be alleviated by the Senarmont method.  Cross-sectional areas of three dimensional surfaces across which it occurs may be imaged in convergent beam electron diffraction via higher order Laue zone energy analysis. (*) One governing equation gives the complex electric permittivity of a dielectric as a function of angular momentum and contains the term negative two over pi times the Cauchy principle value. That expression, which implies the existence of its real and imaginary components, is the Kronig-Kramers relation. The Sellmeier Equation determines the strength of its optical form, which may be used to determine optic sign, while its measure in transparent materials is the Abbe Number. FTP, what is this measure of the variation in the refractive indices of a material with wavelength that causes the splitting of white light in a prism?

answer: {Frederick}, Lord {North}, {2nd} Earl of {Guilford}

John Horne Tooke's Fads Addressed to Landholders was a diatribe against this man, and this man was often supported by the Bishop John Butler, who wrote under the pseudonym Vindex. He initiated the downfall of the Duke of Choiseul when he sent ships to protect the Falkland Islands, and after holding his most famous position he propped up the Duke of Portland in a coalition with Charles (*) Fox. His ministry members included Lord George Germain and the Earl of Sandwich, and his passing of a bill allowing Catholics to serve in the military led to the Gordon Riots. For 10 points, identify this British prime minister under whose tenure the American Revolutionary War was fought.

This work posits that a certain group's flight from its own identity embodies its ideology and declares it a “joint stock company,” a section which is expanded in the author's subsequent examination of the bourgeoisie, The Fashion System. It also includes an magazine cover encountered while at a barber's shop used to explain an extensive diagram of the signifier-signified relationship, an image of a saluting black soldier. Milk, rather than water, is declared the true “anti” form of a certain consumable and the “grandiloquence” of a certain activity is used to explain that it is a spectacle rather than a sport, in this work's most famous sections, which examine red wine and professional wrestling as examples of the titular phenomenon “today.” FTP, identify this work examining how the titular beliefs can arise from signs and exist as speech relationships, a collection of essays by Roland Barthes about modern instances of systems whose traditional examples include Norse, Aztec, and Greco-Roman.

answer: "Poem {without} a {Hero}" [{Poema bez geroya}]

This poem's author noted that its method of composition was similar to Peter Viereck's "The Tree Witch" and Robbe-Grillet's Last Year at Marienbad, and the line "I am ready for death", spoken by the cornet before his suicide, appears in the play Gondla and references the murder of that play's author. The third section, "Epilogue", takes place on "the white night of June 24, 1942," and the middle section, "Reverse", contains blank lines that mimic the censored lines of Eugene Onegin and depicts an editor rejecting the first section of the poem. That section, "1913", is the most explicitly allegorical, with the "Demon" representing Alexander Blok and the Milepost, Vladimir Mayakovsky. For ten points, identify this poem often paired with "Requiem" and published after Khrushchev's thaw, the final work of Anna Akhmatova.

answer: {Edman degradation}

One impediment encountered in this procedure can be overcome with the use of compounds such as dansyl chloride, while an earlier technique developed by Max Bergmann overcomes that impediment by benzoylating the sample. D.H. Williams combined this technique with fast atomic bombardment to create the "subtractive" type of it, and G.S. Begg and its namesake used humpback whale myoglobin as a reagent in the first (*) automated method of performing this reaction. The second step of this reaction is performed with anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid as the cleaving agent. Its first step uses a phenylisothiocyanate and it eventually creates a phenylthiohydantoin derivative that can be identified by electrophoresis, though other methods must be used to find disulfide bridges. For 10 points, identify this process where N-terminal amino acids are removed from a peptide chain, a method of protein sequencing named for a Swedish chemist.

Blossius of Cumae supported this kingdom's final pretender, Aristonicus, who was captured by Marcus Perperna. Another ruler of this kingdom had the sobriquet "brother-loving" and helped to defeat Pharnaces I, and in turn received assistance from Rome in defeating Prusias II of Bithynia. The founder of this kingdom, Philetaerus, won his independence after betraying his master at the battle of Corupedium, while this kingdom's greatest ruler was a strategos of the Aetolian League during the first and second (*) Macedonian Wars and had a notable victory over the Galatians. Site of the second largest library in the ancient world, this kingdom was bequeathed to Rome after the death of Attalus III. Its Great Altar is housed in a namesake Berlin museum. For 10 points, name this Hellenistic kingdom in western Anatolia centered on a namesake Greek city.

answer: {Empedocles}

Aristotle attributes the “Zion Dialectic” to this philosopher that theorized mules are infertile because their wombs are attached to their bellies. Another of his scientific theories is that salts are solidified because of the sun. One of this philosopher's works discusses that whatever is lawful extends through the wide-ruling air and boundless light, and a later part of it a father who killed his son with a prayer in preparation for a feast, and equates it with a time where the children kill their parents. This philosopher believed that animals housed sinful souls, and he also believed that there is a correlation between the soft blood of the body and the amount of air breathed in. This philosopher frequently referred to his “two-fold” truths, and he refers to entities that wander near the sea of life, those entities, are detached from the bodies, and are limbs. This man also theorized about the importance of a concept which makes many out of one, Strife. For ten points, name this philosopher who discussed the notion of the four elements before throwing himself into Mt. Etna.

answer: {Whittaker}-{Nyquist}-{Shannon}-{Kotel'nikov} Theorem [accept names in any order]

Functions of the critical value specified by this theorem approximate Bastiaan's dual function, while if rates increase from critical, they are better modeled via Gabor analysis. In practice, this expression may be implemented using a Küpfmüller Integralsinus filter, and part of the purpose for imaging programming involving it is to avoid the formation of moiré patterns, (*) which in cameras is accomplished with a lithium niobate 2-layer. Its logarithmic extension to channel capacity is known as Hartley's Law, and both expressions satisfy the Raabe condition. It may be best demonstrated using a Dirac comb and any simple continuous signal, although Whittaker and Kotel'nikov filters may also be employed to reduce unwanted noise. For 10 points, name this theorem which describes the minimum necessary frequency for analog-to-digital conversions as at least twice the input bandwidth, a sampling theorem named for two information scientists.

This figure is depicted as an old man lying on his side with his hands at the side of his head in the Sala di Opi of the Palazzo Vecchio, while a putto holding a mask and a vase with a face on it appear to the right of this figure, who is cloaked in red, in a painting by François Boucher. He is shown in the bottom left of a work that features a putto sitting on a heavily foreshortened tree stump above him, while a dog sits next to him and below a nude young man reaching up to grab a leaf in his left hand. That painting, a fresco in the Villa Medici which features this figure as an old peasant wearing a yellow shirt and holding a basket in his right hand, depicts his lover wearing a sickle and holding a green dress in the bottom right, while the composition is focused on a large circular window in its center. A portrait with a pear for a nose depicts Rudolph II as this figure and was painted by Giuseppe Arcimboldo.

answer: The {Third Policeman}

The protagonist of this novel engages in a lengthy discussion of Hatchjaw and Bassett's critiques of a work known as Golden Hours, the author of which posits that sleep is actually just a rapid series of fainting fits. The protagonist of this work is inadvertently rescued by a gang of one-legged brigands led by Martin Finnucane, whose antics give the protagonist time to elude a character who believes people are inappropriately exchanging identities with their bicycles. The protagonist is obsessed with the fictional philosopher de Selby, and his life's goal is to codify de Selby's works. The plot of this novel is driven by the protagonist's desire to recover a cash box he'd stolen from Philip Mathers along with John Divney, who'd betrayed him shortly thereafter. That box eventually turns up in the possession of the title character, Fox, who reveals that the box contains an all-powerful substance called “Omnium” and that the narrator is actually dead. For 10 points name this novel by Flann O'Brien.

answer: {Sachs}-{Wolfe} Effect

The Limber approximation is commonly utilized to simplify the power law expression of the principle difference associated with this phenomenon. Second order nonlinear contributions to it have been shown to be equal to those given by the Kaiser-Stebbins effect, and at small angular scales, it may be enhanced or impaired by the Rees-Sciama or (*) kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects. One of its versions concerns the surface of last scattering, while its most commonly used form arises from dark energy models and occurs when certain particles traverse potential wells. Responsible for the ripples detected by the WMAP satellite, for 10 points, name this effect marked by the presence of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation first stated as equal to negative one third the gravitational potential phi times c squared, which is caused by the red shift of photons.

An Imagist adaptation of this event includes the sections GBH and All Day Permanent Red, and was written by Christopher Logue, while the role of “formulas” in the Parry/Lord thesis was centrally developed by analyzing descriptions of it. One work it inspired begins after a frightening snake prompts one figure to submerge, drowning a character whose followers begin a campaign of genocide until they are beaten back by crabs. Two men dress as beggars after a ghost sends them to search for some bones in the so-called “little” version of another account in a group of works inspired by this event. An 1808 drama sees one of its participants get into a fight over a rose field after being jilted by Prothoe; that character's corpse may  subsequently have been the subject of necrophilia during this event, drawing fatal criticism from Thersites. A description of it  led to the conclusion “bonus dormitat,” a complaint about the “nods” of one man's description of this event in the Arse Poetica, and it is the setting of another play about the title figure's mass-murder of a group of sheep. Parodied in The Battle of Frogs and Mice and providing the setting for Kleist's Penthesilea, FTP, identify this ten-year campaign that involved Briseis, Astyanax, Priam, and Achilles, depicted by Homer in The Iliad.

In Japanese myth, these entities were incorporated into the attendants of Koumokuten, while one named Muscalinda protects the Buddha and one named Ulupi mothered Iravat. One of them pimped out his sister to Jaratkaru, producing the rishi Astika, who helped protect them from a fire of buttery doom. One of these individuals poisoned the meal of King Parikshit, earning the enmity of Janamejaya, and fathered Aswasena. A single Kadamba tree grew on the banks of the Yamuna until Krishna's encounter with one of them named Kaliya. Takshaka and the goddess Manasa are venerated by this group, who are linked with the holder of the sky and are led by a figure who bound himself to Mount Mandar and exhaled the Halahala during the churning of the mlik, leading to Shiva's blue throat. Following a wager between Kasyapa's wife Vinata, their half-brother battled a gigantic razor blade-wielding robot, but betrayed this group by allowing Indra to recapture the immortality-granting elixir amrita. Born from Kadru's thousand eggs, they include Shesha and Vasuki and are the sworn enemy of Garuda. FTP, identify these individuals in Hindu myth, often depicted on temples as serpent-human hybrids.

answer: {“Kaddish”}

One character in this work says that God “has a cheap cabin in the country” and “likes lentil soup.” This work quotes the first four lines of “Last night the nightingale woke me” in between one character saying that she played the mandolin and the narrator telling her not to kick her sister, who has an arthritic heart. The second section of this work ends with a letter stating that “the key is in the sunlight at the window”. One section of this work asks “what have I left out . . . what have I forgotten” before saying (*) “farewell / with a long black shoe” and repeating the refrain “with your eyes."  At the opening of this poem, the author  thinks, “Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets & eyes,” and the phrase “Blessed be He!” appears numerous times in the “Hymmnn” which comes between two sections of this poem. This poem's last section alternates between crows shrieking “caw caw caw" and the narrator repeating “Lord Lord Lord.”  For 10 points, name this long poem on the death of Naomi Ginsberg named by her son for the Jewish prayer for the dead.

The contrast between the flute and the D notes being played by the cellos and bass in the 3rd movement of this work creates a dissonance that, much like the 3rd movement of the Pastoral symphony, is often corrected by overzealous conductors. The first movement is unusual in that it shifts tempo to presto in a 6/8 meter, while the fourth movement contains an extremely difficult double fugue section with a violin section written specifically for a string section led by Johann Peter Salomon. The most famous part of this work is an ostinato accompaniment that begins with the bassoons and pizzicato strings and ends with bassoon and flute two octaves apart.

answer: {Meitner}-{Auger Emission} or Effect or {autoionization}

This phenomenon saps the recombination energy of photoluminescence centers in the impurity bands of semiconductors near band gap transitions by inducing phonon cascades, an effect also experienced in light-emitting diodes. Relative intensities it generates may be anomalously high due to associated Coster-Kronig transitions.(*) It has a higher probability of occurrence for light isotopes of heavy elements due to their propensity to undergo electron capture decay. Its quantification is given by 1 minus omega, or the fluorescent yield, which is the probability that an X-ray will be emitted instead of the occurrence of this effect. It produces energies from 280 to 2100 electron volts, small enough that only surface atoms are involved in its namesake spectroscopy. For 10 points, name this effect in which re-absorption of K-shell photons by outer-shell electrons results in the ejection of a secondary electron.
