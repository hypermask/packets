answer: {Guy} of Lusignan [or {Guy} of Jerusalem or {Guy} of Cyprus]

As a youth, this person led a raid that killed Patrick of Salisbury and captured William Marshal, an act that greatly chagrined the ruler with which this figure would later side to defeat and expel Isaac Comnenus, indirectly leading to this ruler's purchase from the Templars of an island that his descendents would rule for three centuries, (*) Cyprus. A more prominent position held by this ruler was obtained through his wife Sibylla in spite of the intrigues of Raymond III of Tripoli. Following a failed attempt to lift a siege of Tiberias, this ruler lost a battle fought near an extinct volcano, the aftermath of which saw the beheading of the captured Knights Templar. For 10 points, name this successor of Baldwin V, a King of Jerusalem who lost at the Battle of Hattin to Saladin, the most prominent member of the House of Lusignan.

answer: {Carthage} [or the {Carthaginian} Empire]

A battle fought at the capital of this former polity resulted in the deaths of both Gordians, ending their rebellion against Maximinus Thrax, and long after the fall of this polity, its capital was razed by forces under Hasan ibn al'Numan, who besieged a force here under John the Patrician and Tiberius Apsimarus. This polity featured a military tribunal known as the One Hundred and Four, and an earlier siege of its capital saw the capture of its citadel, the (*) Byrsa, and a final stand at the temple of Eshmoun. Its forces were defeated at the Battle of Himera by Gelon, and it was victorious at the Battle of The Saw to fight off a revolt under Spendius and Mathos in the Truceless War, also known as the Mercenary War. A kingdom that shared its capital fell after the battles of Ad Decimum and Tricamarum, leading to the deposition of Gelimer the Vandal. Mago and Hanno the Navigator were subjects of, for 10 points, this empire, which had victories at Lake Trasimene and Cannae while fighting the Second Punic War against Rome.

Sylvester's Law of Inertia implies that a bilinear form of this type has unique index and signature. For a topological group, a neighborhood is said to be of this type if it equals its own inverse. For a pair of sets, the difference of this type is equivalent to the logical exclusive or. (*) Cayley's Theorem states that any finite group of order n is isomorphic to some subgroup of the degree-n group of this type. A real matrix is of this type if and only if it is orthogonally equivalent to a real diagonal matrix. The degree-n group of this type contains as a normal subgroup the alternating group of degree n, and consists of permutations on n objects. A binary relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, transitive, and has, for 10 points, what property that also describes a square matrix in which the i,j-th entry equals the j,i-th entry, so that it equals its own transpose?

One confusing aspect of this concept was established in 1892's Hillmon case, which involved Frederick Walters traveling to Wichita. This doctrine was notably refined by Palmer v. Hoffman and by Cardozo's opinion in Shepard v. United States. The Supreme Court established a two-pronged test relevant to this concept in Ohio v. Roberts, though that decision was overturned in the landmark 2004 case Crawford v. Washington. The standard definition of it references "the (*) truth of the matter asserted," and the many exceptions to it include business records, dying declarations, and excited utterances. Covered by Article 8 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, for 10 points, give this legal term for statements made out of court that are generally not admissible in evidence.

answer: {Sir Francis Walsingham}

In one of this man's major endeavors, he employed a man named Antonio Pérez whose correspondence is an important primary source, revealing the identities of such co-workers as Gherard de Malines, John de Cárdenas, and Anthony Standen. This figure's early career saw him fail to negotiate marriage contracts for successive Dukes of Anjou, Henri and François, only to score a major diplomatic coup with the Treaty of Blois as Ambassador to France. This so-called “Moor” succeeded his mentor, Robert (*) Cecil, after the latter appointed him to head an inquest that led to the fall of the Duke of Norfolk. Later, similar work by this councilor led to the expulsion of Bernardino de Mendoza as his networks exposed both the Throckmorton plot and the Babington plot, implication in which led to the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. For 10 points, name this secretary of England's Elizabeth I, whom he also served as spymaster.

answer: {albedo}

In simulations of one version of this value, the Phong-Blinn Model is transformed by its “pumping up,” leading to metallic effects. The Adem Equation gives the net surface longwave radiation as a function of this value, deviation from mean temperature and the probability of entrapment. Another version of it is related by the (*) Heyney-Greenstein phase function to the single free parameter and incident angle. In nuclear physics, it denotes the probability that a neutron will pass a given barrier, and beryllium and lead are noted for their high values of it. A version of Kirchhoff's Law of Radiation defines it as 1 minus the emissivity, though its value is more often given as a ratio of scattered power to total power, and it nears its maximum value for polished silver. For 10 points, name this measure most often used in the calculation of planetary energy budgets defined as the total reflected light over the incident light.

answer: {“Ligeia”}

One scene in this work takes place in a large pentagonal room whose entire southern face is occupied by a window made of an “immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice” which is tinted with a “leaden hue.” The epigraph to this work, which notes that God himself is “but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness,” comes from Joseph Glanvill. This work includes a poem which describes a “gala night / Within the lonesome latter years” in which seraphs “sob at vermin fangs / In human gore imbued.” That poem, which describes a play whose hero is “The (*) Conqueror Worm,” is uttered by the title character just before she dies in a “dim and decaying city by the Rhine.” The narrator of this work marries Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine after the death of his first wife. For 10 points, name this story published in 1838 in which the narrator's dead second wife seems to be transformed into his revived first wife, a work by Edgar Allan Poe.

answer: The {Surrender} of {Breda} [or La {Rendición} de {Breda}; or Las {Lanzas}]

An apparent error in this work's left-center far foreground has the rear of a brown hat visible through the side of a black hat. In the bottom-right corner of this painting, an unfolded blank page shines atop scrub and rocks. This work's background is highly similar to Peter Snayers' earlier depiction of Isabel Clara Eugenia at the same location currently hanging in the same museum as this painting; our view of that background is obscured off-center. Lines including the barrel of a shotgun shouldered by a (*) green-suited man looking directly out from far left and the edge of a blue-and-white checkered flag at right draw us toward the central figure, Ambrosio Spínola, who holds the lacquered wooden ovular tube and white-feathered black hat familiar from the artist's other portraits of nobles as he stands before a line of lancers receiving a large key. For 10 points, name this Prado-housed painting depicting the capitulation of a Dutch town, a 1635 work by Diego Velázquez.

One obscure pathway that results in the reagents used to form this class of chemicals opens with a Pinacol rearrangement of deoxyxyluose; a better-understood pathway that results in an unequal yield of those reagents is the mevalonate pathway. These chemicals form when protic attack resulting from abstraction of OPP groups yields DMAPP radicals, which then combine with one another and with (*) isopentyl diphosphate and undergo stereospecific deprotination, thus forming open-chain varieties of these polymers. Pyrolysis of these compounds led Otto Wallach to posit a rule regarding their structure that is sometimes called the C5 rule but more often named for their monomer. For 10 points, name this family of polymers characterized as built from 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, a unit of five carbons and eight hydrogens also known as isoprene.

The respective applicability of sets of two and four of these equations is a fundamental difference between the anomalous and regular Zeeman effects. A relation that is in some sense a generalization of these entities gives the probability rate as two pi over Dirac's constant times the state density times the square modulus of a perturbation matrix element. (*) The aforementioned Fermi Golden Rule gives quantitative information about the processes about which these laws give qualitative information because these relations are derived in general by considering the inner products of wave functions for different quantum numbers such that transitions between states with those numbers follow one of these when that inner product is non-zero. For 10 points, name these strictures from quantum perturbation theory that often correspond to conservation of quantities like angular momentum and that dictate which quantum transitions are allowed.
