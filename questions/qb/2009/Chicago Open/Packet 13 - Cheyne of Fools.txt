answer: Giorgio de {Chirico}

Leonce Rosenberg built the “Room of the Gladiators” in his home specifically to house works he commissioned this man to create. Six orange and white flags appear behind the half-naked title figures of one of this man's paintings, while another features a display case housing five crackers on a blue background. A notable portrait by this man, who signed his later works “Pictor Optimus,” features a bust of its subject wearing frameless sunglasses, and another of this man's works inspired a poem by Silvia Plath that asks about ladies “with heads like darning-eggs.” Marble sculptures of women lying on stone blocks appear in his Ariadne and Soothsayer's Recompense, while a large marble head appears with a glove and a green ball in his Love Song . Better-known works include The Disquieting Muse and Enigma of an Autumn Afternoon, but he is most famous for a work depicting a lone girl pushing a hoop down an alley. For ten points name this surrealist painter of Mystery and Melancholy of a Street.

answer: {Afonso} I of Portugal [or {Afonso Henriques}; accept {Alfonso/Alonzo}, {Enriquez}, etc.]

This man tried to set up an attack on a port city with the fleet of William and Ralph Viel, but nothing came of their plans. This man's leg was broken during one retreat, leading to his capture after he had broken the Treaty of Sahagun. That breach of treaty came in part due to the actions of Giraldo Sempavor, known as the Fearless, who fought for this man. For four ounces of gold a year, this man received protection from Lucius II. This man was saved by Fernando II from a siege led by Abu Yaqub Yusuf in Santarém, and he signed the Treaty of Zamora with Alfonso VII to recognize gains he made in the Battle of Ourique. Earlier, this man fought against Ferdinand Peres and his own (*) mother, Teresa, leading to victory at the Battle of São Mamede. This member of the House of Burgundy successfully ended vassalage to the Kingdom of Leon. For 10 points, name this man who became the first king of Portugal.

answer: {Jonah} [accept {Yonah} or {Yunus}]

Some scholars have argued that most of this man's book was written by a different source from his prayer in chapter 2, and one of the ironies of this character is that, while he is deceitful, his father's name means “truth." This man makes a cameo eight books before his own and is told to anoint Jehu as rightful king. The Yalkut Shimoni asserts that after this man performed his commanded task, the King of the city to which he had traveled tore down his palace and ordered that both the people and beasts wear sackcloth and ashes in repentance, though this man was disappointed that they were shown mercy at all. A recurring theme at the beginning of the story is this man's “going down,” first to Joppa and then into his napping spot, the hold of a ship. This son of Amittai's book falls between those of Obadiah and Micah and is read every year on Yom Kippur. For ten points name this reluctant prophet of the Hebrew Bible who eventually prophesies the destruction of Nineveh after failing to run away.

answer: Miguel de {Unamuno}

In one of this man's short stories, a racy storyteller befriends a man he calls “the Intruder” before dying at a banquet in the Union Coffeehouse, while in another, the protagonist becomes wary of progress after entering an unpopulated machine-run city. In addition to “Mechanopolis,” this man wrote about a physician who compiles the work All or Nothing while under the care of Dr. Atienza in “The Madness of Doctor Montarco.” In another work by this man, Eugenia runs off with Mauricio the day before she is to marry Augusto, and he wrote a short novel about the town Valverde de Lucerna and its secretly atheist priest. He expressed his cynicism in The Tragic Sense of Life, while a better-known novel centers on a man who writes his Confession and feels a strong relation to the biblical Cain. For 10 points, name this author of Niebla and Abel Sanchez, the founder of Spain's Generacion del 98.

answer: {Noether's} Symmetry Theorem [or {Noether's} First Theorem before “{Symmetry}”]

This lemma is satisfied for nonsmooth extremals if they satisfy the DuBois-Reymond condition. Michael Peskin and Daniel Schroeder wrote of the generalized way that this theorem's quantum analogue can lead to an equation of motion for correlation functions.  That quantum analogue is known as the Ward-Takahashi identity. (*) One of its transformations involving charge and electric current density was first noted by Herman Weyl and is one of the fundamental gauge symmetries in physics. This theorem states that applying a Poisson Bracket to the Hamiltonian and a constant of the motion is zero. For 10 points, identify this theorem, which can be used to derive the conservation of the center of momentum, and states that each symmetry of a system leads to a quantity which is conserved.

answer: {Mountain Meadows} massacre

One person involved in this event was later implicated by a man he called “Dirty Fingered Jake,” and Will Bagley argues that a letter saying a group will “do as they please” was meant to authorize this event.  This event was partly instigated by an approaching army under Stewart Van Vliet, and its aftermath was described by James Henry Carleton.  Philip Klingensmith testified about this event, some participants of which were recruited by being told they had to bury the victims of an Indian attack.  Eighteen children were integrated into local families after surviving this event, which was organized by (*) John D. Lee and Isaac Haight and which was carried out with the help of Paiute Indians.  The Fancher-Baker party, a group of Arkansas emigrants, were the victims of this event, which preceded the breakout of the Utah War.  For 10 points, name this massacre perpetrated by a Mormon militia.

answer: {Talos} [prompt on {Brendan Byrne 1.0}]

One man with this name was a soldier under Turnus who was killed along with Cethegus and Tanais in an attack by Aeneas. The murder of another man by this name is the prelude to the plot of Sophocles's lost play The Camicians, while another killed a group of Sardinians while their mouths were hanging open, resulting in the expression “sardonic laughter.” This is also the name given by Apollodorus to the inventor of the saw and the potter's wheel who was transformed into a partridge after being thrown off a cliff. That character was the nephew of Daedalus, who was banished for trying to kill him. Another figure with this name was a gift given by Zeus to Europa and is said to have died in various ways, including being killed by an arrow shot by the argonaut Poeas and being injured in the shoulder by Medea, after which his ichor flowed out "like molten lead." For 10 points, give this mythological name most famously held by a giant bronze automaton.

answer: {Petals} of {Blood}

At one point in this work, a church leader named Jerrod Brown refuses to give help to a group of travelers aside from giving them “spiritual” assistance, while a lawyer in this work gets elected to parliament before being assassinated. An old woman in this work greets a new arrival to the main city by leaving “a mountain of shit” near that man's place of employment. That man and one of his colleagues had both been thrown out of a school in Siriana years before the events of this novel occurred. One character's grandmother perfects the Theng'eta drink, while another character builds the Sunshine Lodge, which becomes the location of the deaths of Hawkins Kimeria, Mzigo, and Chui. Set in the town of Ilmorog, this is, for 10 points, what work in which Inspector Godfrey interrogates Abdulla and Karega after Wanja's brothel is burned down by Munira, a work by Ngugi wa Thiong'o?

answer: {spermatogenesis} [do not accept: {spermiogenesis}]

The products of the initial stages of this process are connected by cytoplasmic bridges, and excess cytoplasmic material is discarded as "residual bodies" in this process. One part of this process sees the reorganization of the Golgi bodies into a structure which contains lysosomal proteins such as hyaluronidase. This process only commences with the formation of a barrier between the adluminal space and basal compartment of certain (*) tubules, and that barrier is formed by the tight junctions of certain cells which secrete inhibin. This process sees the secretion of androgen binding proteins by Sertoli cells, and most of it takes place in organs which can be elevated or lowered by the cremaster muscle. For 10 points, identify this process which occurs in the temperature-controlled environment of the scrotum, and produces gametes in males.

answer: Muzafer {Sherif}

This psychologist developed the Own Categories Technique, which he wrote about in a paper which discussed its use in Reference Scale and Placement of Items. He also published The Psychology of Ego- involvements and edited the publication Social Psychology at the Crossroads. The lack of a frame of reference produces the effect that this man studied in his dissertation, in which a dot of light appears to move although it does not in reality; that effect is the autokinetic effect. One theory associated with this man emphasized  the role of superordinate goals in the process of conflict reduction. That theory arose from an experiment that this man ran in conjunction with his wife that took two groups of young children and divided them into separate camps at the namesake state park. For ten points, identify this social psychologist most notable for his Realistic Conflict Theory and the Robber's Cave Experiment, a Turkish-American man who wrote Groups in Harmony and Tension.

answer: {Operations} of {Otto Skorzeny} [accept obvious equivalents, prompt on {Nazi Commando Missions} or other equivalents]

One of these actions was foiled by Gevork Vartanian, while another unsuccessfully attempted to foment rebellion among disgruntled Iranian mountain tribes. Another of these actions violated the Hague Convention regarding improper use of uniforms, prompting a later trial. One of these actions was partially inspired by an incident in Caesar and Cleopatra featuring a rolled-up carpet and was code-named “Mickey Mouse.” While a failed one saw an attempted capture of Marshal Tito, more successful ones included a disinformation scheme during the Battle of the Bulge, and an operation that saw the kidnapping of the son of (*) Miklos Horthy. The most notable one is known as the Gran Sasso raid and allowed its target to create the Italian Social Republic. For 10 points, name these actions that include the mission to free the imprisoned Benito Mussolini, which were all carried out by a certain scar-faced Nazi commando.

answer: A {Love Supreme}

The third section of this work includes a notably esclating piano solo which inverts the first and third chords. McCoy Tyner recorded the piano for this work, with Elvin Jones on drums, including the drum roll that begins the third movement.  Jimmy Garrison played the bass on this recording, including a four note motif that binds the first movement, and this recording begins with a loud banging gong, followed by several cymbal rolls in a wash effect. The last part of this recording is a saxophone solo intended to represent the words "Elation. Elegance. Exaltation. All from God. Thank you God. Amen." Divided into four sections including Acknowledgement, Resolution, Persuance, and Psalm, for ten points, identify this hard bop album whose first section includes the mantra that gives it its name, a spiritual recording by John Coltrane.

answer: {Manciple's Tale} [accept anything that {indicates} the {manciple} is {narrating}; prompt on {Canterbury Tales}]

This work concludes with an exhortation to read the “wise and honourable” Solomon and repeats Seneca's advice to examine David's Psalms. At one point, the narrator concludes that there is no difference between an “outlawed man or errant thief,” before concluding that since he is not a man of texts, he should continue with his story. The prologue to this work references a little town named Bob-up-and-down and features the narrator being warned not to openly chide another character for drunkenness. During the climax to this work, the protagonist breaks his harp, lute, arrows, and bow before angrily calling another character a “false thief” and unleashing a curse that turns this character black. Concluding with a moral that says “guard well your tongue, and think upon the crow,” for 10 points, identify this story of Phoebus, who kills his unfaithful wife after receiving information from his white crow, one of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales narrated by a shrewd purchasing agent.

answer: {Seven Bridges} of {Konigsberg} Problem [accept clear knowledge equivalents]

The Ehler Correspondences reveal this conundrum as central to the new science calculi situs proposed as a solution to the limitations of algebraic magnitudes by Leibniz, though the first to attempt a solution trivialized its importance after announcing its resolution in the Marinoni Letter. Its earliest solution implies an early version of the Handshaking Lemma of double counting, (*) and Fleury's Algorithm and the Hierholzer Algorithm are based upon principles introduced by this problem. W.W. Rouse Ball first extended its premise to diagram-tracing puzzles. Variations of this problem attempt to add further arcs to identified nodes marked by the Blue Prince, the Red Prince, the Gasthaus, and the Kirche, though uneven degrees of the original nodes prevent its positive solution. For 10 points each, name this problem, a forerunner of graph theory involving a walking tour of a city on the Pregel River, which was proven impossible by Leonhard Euler.

answer: {Siegfried Kracauer}

This man claimed that the detective novel “transforms an ungraspable life into a translatable analogue of actual reality” in an essay entitled “The Hotel Lobby.” In another of his essays, he claimed that the biography is the only seemingly necessary prose form of the established bourgeoisie. This man divided his home country's cinematic history into four periods in a 1947 work entitled From Caligari to Hitler: A Psychological History of the German Film, while another work saw him specifically exclude color films and cartoons from his analysis. Besides Theory of Film, which saw him conclude that film was meant to record physical reality, he may best known for an essay that which saw him describe “sexless bodies in bathing suits,” who served as products of “American distraction factories.” For 10 points, identify this German thinker who influenced the Frankfurt School with his analysis of the “Tiller Girls,” which he linked to standardized mass culture in the essay “The Mass Ornament.”
