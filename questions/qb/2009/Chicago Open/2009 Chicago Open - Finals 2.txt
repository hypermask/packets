answer: {Bolzano}-{Weierstrass Theorem}[{accept}: Heine-Borel Theorem until it is mentioned]

Mandelkern shows that this theorem is nonconstructive due to its equivalence to the Limited Principle of Omniscience, which is duplicated by its Brouwerian counterexamples. Its namesake property for ideals is equivalent to a P-point of the Cech-Stone compactification beta-omega, but it fails for ideals when their quotient Boolean algebra has a countably splitting family. Its extension to transfinite step sequences with ordinal indices leads to a proof for the Erdos-Rado theorem. (*) One of its common proofs generates a series of nested intervals, each of which contains the leftmost subinterval of the last, and demonstrates that their left end points are a Cauchy sequence with a limit about which the subinterval contains infinitely many points of an infinite set. It follows from subsequences of real numbers via the Monotone convergence axiom, and may be derived from Cantor's intersection theorem and the Heine-Borel theorem, to which it is equivalent. FTP, name this algebraic theorem stating every bounded infinite sequence contains a convergent subsequence, named for a Czech and a German mathematician.

answer: {Ferdydurke}

One character in this work attempts to woo the object of his affection by dancing in her bathroom and hiring a bum to stand outside her window with a green twig in his mouth. This work is interrupted by a fable in which the professors Philifor and Anti-Philifor shoot the limbs off each other's lovers. After his companion rapes the Youthfuls' maid the protagonist flees with him only to be set upon by villagers turned into dogs, and he later absconds with his cousin Isabel after his uncle nearly beats the stable boy Bert to death. An important incident in this novel sees the schoolboy Siphon subjected to"violation by the ear" after a battle of grimaces with Mientus over the other boys' innocence.  After waking up from a nightmare at the novel's beginning the protagonist is visited by Professor Pimko, who quizzes him on Latin grammar until he regresses to adolescence and enters the plot of his own novel. For ten points name this novel about Johnnie Kowalski, the masterpiece of Witold Gombrowicz.

answer: {turbulence} or {turbulent} flow

The first evidence of this phenomenon is preserved by space-inflation induced stretching of Batchelor-Obukhov-Corrsin temperature spectra, and it first appeared at least ten to the minus 33 seconds following the Big Bang. A Hopfinger Cell is a useful tool in studying it, and laboratory simulations often employ the Smagorinsky Model to determine its local-scale kinematics. Its onset occurs during (*) Taylor-Green conditions in LES simulations, which may be experimentally modeled in the Boussinesq approximation. For small increments the occurrence of molecular diffusion it causes varies as the cube of the viscosity and the inverse of the energy dissipation rate to the one-fourth. That relation is the Kolmogorov length scale, which assumes isotropic flow in small scales, though for larger scales entropy across total vorticity increases. For 10 points, name this characterization of fluids with high Froude and Reynold's numbers typified by chaotic eddy-current shedding, the opposite of laminar flow.

answer: {Dasara} [or {Dusshera}; or {Vijaya Dashami}; prompt on “{Navaratri}” until mentioned]

In some regions, this festival is associated with the worship of a shami tree, and historically that ritual was frequently accompanied by a mock battle where a king's army drove away foreigners from the East. A notable parade which celebrates this event ends at Banni Mantapa after beginning at the Chamundi temple near the Mysore palace in Karnataka. It is celebrated on the 10th day of the waxing moon of the month of Ashwin, and it occurs exactly 18 days before (*) Diwali. In some communities, it is accompanied by a Rama Leela, after which statues of Ravana are burned, while others celebrate this festival in honor of the victory of Durga over the demon Mahishasura. It gets its name from the fact that it celebrated after the nine day period called “navaratri.” For 10 points, identify this prominent festival of India.

answer: {Langmuir} Waves

Malaspina and Ergun offer an interpretation of examples of these entities which possess transverse electric fields as eigenmodes of solar wind density cavities. The kinetic equation that describes them may be derived by applying the Wigner-Moyal transform to their respective field relations. Their conversion to electromagnetic radiation is a key mechanism of Type-III Solar Bursts. Their propagation is governed by the (*) Bohm-Gross relation, and the Zakharov equations describe their interaction with the oscillatory modes with which they are always associated, which leads to a deceleration known as Landau Damping. Resulting from density enhancements which violate local charge neutrality, they may generate voltages higher than 100 giga-electron volts per meter. FTP, name these rapid fluctuations in electron density in a plasma, the fastest known matter waves.

Miss Cheeseman appoints the protagonist to ghost write her autobiography, and the protagonist first works under Mr Durce at Meadows, Meade & Grindley. The protagonist of this work encourages typewriters working under Mrs. Coverdale to take Mondays off, repeatedly points out the horn-like bumps on his head, and considers his fear of illnesses to be his "fatal flaw." The protagonist's antics drive a wedge in the relationship between Dixie Morse and her fiance Humprey Place, who finally get married as the Scotch protagonist leaves the titular town. For 10 points, identify this novel in which the devilish Dougal Douglas disrupts the quiet life of the title town, a work by Muriel Spark.

Kapessi Kafundanga was a leader of this organization, as was the awesomely named Abel Chivukuvuku.  Several leaders of this organization were killed in the Halloween Massacre, including Jeremias Chitunda.  Efforts to stop the activity of this group were led by UNAVEM, and this group protested elections soon after accepting the Protocol of Estoril and signing the Bicesse Accords.  A split in this organization led to the creation of the offshoot Renewal faction, and it is now led by (*) Isaias Samakuva.  Largely composed of members of the Chokwe and Ovimbundu ethnic groups, this organization allied with one led by Holden Roberto.  This group was opposed by Cuban troops, while it was itself supported by South Africa in a Cold War proxy war.  It allied itself with the FNLA in a 1975-2002 civil war, in which this group fought against Agostinho Neto and the MPLA, now led by José Eduardo dos Santos.  For 10 points, name this anti-Communist rebel group that went mainstream soon after the 2002 assassination of its leader, Jonas Savimbi, and which was active in Angola.

answer: {acentric factor}

The Korsten method sometimes replaces the Edmeister method for calculating this quantity, as the latter deviates significantly for heavier hydrocarbons in petroleum fractions. A more accurate method gives this quantity as a second order function of the Watson characterization number, and in a more often used formulation of that method, this quantity is multiplied by the first order term to give vapor (*) pressure. In addition to being used in the Lee-Kesler method, it is related to the negative logarithm of the reduced saturation pressure at a reduced temperature of 0.7. All fluids which have similar values for this quantity, reduced pressure, and reduced temperature have similar compressibility factors and display similar deviation from ideal behavior. Noble gases are defined to have a value of zero for this quantity, which was introduced by K. S. Pitzer. For 10 points, identify this quantity which describes the degree to which fluid molecules deviate from being spherically symmetric.

answer: "The {Laugh} of the {Medusa}" (or "La {Rire} de la {Meduse}")

Kleist is held up in this work as a poet "who would go to any lengths to slip something by at odds with tradition". Members of the group examined in this work are labelled "precocious" and "have their mouths gagged with pollen" since the prevailing view about them is that "dark is dangerous". This work states that that group's "new history is coming" and will destroy the status quo's "conceptual orthopedics." It claims that classical bisexuality has been "squashed under the emblem of castration fear" and should be rejected in favor of "other bisexuality" that is free of the "false theater of phallocentric representationalism" that characterizes the central activity. This work insists that a woman without a body is a "servant of the militant male" and must overcome that by becoming a "springboard for subversive action" and "seizing the occasion to speak" and "write for herself". For 10 points identify this essay that claims that the "woman who writes cuts herself out a paper penis" by Helene Cixous that advocates for the establishment of a female written counterposition to the "universal male".

This protein phosphorylates GCN2, which itself phosphorylates eIF2 alpha to inhibit translation of mRNA, and it also regulates translation initiation through the downstream activation of S6 Kinase and 4E-BP.  The TSC1, TSC2, and Rheb proteins mediate crosstalk between this protein and PI-3 Kinase pathways. This protein is inactive in nutrient deficient environments, and in Saccharomyces, inactivation of this protein results in cell-cycle arrest at the G1 stage. The (*) mammalian form of this protein forms a complex with the Rictor protein, which decreases its kinase activity, and also with the Raptor protein. This family of proteins gets its name from the fact that they are inhibited by a namesake compound first isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and that compound is alternatively called sirolimus. For 10 points, identify this pathway which is abbreviated as TOR.
