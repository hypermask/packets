answer: {niacin} [or {nicotinic} acid; accept {b3} until "{third B vitamin}"]

A green reaction for the industrial synthesis of this compound was developed by Robert Raja and uses 3-picoline as the starting material, and that reaction eliminates the nitrous oxide product usually obtained in conventional synthesis. This compound treats a condition characterized by ataxia and aminoacidurea called Hartnup disease. The biosynthesis of this compound begins with the conversion of an amino acid into kynurenine, which is then converted into (*) quinolinate. High doses of this compound can lead to a form of macular thickening, while its deficiency leads to a syndrome called Casal collar, where a erythematous rash is localized to dermatomes C3 and C4. Consisting of a pyridine ring 3-substituted with a carboxyl group, it is readily converted to its corresponding amide which acts as a coenzyme in pathways such as glycolysis. For 10 points, identify this compound whose deficiency is called pellagra, the third B vitamin.

answer: {Symbionese Liberation Army} [or {SLA}]

Les Payne discussed this organization's inspiration from Regis Dubray's philosophy in the book “The Life and Death of” this organization. A cofounder of this group named Robyn Sue Steiner fled to England after a death threat from a member, and later that year their new leadership claimed responsibility for mistakenly thinking the school superintendant they killed, Marcus Foster, required student IDs. Kathleen Soliah was a member of this group who was arrested in 2001 for trying to bomb police cars, and her brother was given immunity when testifying in the murder case of Myrna Lee Opsahl, who was killed in a Carmichael (*) bank heist by members of this group. Four members, including group leader Donald DeFreeze, were killed in a house where tear gas caught on fire in South Central Los Angeles after the most bullet intensive shootout in American history, and the most famous member of this group was both put on a poster with a 7 headed cobra and took the name Tania, and was later pardoned by Bill Clinton for her role in a bank robbery. For 10 points, name this 1970s organization that kidnapped Patty Hearst.

One of this author's characters is the namesake of a John Barth character who suffers from a disease called cosmopsis, the protagonist of The End of the Road. This author's first play opens in the "gripe's house, in the evening" with Lady Flippant bitching about her good-for-nothing husband to Mrs. Joyner, and a better-known work by this author contains the common women Mrs. Flirt and Mrs. Flounce and centers on Mr. (*) Gerard's sexual liberation of a cloistered-off 14 year old girl. In addition to writing Love in a Wood and the aforementioned play based on a Calderon work in which Hippolyta and her fiancee escape to France, The Gentleman Dancing Master, this author wrote a play in which a page sent by one character turns out to be a woman, causing the protagonist to forget Vernish and Olivia, and a play "cleaned up" by David Garrick in which Harcourt and Alithea end up together while Margery is seduced by a man pretending to be a eunuch, Harry Horner.

One of this man's enemies was deposed by the Synod of Tyre after refusing to reconcile this man with the church as ordered by the Emperor. Jehovah's Witnesses view him as a forerunner to Charles Russell. Dying before he could receive his mandated communion from Alexander of Constantine, this man defended himself in a series of popular songs known as his Thalia. His writings were burned when he was banished to Illyricum, and most of his ideas are in concert with his ally Meletius. Integrating Neo-Platonism with a literal reading of the New Testament, his ideas were rejected and replaced with a creed associated with Athanasius. For 10 points, name this man who believed that Christ was only a creation of God and not truly divine and whose heresy was discussed at Nicaea.

answer: {gelifluction} [or {solifluction}; prompt on “{frost creep}” or similar until "{plastic deformation}"]

A similarity law for this process was one result of the Higashi and Corte experiment. The velocity profile of a deposit of this type is given by the product of the constant gamma, acceleration due to gravity, the sine of the slope angle, vertical distance and the exponential of negative k times vertical distance, all divided by apparent viscosity. Jeffery's Theory describes the motion of particles during this process. (*) Nearly vertical particle cohesion consolidation may induce one of its retrograde versions. Its most common form is a plastic deformation process constrained by segregation layers involving pore-pressure induced shearing. In aerial view, evidence of it includes ploughing erratics or a series of interconnected turf-banked lobes or terraces commonly forming a half-crown structure around hillocks or drumlins. For 10 points, name this type of mass wasting, in which concentration of water in the surface areas of periglacial environments leads to downslope flow in permafrost.

In one section of this poem, its speaker addresses the title subject as a "messenger of sympathies" and a "wax and wane in lovers' eyes." The names of "Demon, Ghost, and Heaven" remain from a "vain endeavor" in this poem, in which the speaker later recalls "[calling] on poisonous names with which our youth is fed." The speaker urges the title entity to stay "lest the grave should be/like life and fear, a dark reality" in a section urging it to "depart not," and earlier it is suggested that that departure brought "this dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate." One stanza of this poem is focused on the speaker's (*) boyhood pursuit of ghosts and in its end "the day becomes more solemn and serene."

A domain present in these proteins and primases has a structure similar to a Rossman fold. Anti-cancer drugs such as anthracyclines and acridines are thought to stabilize the complex formed by this protein and its substrate, while a more popular inhibitor of these enzymes is the alkaloid camptothecin. One type of these, which exhibits ATPase activity, initially binds to the Gate segment, after which the T segment (*) moves through the central cavity while the substrate is rigidly held, while type I of these enzymes allow for rotation and re-ligation after proceeding through a phospho-tyrosine intermediate. The first example of it was discovered in E. Coli and was called gyrase. For 10 points, identify these enzymes which change their substrate's linking number, one of which relieves positive and negative supercoiling by cutting and reconnecting DNA.

answer: {How} to {Make Our Ideas Clear}

This work's fourth section cites Scotus Erigena as having misattributed Socrates's death as having come from a lost debate with Helleborus and notes that successively refined determinations of the speed of light ought to converge. This work's third section in turn considers the denotations of "weight," "force," and "path," leading to an explanation of a method for considering acceleration through vector addition the author calls the "parallelogram of forces," which is followed by a comparison of a French phrase and its English equivalent. By considering a tune that consists of a series of notes, only one of which may be perceived at once, this essay distinguishes between what we are immediately and mediately conscious of. The author claims that an old twofold doctrine, which he calls an "ornament of logic," ought to be relegated to a "cabinet of curiosities," and, using the example of communion wine, proposes that the conception of an object's practical effects being the whole conception of the object constitutes the rule for conveying the "third grade of clearness of apprehension." For 10 points, identify this essay by the author of "The Fixation of Belief," Charles Sanders Pierce.

answer: {Pockels} effect

Two bulk mechanisms for the quantum-confined version of this effect complement an interface-based mechanism as the value of the envelope function changes, thereby changing the value of the overlap integral. Zinc oxide wurtzite-like crystalline films demonstrate a "giant" form of this effect, (*) which has been observed in water at the EDL, or electric double layer, on the interface between the water and an electrode. This effect is used in materials like potassium titanyl phosphate to make namesake modulators found in Q-switching lasers, since they serve as voltage-controlled wave plates; those cells require a smaller voltage than analogous constructs using nitrotoluene. This effect may only occur in crystals that lack an inversion center, unlike the closely analogous Kerr effect. For 10 points, name this phenomenon, which occurs when an electric field induces a linear, not quadratic, birefringence.
