answer: {“Peaches”}

One online essay interprets this song to be about a forthcoming communist revolution, with the slower first section being a warning and the upbeat second section showing the revolution itself as represented by the sounds of the “guibass” and “bassitar”.  This song's music video featured its band performing on a lawn before being stalked and attacked by ninjas.  Originally appearing after “Boll Weevil” and before “Dune Buggy”, the title (*) objects are compared to “sun-soaking bulges in the shade” before the singer describes “taking little naps where the roots all twist”.  The singer “poke[s his] finger down inside / make a little room for it to hide” in one of the title objects, a “rotten” one of which the singer squishes in his fist.  For 10 points, name this Presidents of the United States of America song in which the singer expresses a desire to move into the country and eat a lot of the titular fruit.

One prominent figure of this conflict raided the lands around Ely from a base at Ramsey Abbey during it, and it featured Ranulf de Gernon in addition to the aforementioned Geoffrey de Mandeville. One important ecclesiastic in this conflict was Thurstan, Archbishop of York, who, with negotiations at Roxburgh and the organization of the force that won the (*) Battle of the Standard, staved off the invasion of David I, while another, Henry of Winchester, secured papal support for his brother in this conflict. One figure in this conflict was exchanged for Robert of Gloucester after the former had been captured at the Battle of Lincoln. It was ended by the Treaty of Wallingford, which established the succession in favor of Henry Curtmantle, and it began after the death of William Adelin in the wreck of the White Ship. For 10 points, name this English civil war that resulted in the creation of the House of Plantagenet, fought between Empress Matilda and Stephen of Blois.

answer: {"Thyrsis"}

The speaker of this poem asks, "Where are the mowers who…stood with suspended scythe" after finding a boat near the "Wytham flats," and he recalls traveling the track by Childsworth Farm. He talks of "Young Daphnis, with his silver voice" singing in "the hot cornfield of the Phrygian King," and he describes a "sweet city with her dreaming spires" as viewed from Boars Hill. The speaker describes the dissipation of fog as Eve lifting her veil, and his lengthy description of the passing of spring into summer culminates with the line, "The (*) bloom is gone, and with the bloom go I." He laments that "time, not Corydon, hath conquer'd" this poem's title character, whom he associates with the "signal-elm that looks on Ilsley Downs. The area surrounding Oxford provides this poem's setting, and the poet laments that the place he and Arthur Hugh Clough once often roamed is now only frequented by another of this poet's characters, the Scholar-Gypsy. For ten points name this elegy by Matthew Arnold.

answer: {carbocation} [accept {carbonium ion} ]

The first one of these to be directly observed was obtained by the solution of TBF in an antimony-based superacid. That experiment was performed by the man who developed NMR solvents such as “magic acid” and sulfur dioxide for studying these compounds, George Olah. Reactions wherein these intermediates are formed can see the shift of the functional group at the beta position, which is named for (*) Wagner and Meerwein. “Bridged” versions of these contain hydride or alkyl groups which exhibit partial bonding with two other carbon atoms. They can be obtained by the decomposition of diazonium salts, or by the solvolysis of alkyl halides, and since they have a planar geometry, their occurrence at bridgehead positions is controversial. For 10 points, identify this type of compounds wherein a carbon atom has a positive charge, whose tertiary ones are usually the most stable.

Herbert Stein-Schneider has argued that this series is based on descriptions in Hendrick Niclaes's Terra Pacis, and is thus representative of a neo-Catharist worldview. This series was originally housed in the suburban villa of Niclaes Jonghelink, who was a major patron of this series' creator. One member of this series features a yawning cavern across a river from the main action, while a storm appears to be driving that main action. Another member of this series sees a man trimming a barren tree during the titular time period. In addition to The Return of the Herd and The Gloomy Day, this series is also includes two more cheerful events, Haymaking and The Corn Harvest, though it is more famous for a work which features a fire that the titular group passes, as they progress towards a town filled with (*) ice-skaters.

answer: "{Sunday Morning}"

The third stanza of this poem notes that "no mother suckled Jove" and asks if our blood, "comingling and virginal with heaven" will "fail, or shall it come to be the blood of paradise?"  A figure in this poem notes that she is content when birds "test the misty reality of fields before they fly".  This poem ends when pigeons sink "downward to darkness, (*) on extended wings," and it notes that "The tomb in Palestine is not the porch of spirits lingering." The seventh of its eight stanzas centers on a ring of sun-worshipers who “shall know well the heavenly fellowship/ Of men that perish,” and this poem asks in another section "What is divinity if it can come/ Only in silent shadows and in dreams?" The female figure described in the work is told “Death is the mother of beauty,” and is persuaded to prefer “Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair” to the “Dominion of the blood and sepulchre."  Championing the “Complacencies of the peignoir,” for 10 points, name this poem which appeared in Harmonium, a work by Wallace Stevens.

This people had important religious sites at Chalcatongo and Achiutla. One state created by members of this people conquered several Chatino and Chontale cities and was centered at Tututepec. An art style is co-named for these people and the neighboring Puebla, and under their ruler Atonal, their city of Coixtlahuaca was conquered by Tlacaelel on behalf of (*) Moctezuma I. They created a standardized system of deerskin records which resulted in the creation of the Bourbon, Borgia, and Nuttall codices, the last of which records the exploits of their ruler Eight Deer, who ruled from Tilantongo. This people was conquered by Pedro de Alvarado, though they are more associated with their own incursions in a region to their south, which allowed them to take control of Mitla as well as the city of Monte Alban. For 10 points, name this Mesoamerican people of the Oaxaca Valley who overran the Zapotecs.

A Gregory Schufreider paper considers the Logic of this concept arguing it arises from a gap in rationality, while Westphal and Cherry quote Chagall to show the artistic life lacks this. They dismiss Thomas Nagel's endorsement of irony in the face of this concept, which he says arises because the thoughts that make our own projects meaningful vanish from the "external perspective." The most famous treatment of this concept argues that one must "say yes" and become "master of one's own days" in the face of it. (*) Also addressed in Letters to a German Friend, that essay considers the only "truly philosophical problem," rejecting suicide as a viable way to escape this. The "man" and "creation" of this type are considered in that work, the Myth of Sisyphus.  Associated with Camus, for 10 points, identify this existentialist concept describing the ridiculousness of human life.

Price et al. demonstrated the existence of this phenomenon using the specially designed R/V Flip, and Kenneth Hunkins was the first to report its observation during work on the AIDJEX project. The velocity given by this phenomenon is the product of boundary constant B, the exponential of negative gamma z, and the exponential of negative i gamma z, where z is (*) depth, though depth-independent geostrophic velocity is often added to its vector velocities due to a horizontal pressure gradient. Commonly measured under pack ice and plotted on a hodograph, it is produced by balancing wind stress with the depth-integrated Coriolis force, causing a left deflection in the southern hemisphere and a right deflection in the northern. For 10 points, name this flow pattern consisting of a downward cycling of successive current velocity vectors in the ocean, the key to its namesake transport, named for a Swedish physicist.

answer: {Ergativity} [or {Ergative}-{Absolutive} or {Ergative}-{Nominative}]

According to a hypothesis proposed in On the Nature of Grammatical Relations by Alec Marantz, this concept is found in the D-structure level in Government and Binding Theory. Based in large part on the work done by Uhlenbeck, this concept has been theorized to have originally been the basis for Proto-Indo-European, based on the suppletion in certain pronouns and based on a discrepancy between animate and inanimate nouns. Several Australian languages show a split, using this system for nouns, but a competing one for pronouns. In English, this property is found in a certain class of verbs concerned with statal changes, such as the verb “break”, in which the agency of the subject, or lack thereof, reflects the transitivity of the verb. Most famously found in the Caucasian languages and Basque, this is, for 10 points, what syntactic system, which identifies the subject of an intransitive verb with the object of a transitive verb, a system in opposition to Nominative-Accusative languages?

One ruler of this nation repudiated the Constitution of 1840 and his death brought to power a figure known as “Whiskey Bill.” One treaty was negotiated with this nation by Thomas ap Catesby Jones, and it saw gunpoint diplomacy by Cyrille Laplace to stop persecution of Catholics. A man posing as the High Priest of Melchizedek set himself up as leader of a (*) "Mormon kingdom" in this nation before being excommunicated; that man was Walter Murray Gibson. Some rebellions here were led by Robert Wilcox, and the Blount and Morgan Reports investigated American intervention in this nation in support of an 1887 document drafted by Lorrin Thurston. That document, known as the "bayonet" constitution, was forced on King David Kalakaua by people such as Sanford Dole.

In Hinduism, some devotees of the goddess Bahuchara perform this action, in imitation of the act which allowed for Bahuchara's deification, while the denial that the Prophet makes of a request by Hadrat Abu Hurrayrah are the grounds for prohibiting this action in Islam. In his De Cultu Feminarum, Tertullian goes on a lengthy excursus on this subject, even going so far as to claim that Jesus himself had undergone this action; this act was also prohibited in the first canon of the (*) First Council of Nicaea, though, having taken Matthew 19:12 literally, Montanus, Origen, and others were said to have done it out of religious zeal. March 24, sometimes known as the “Day of Blood” saw the creation of a group of priests known as the “galli” through this activity, which was done in imitation of Attis and in honor of Kybele. For 10 points, name this action, which was undergone unwillingly by men such as Peter Abelard.

answer: {Rubisco} [or {Ribulose}-{1,5}-{bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase}]

Recent discoveries suggest that a nano anatase-titanium dioxide complex promotes the formation of this enzyme and its activating complex. That activating enzyme belongs to the AAA+ family of proteins and facilitates the removal of d-hamamelonic acid phosphate. The C-terminal domains of its large subunits exhibit a characteristic ?/? barrel, and its structure was resolved using its transition state analog (*) CABP. The epsilon-amino group of its Lys-334 residue co-ordinates with a magnesium ion stabilizes the transition state of its second partial reaction, wherein an ene-diolate reacts with either of its two common substrates. Organisms exhibiting Kranz anatomy use an analogous protein called PEP Carboxylase instead of this protein. For 10 points, identify this enzyme which facilitates the rate determining step of the Calvin cycle.

One dubious source suggests that a triumph of this man featured the stag-pulled chariot of the Goth king Cannabas, and like his immediate predecessor, this man is sometimes implicated in giving faulty information during the revolt of Aureolus, leading to another predecessor's assasination. Possibly tied to his changes in silver coinage, this figure was faced with the rebellion of minters in Rome on the Caelian Hill, led by Felicissimus. A defeat of the (*) Juthungi and Alemanni in northern Italy at the Battle of Fano prompted this man to construct his namesake fortifications at Rome, the first walls around the city since Augustus's rise, and this man defeated Septimius Zabdas by using a feigned rout against the clbanarii heavy cavalry, after which he established the cult of Sol Invictus. That victory at Immae was followed by one at Emesa after he took Antioch, which allowed him to capture Vallabathus, the son of Odaenathus. For 10 points, name this Roman Emperor who defeated Palmyra and its ruler Zenobia while ruling from 270 to 275.
