answer: Battle of {Breitenfeld}

After this battle the victor moved to plunder the so-called “Priest's Alley” while a detachment of his forces advanced south under von Armin.  One side marched from Düben, and prior to this battle the victor had formed alliances with William of Hesse-Kassel and Bernard of Saxe-Weimar after his enemy sacked (*) Magdeburg.  This battle saw one of the first major defeats of the tercio formation, and a cavalry charge was stopped by one of the first uses of a musket volley.  Another cavalry charge by Furstenberg drove off John George I and his Saxon troops, exposing the eventual victor's left flank.  The losers were hit by artillery fire from the rear when their own guns were taken by hakkapelittas after Banér drove off Pappenheim.  Occurring just north of Leipzig, this battle saw the defeat of the Catholic League under Tilly.  For 10 points, name this victory for Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years War.

answer: {myasthenia gravis} [accept {MG}]

This condition is sometimes mistaken for the Lambert-Eaton syndrome, which was first documented in patients with lung carcinomas who exhibited symptoms of this condition. It is diagnosed by intravenously administering edrophonium chloride in the Tensilon test. One type of it is caused by insufficient agrin activity, which leads to insufficient signaling of MuSK, and that type is the seronegative type. (*) A thymectomy is sometimes used to treat this condition, and drugs used to treat it include neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Insufficient Rapsyn function inhibits action against antibodies that attack nAchR, causing the majority of cases of it. For 10 points, name this autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors whose name means “serious muscle weakness”.

answer: Edgeworth-{Kuiper Belt}

The evolutionary-motive behavior of this region is typically modeled by hybrid symplectic/Bulirsch-Stoer integrators. Discovered using a blink comparator enhanced by several charge coupled devices, its brightness follows a negative 4 power law, and Yelle and Stansberry confirmed the variable emissivity associated with objects within it is controlled by surface ratios of alpha to beta nitrogen. (*) Secular resonances are responsible for its various gaps, including a noticeable “cliff” located at the 1:2 orbital resonance zone. The Nice model proposes that at least some of its mass was removed by gas giants, its present location being an indicator of early outmigration of the larger planets. Mostly populated by objects known as cubewanos, For 10 points, name this astronomical region containing bodies such as Sedna, Quaor, Pluto, and a billion or so short-period comets.

answer: {Falashas} [or {Beta Israel}; or {Ethiopian Jews}; do not accept “{Falashmuras}”]

Joseph Halevy was one of the first to study this group in depth, and a tradition of asceticism in this group in which monks lived in structures called tukuls was begun by Sabrah.

Tesfaye Gebre Kidan authorized the best-known policy involving these people shortly after Kasa Kabede fell out of favor.

answer: The {Sociological Imagination}

One passage in this work discusses how to “avoid furthering the bureaucratization of reason and discourse”, and an appendix to this work laments the necessity of empirical studies as well as encouraging limiting their use in the relevant discipline; that appendix is “On Intellectual Craftsmanship” and also discourages separating one's academic work from one's life. A famous passage in this work asserts that “men often feel that their private lives are a series of traps” and alternately presents the title concept as “the ability to shift from one perspective to another” and the propensity to “translate personal troubles into public issues”.

answer: Sammy {Baugh}

He holds the single season punting record with an average distance of 51.4 yards per punt, and he lettered in three sports at Sweetwater High. Following his pro career he coached the New York Titans and Oilers of the AFL and assistant coached at Tulsa, and his number is the only one officially retired by the organization with which he is most associated. He once led the league in interceptions with 11 and is still in the top 150 all time in that statistic. He threw for 40 touchdowns in three seasons and was one of the first to break the 50% completion mark during his time at TCU, and he followed that with a quickly aborted career in the Cardinals organization. Normalized for era, his 70.3% completion percentage in 1945 is the best in NFL history, and he was on the losing side of the 1943 league championship to the Bears. For 10 points, name this longtime Washington Redskin who popularized the forward pass and carried the nickname “Slinging Sammy.”

answer: Treaty of {Troyes}

The signing of this agreement was preceded by fruitless meetings at Alençon and Vernon that failed due to one party's demands for control of Ponthieu.  An action of Tanneguy du Chastel at Montereau allowed the chief beneficiary of this treaty to exceed his original demands of a return to the terms of the Treaty of (*) Bretigny.  This treaty led to the first marriage of a woman who would later secretly marry Owen Tudor.  It resulted in the creation of an office held by the Duke of Bedford, and it used as pretext one of Isabella of Bavaria's extramarital affairs.  Precipitated by the assassination of John the Fearless, this treaty was renounced in the Treaty of Arras by Philip the Good.  Argued to be a violation of Salic Law by Charles VII, for 10 points, name this treaty of the Hundred Years' War that named Henry V as heir to the French throne.

answer: {Fokker}-{Planck} equation [accept {forward Kolmogorov equation}]

The linear variety of this equation can be used to model Orenstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Long range interpartcle forces were used by Montgomery and Tidman to derive this result, and Rosenbluth, MacDonald, and Judd are responsible for another derivation applicable to plasmas. (*) Pawula's theorem involves a contradiction of the positivity of the distribution function when this equation has finite derivatives greater than 2. One of its namesakes derived it using jump moments, and the Smoluchowski equation is a generalization of this equation which describes diffusion in inhomogenous systems. It is equivalent to the Langevin equation when considering white Gaussian noise, and in the limit of large time intervals with constant stochastic term, it can be used to model Brownian motion. For 10 points, name this class of differential equations used to describe the time evolution of a particle's probability density function.

answer: {Two Dogmas} of {Empiricism}

This work concludes by asserting that pragmatism is the instrument by which man mediates his “scientific heritage” and the “continuing barrage of sensory information”. Another section of this work explains extension by positing the possible equality of the designations “creature with a heart” and “creature with a kidney.” This work's third section  contains a discussion on whether interchangeability ensures synonymity with Frege's example of the meanings of “evening star” and “morning star” with reference to the planet Venus. The author also asserts that Carnap's state descriptions and semantical rules do not provide a useful model for determining whether statements are analytic and ties verification theory to reductionism, one of the titular entities; the other refers to the perceived dichotomy of analytic and synthetic statements. For 10 points, name this paper of W.V.O Quine that attempts to correct the namesake insufficiencies of the titular philosophical school.

The Weinstock modification to this reaction can be utilized with diacids, and Ninomiya, Shiori, and Yamada introduced the use of DPPA in a one-step variation of this reaction to yield urethanes. When it occurs photochemically, it results in an unstable nitrene intermediate, which then sees a migration of the R group towards the nitrogen atom. The product of this reaction cannot be isolated via the similar Hoffmann rearrangement, which occurs in basic conditions. Darapsky and Hillers proposed a modification of this reaction to produce alpha amino-acids from ethyl acetoacetate and the thermal form of this reaction usually begins with an acyl halide which is attacked by an azide group from an azide salt. For 10 points, identify this reaction in which an acyl azide decomposes into an isocyanate.
