answer: {Astrophel} and {Stella}

According to Jonathan Crewe, the sparrow called "Syr Phip" in one section of this work stands for the poet himself. Penny McCarthy's book Pseudonymous Shakespeare argues that this work's lines "Listen then, lordings, with good ear to me/ for of my life I must a riddle tell" refer to Chaucer's tale of Sir Thopas, and allude to a forbidden relationship this work hides behind a poetic "screen." The speaker of the second poem in this work compares himself to a "slave-born Muscovite" enchained by love and laments "with a feeling skill, I paint my hell." Its twenty-fourth poem's reference to a (*) "rich foole" and its thirty-seventh poem's repetition of the word "rich" are commonly thought to allude to the identify of its central female character. After being rejected by that character, the speaker of this sonnet sequence exclaims "With how sad steps, O moon, thou climb'st the skies!" Probably about the poet's relationship with Penelope Rich, for 10 points, identify this sequence of one hundred and eight sonnets whose title characters have names meaning "star-lover" and "star," written by Philip Sidney.

answer: A* [{pronounced} “{A}-{star}”]

A type of ant colony optimization based on this algorithm has been applied by Gan et al to provide partial and negative outcome solutions to combinatorial auction maximization dilemmas. The ALPH variant of this algorithm is more adaptive and better at breaking ties than the original. Another modification has improved accuracy and is often used in AI known as the Iterative Deepening variant. The Lifelong Planning version is useful when costs are constantly changing (*) but requires a large amount of memory, while the Beam Search limits the size of its open search but requires the set to be sorted. It employs a priority queue known as the open set, and combines both a heuristic function and a cost function to balance path-finding considerations. If the heuristic function is zero, this algorithm degenerates into Dijkstra's algorithm. First developed by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael, for ten points, name this best-first graph search algorithm which seeks the least-cost path to one of several goal nodes.

Strong supporters of this ruler included V. Scschelkatov and P. F. Basmanov, and he caused a scandal when he elevated members of the low-born Nagoy family to the Boyars Council. This ruler called a Zemsky Sobor to pass a Bill of Attainder against one of his rivals for power, which was the first Zemsky Sobor in which the third estate elected their representatives, and he re-established the tradition of Yuri's Day, on which serfs could change masters. Another scandal during his reign occurred when his wife, Marina Mniszech, refused to (*) convert to the Orthodox, sparking rumors that this Tsar wanted to make Russia Catholic, and that he was an agent of King Sigismund III Vasa of Poland. This led to his defenestration by the supporters of Vasily Shuisky, who considered him an impostor. For ten points name this man who ruled Russia after Boris Gudenov by pretending to be the son of Ivan the Terrible, the first person to do so.

Kulik and Omel'yanchuk developed refinements for metallic links in these objects, while thermal fluctuations in these objects can be analyzed with the Ambegaokar-Halperin model, and irradiating one of these devices gives rise to constant voltage Shapiro steps in them. They are characterized by the overdamped and underdamped regimes of the (*) RCSJ model, while semifluxons occur in their zero-pi long variety. Shadow evaporation can be used to create them for flux qubits, and their associated constant is equal to two times e over h, making it the reciprocal of the magnetic flux quantum. The current across one of these devices is equal to the critical current times the sine of the phase difference, while two of these devices are arranged in a superconducting loop in a DC SQUID. For 10 points, name these devices defined by the current flow across a non conducting barrier between two coupled superconductors.

The most highly cited paper in bio-science publishing, which was written by O. H. Lowry, characterizes a method which uses a derivative of this compound called Folin's reagent to determine protein concentration. Heating the sodium salt of this compound in high pressure carbon dioxide and subsequently treating the intermediate with sulfuric acid is used to synthesize salicylic acid in the Kolbe-(*) Schmitt method. One industrial method of synthesizing it involves the addition of propylene to yield the intermediate which names the process, and subsequently involves the peroxidation and treatment of that intermediate, cumene, to yield this compound. A defunct method of synthesizing this compound sees the chlorination of its precursor which is then hydrolyzed, regenerating the hydrochloric acid; that process, named for Hooker and Raschig, uses benzene as the starting material. For 10 points, identify this compound which features a hydroxyl group bonded to benzene, with formula C6H5OH.

Rhabdomyolysis is seen in patients with Tarui's disease and McArdle's disease because enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of this compound are deficient or dysfunctional. One enzyme which regulates its biosynthesis also appears in the Wnt signalling pathway, wherein that enzyme phosphorylates beta-catenin. Degradation of this molecule does not occur in patients suffering from von (*) Gierke's disease. The degradation of this molecule normally occurs by removal of monomers at its nonreducing ends by a pyridoxal phosphate intermediate. An oxocarbonium intermediate derived from UDP-glucose results in a linear polymer connected by ?-1,4 linkages, while a branching enzyme is required for its ?-1,6 glycosidic bonds. Insulin favors its synthesis while increased glucagon leads to its breakdown. For 10 points, name this polysaccharide used to store glucose in muscle and liver cells.
