One writing of this religious group cautions those “that call themselves lovers of the Ancient Beauty” and encourages the pursuits of knowledge while condemning “sciences that begin with words and end with words”. Another set of writings of this group includes sections named for the titular objects, including those of (*) wonderment, contentment, and “true poverty and absolute nothingness.” In addition to the Seven Valleys and the six taraji, The Promise of World Peace was also written by an important figure in its early history, and an important observation of its followers is the Nineteen Day Feast. The “continental counselors” and the Hands of the Cause of God are organs of this religion, whose chief governing body is the Universal House of Justice. Shoghi Effendi led this group, an outgrowth of the Bab'ist sect, after the death of its founder, Nirza Hussein Ali Nuri. For 10 points, name this inclusive religion founded in the 19th century.

answer: {Catecholamines}

Tolcapone and entecapone are useful inhibitors for an enzyme that facilitates methylation of these compounds' ring structures, while pteridine is a necessary cofactor for the enzyme that begins their biosynthesis. The clonidine suppression test limits natural production of this class of compounds to identify the presence of pheochromocytomas, which release these compounds. In addition to (*) COMT, another class of enzyme acting on this class of compounds facilitates oxidative deamination to produce either DOMA or DOPEG, called monoamine oxidases. Biosynthesis of these compounds begins with the hydroxylation and subsequent decarboxylation of tyrosine in chromaffin cells. For 10 points, name this class of compounds with namesake dihydroxybenzene groups, including the neurotransmitters and hormones in the sympathetic nervous system such as epinephrine and dopamine.

In one myth, this deity seduced a wanderer, so that the other gods cut off that wanderer's head and replaced it with a scorpion. According to the Florentine Codex, one god strongly associated with this deity was said to preside over sweat baths. That deity was said to have been created when a war god flayed a certain princess, who then apotheosized. Under one of this deity's epithets, this deity was portrayed as a series of siblings, while in another incarnation she is described as the Mother of the Gods, and protected midwives and fortune tellers. In addition to her epithet Ixcuinan, this goddess was, with (*) Tezcatlipoca, one of the two divinities of confession. This goddess gave birth to the flower goddess Xochipilli and the maize god Centeotl, and although this goddess could be confessed to only once in a lifetime, that confession would absolve the confessor of a certain capital crime. This goddess was described as a cotton wearing, skin-carrying, child-eating hag in her traditional form. For 10 points, name this crazy Aztec goddess, who presided over crazy sex, dirt, and gambling, as well as STDs.

The HINT program is a computational tool used to map this property of molecules using the “fragment” approach to assigning numerical values for this property developed by Hansch and Leo. One plot which is used to predict the antigenic sites of a protein uses this property, since it usually displays a local maximum at antigenic sites, That plot is called the Hopp-Woods plot, which used less frequently than the (*) Kyte-Doolittle plot. A global index of this property for a given molecule is called ILM, which is a function of the distance between a solute atom and the solvent atom, and in drug design, this property is described by the partition coefficient of a system. Most scales only take into account side chains of amino acids while calculating it. For 10 points, identify this property which describes the degree to which a given molecule loves or hates water.

answer: {Ideals}

Tsang showed that invertible content examples of this construct characterize Gaussian polynomials. Bézout names domains for which finitely generated ones imply principally generated ones. The maximum number of strict inclusions of them in certain groups is given by the Krull Dimension. (*) Buchberger's algorithm finds bases for one of these sets; that output is known as the Gröbner basis. For Prüfer varieties, every finitely generated one is invertible. Artinian rings add a decreasing condition on chains of these to an increasing condition that is the subject of Hilbert's Basis Theorem and is named for Noether. If the product of any two elements of a ring is itself an element of that ring, then that ring's one of these is said to be prime, whereas the smallest one is considered maximal. For 10 points, identify these subgroups, named by Kummer, that are invariant under multiplication and central to commutative ring theory.

This book uses the examples of a woman with four suitors and Toscanini's retirement from the Symphony of the Air to argue that one has no right to any say in decisions which others have the right to make in its section “Having a Say Over What Affects You.” It notes that orchestra members are “ordered about by their conductor” and suggests that the relationship between subordination and low self esteem may be correlative rather than causative in “Meaningful Work.” In addition to defending moral “side constraints” it argues for the superiority of “filter devices” as opposed to “design devices “and presents a (*) thought experiment in which people sell stock in themselves in "Demoktesis." It argues that we desire to "live ourselves" and criticizes hedonism with the experience machine thought experiment. This work claims that a titular concept arises through the invisible hand from dominant protection agencies and uses the Wilt Chamberlain argument that "Liberty Upsets Patterns," to defend the entitlement theory of justice. For 10 points, name this attack on John Rawls' A Theory of Justice, written by Robert Nozick.

This polity's bureaucracy was headed by the Vuzorg Farmadar, and other important officials included the Vastrioshansalar minister of agriculture and the Mobadan Mobad, the government's religious leader. One leader of this polity formed an alliance with the nomad king Grombates and had earlier laid siege to Singara. This polity engaged in some religious perseuction under the priest Kirder, and the Lakhmids became a vassal kingdom of this polity, which had a victory at (*) Callinicum under Kavadh I. Its founder was a hereditary guardian of the Anahita fire in Istakhr, and founded a namesake city at Ardashir-Kwarrah. More notably, it was ruled by the victor at the Battle of Edessa, who supposedly made a human footstool out of the Roman emperor Valerian. Shapur I ruled this empire, which like its predecessor was Zoroastrian and governed from Ctesiphon.

Along with Buttiker and Pretre, this scientist's name indicates a theory by which the local density of states may be defined in terms of the scattering matrix in a Larmor clock, which leads to a generalized conductance equation. His name is also attached to a set of field equations which give an alternate explanation of charge carrier-radiation equilibrium to the linear Bohr-Infield Theory along with Landé. (*) A phenomenon named for him explains the discrepancy of the g-factor in the Uhlenbeck-Goudsmit expression for the magnetic moment of an electron, while a theory co-named for him and Fermi relies on an equation for the ground state density derived without solution of the Schrödinger Equation. His most famous contribution involves the inertial reference frames of a particle in a circular path, in which a vector does not remain fixed. For 10 points, name this British physicist, a Columbia professor whose name is attached to a type of relativistic precession.

Resonant cyclotron scattering modeling of the nonthermal spectra of these objects implies a plasma shell density up to four orders of magnitude higher than the Goldreich-Julian electron density of their less energetic versions. Local effects associated with them include Klein-Nishina pair creation, vacuum polarization birefringence, and Compton scattering suppression. (*) In 2008, fast optical flaring was confirmed in one of these objects, SWIFT J195509+261406. The first ring of matter around one was observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope, and absorption of their energy by these or by their coronae following crustal equilibrium collapse and fracturing is a proposed mechanism for the soft gamma repeater emission associated with them. FTP, name this type of neutron star proposed by Robert Duncan and Christopher Thompson, also responsible for X-ray Pulsar Emissions, and powered by the decay of magnetic fields on the order of 10 gigateslas.
