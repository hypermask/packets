Along with Sara Eisner and Robert Robinson, he conducted an experiment that supported the practice of jurors taking notes during a trial. Along with Martin Seligman, he included factors like observer discomfort, suffering, and maladaptiveness in his seven features of abnormality. The follow-up to this psychologist's most notable experiment involved a certain institution identifying 41 confederates out of a possible zero. That experiment, which bears his name, featured several patients being described as "in remission" after their release from a hospital and was detected by patients in mental treatment facilities, but not the staff thereof. For 10 points name this Stanford psychologist whose namesake experiment involved sending normal people into mental hospitals and who published “On Being Sane in Insane Places” as a result.

answer: {Castor et Pollux} [or {Castor} and {Pollux}]

A tambourin from its prologue would be used by the composer in his Pièces de clavecin en concerts, but much of the prologue was changed in the opera's revival along with the introduction of Cléone.  One unmelodic chorus in this opera is 'Brisons tous nos fers' which is sung by demons, while Chromatic ritornellos characterize another chorus of 'Que tout gémisse'.   In act 4, one of  title characters sings ‘Séjour de l'éternelle paix' while in pain of being alone, and another title character earlier sings ‘Nature, Amour, qui partage mon coeur'. In act 5 a planet sings 'Brillez, astres nouveaux' about the fates of the title characters, but its most famous aria is (*) Tristes apprêts, sung by Telaira over the loss of her loved one.  For ten points identify this Tragédie en musique with libretto by Pierre-Joseph Bernard and music by Jean-Philippe Rameau about the Gemini twins.

The protagonist of this work remarks that his home is a place neither for the public nor literature after learning that it has been turned into his town's public library, while the effeminate mannerisms of another character lead the protagonist to compare him to an “unmentionable monkey.” At one point in this novel the protagonist longs to be reading a story by Theodor Storm, and after another character invites him to go riding the protagonist notes that he would rather read a book about horses than ride one. He later laments his inability to interest that character in (*) Schiller's Don Carlos. He notes that wearing a velveteen jacket does not make one an artist after his fastidious appearance is criticized by Lisabetta Ivanovna, who later accompanies him North to a resort in Aalsgaard, Denmark. There he recalls accidentally doing the female part of a dance in Herr Knack's class after seeing his boyhood friend, Hans Hansen, and his secret flame, Ingeborg Holm. For ten points name this novella by Thomas Mann.

answer: {Substance P} [or {SP}]

The coexistance of this neurotransmitter and serotonin in certain dorsal raphe cells is an important example of the violation of Dale's principle. This neurotransmitter can activate the transcription of EGR-1 and it is synthesized in the ipsilateral caudate-putamen originating neurons, which interact with dopaminergic cells.  There is evidence of link between a lack of this in pancreatic nerves and some forms of diabetes and it is involved in the initiation and execution of (*) vomiting. Receptors for it include neurokinin 1 receptor, which is a tachykinin receptor and capsaicin causes a release and depletion of this neurotransmitter. Naked mole rats lack pathways involving this neurotransmitter, whose most important role comes from its effect on the dorsal root ganglion during nociception.  For 10 points, identify this 11 amino acid neurotransmitter discovered by Ulf von Euler, the first peptide neurotransmitter to be found.

An individual who would become king as a result of this event was conceived by a man covered in gold that arrived in a silver boat and asked his mother “Shall I have an hour of lovemaking with you?” A golden ring given by that father would later be used to trigger the second event of this name, which resulted in the secret of agriculture being revealed by Bres. One of these events took place at Cong and one figure that took part in that event lost his (*) arm, but had it replaced by the physician Dian Cecht, earning the epithet “of the silver arm.” Another figure involved in the second event of this name possessed a destructive eye that required four men to open using an eyelid ring and was known as Balor, grandson of Net.  Other prominent figures who took part in these two events include Nuada, Morrigan, Dagda, and a figure that wielded the Gorias spear, Lug. For 10 points, give the common name shared by these two battles in which the Tuatha Dé Danann fought Fir Bolg and the Fomairi.

answer: {Rossby} Waves [prompt on “{Planetary Waves}”]

The interaction of this phenomenon and turbulence causing the destruction coherent vortices is known as the Rhines effect. The ratio of the square root of gravity and height to two times the rate of rotation gives their associated deformation. In the hydrosphere, they are best observed on a Hovmöller Diagram, where they appear as diagonal associations of surface height anomalies (*), and the 1993 northward push of the Kuroshio Current is due to this phenomenon, which can take years to cross an ocean. Partially responsible for atmospheric hotspots on Jupiter, omega blocks may form on Earth as the distance between their peaks narrows. They may appear as a baroclinic variety, though usually manifest as barotropic disturbances which interfere with the ascending limbs of Ferrell Cells. Its namesake parameter is the northward variation in the Coriolis parameter, and they move westward relative to the current in the Northern Hemisphere. FTP, name these large waves in the polar jet stream or westerlies.

The only two eyewitness accounts of this event come from Antonfrancesco Cirni and Francisco Balbi di Correggio.  A planned outflanking maneuver during this engagement was ruined when Chevalier de Guiral opened fire at point blank range from Fort St. Angelo, although the attackers had slightly more success when assaulting from Mt. Sciberras.  Reinforcements under Don Garcia de Toledo arrived from (*) Sicily in time to intercept the fleeing attackers, though they had already taken Fort St. Elmo.

A common symbol in paintings of this title is a pair of scissors, some pieces of paper and other items  hanging in the background, while in one depiction of the crucification is on the top of some shelves with books next to it and birds can be seen outside the windows above.  In two depictions, a hat next to an hour glass is also on the wall, while one of them has a large pear shaped gourd hangs from the celling, referencing a debate the subject had over whether kikayon should be translated as gourd or ivy. A skull lies on the windowsill above a sleeping dog, which is awake and staring at the subject in one depiction, while while Ghirlandaio's in the Ognissanti has worn (*) Latin text at the top and has the subject looking towards the viewer. Fledglings are an addition in one of the works to the image of the peacock in the foregrounds, but most of them have lions, one of which is in the rear part of the large open room in Antonello da Messina depiction.  At the center of the paintings is the title subject hard at work over a book.  For ten points identify this painting subject, exemplified by the work of Lucas Cranach the Elder and Albrecht Dürer of the translator of the Vulgate in his workspace.

answer: {Liouville's} theorem [do not accept {Sturm}-{Liouville} or other wrong things]

Wigner pointed out a theoretical violation of this theorem which led to the discovery of dissipative effects rather than cooling as the method of particle compaction in storage rings. Another violation in which a pure quantum member of a system becomes a mixed system by crossing an event horizon led to the formulation of the dualism corollary of the anti de-Sitter Space / conformal field theory correspondence. (*) Application of this tenet to unperturbed thermal and electrical systems in equilibrium yields the Green-Kubo relations, and in ergodic theory it implies that the Lebesgue Measure is invariant. It may be derived by taking the time derivative of the Jacobian of the transformation, and reducing by the appropriate matrix. FTP, name this theorem of classical mechanics that describes the time preservation of phase space volume for Hamiltonian systems, named for a French mathematician.

answer: {disproportionation} [prompt on {oxidation}-{reduction}, prompt on {redox}]

This term describes a process which occurs when the disperse phase of a colloid is moderately soluble in the continuous phase, which results in the passage of from a small bubble to a larger, adjacent bubble. That process is alternatively called Ostwald ripening or isothermal distillation. Along with bubble formation, creaming, and drainage, that process with this name represents one of the criteria necessary for the formation and retention of foam. Another form of this process occurs when a given state lies above the line formed by connecting its adjacent points on a (*) Frost diagram, since that state has a higher average Gibbs Free energy. When it occurs with free radicals, it is usually called dismutation. For 10 points, name this process that occurs when a species undergoes simultaneous oxidation and reduction to produce two different products such as the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.

This thinker argued that the “form of the body” and the “animating form” are separate and argued against universal hylemorphism.  At times both for and against intellectual intuitive cognition in his abstractive versus intuitive cognition theory and he argued against Henry of Ghent's version of Divine Illumination.  He believed that a thing must be per se notae ex terminis in order to be natural law, in which he did an analysis of the Ten Commandments. He made a commentary on Porphyry's Isagoge, while his Expositio and Parva logicalia are both in part on the works of Aristotle.  His belief that a circle of causes is impossible and that accidental chains of causality require an ordered series play a part in his argument for an efficient cause, which along with a first in final causality and pre-eminence leads to his triple primacy proof of the existence of God.  For ten points identify this philosopher whose work Pius IX used in the Ineffabilis Deuson immaculate conception, and who commented on Lombard's Sentences in Ordinatio.

This event caused the future Baron Sydenham to emigrate to Canada, and this event was followed by a "fag-end period" that was marked by the Syria question.  It was caused by the weak support of a certain leader's plan for suspending the consitution of Jamaica as well as the unpopularity of Home Secretary John Russell. The leader at the center of this conflict later admitted to personal secretary Sir Anthony Bigge that "perhaps I should act differently if it was all to be done again", although that ruler's actions were based on the loyalty in the earlier (*) Flora Hastings Affair of people like Baroness Lehzen and Lady Portman.  Eventually rectified by Prince Albert after the queen married, this event marked a break in the government of Lord Melbourne and occurred when Victoria refused to meet the demands of the proposed new the Prime Minister, Robert Peel, causing him to decline the office. For 10 points, name this 1839 event involving the attempted removal of Whig ladies as ladies-in-waiting.
