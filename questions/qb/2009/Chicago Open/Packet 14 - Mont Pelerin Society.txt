answer: {neutrino oscillations} [accept {change} in {flavors} or {neutrino flavor oscillations} until mentioned]

The Kimura-Takamura-Yokomakura equation calculates the probability of this occurrence in matter of constant density. The debated Klapdor-Kleingrothaus experiment, if duplicated, may obviate the most widely accepted reasons for this phenomenon, which is implied by the nonzero phase factors of Makai-Nakagawa-Sakata matrices, by proving the subjects in question (*) annihilate themselves during germanium-76 decay. High energy versions of this phenomenon occur via Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein resonance in the sun, and atmospheric angular variations in the muon rate are central to the balance of subtypes of the particles involved, which suggests a non-zero mass for them. First predicted by Bruno Pontecorvo, for 10 points, name this phenomenon first observed at the Super-Kamiokande observatory by which certain uncharged leptons may change flavors.

answer: {Édouard}-{Victoire}-{Antoine Lalo}

He wrote a piece titled La mère et l'enfant, originally for piano four hands, and contains a section called “Petite Romance.” He based his Six melodies on poems by Victor Hugo, and his Trio in C minor shows some influence by Beethoven. Arthur Coquard finished this composer's four-act opera La Jacquerie, and this composer also wrote a ballet that contains a “Pas des cymbals” and some “Danses marocaines.” One of his operas was based on Schiller's Die Vershwörung des Fiesco zu Genua, and another of his operas sees Magared betraying her father's city to Karnac and is based on a Breton legend. He worked with Adolphe Fischer on one of his better known pieces, and another may have anticipated the release of Bizet's Carmen a month later with a first movement habanera. For 10 points, identify this French composer of the ballet Namouna, the operas Fiesque and Le roi d'Ys, and the Cello Concerto in D minor, perhaps best known for a piece dedicated to Sarasate, Symphonie Espagnole.

answer: {Rye} House Plot

This event was discovered by Leoline Jenkins, and a report on it was written by his successor, the Earl of Sunderland. One participant in this event gave a speech in which he claimed “none comes into the world with a saddle on his back, neither any booted and spurred to ride him”; that man was Richard Rumbold. This event grew out of meetings at the house of a London wine merchant named Sheppard. Thomas Ferguson and Robert Armstrong were executed in its aftermath along with the author of the Discourses Concerning Government, (*) Algernon Sidney.  It was sparked by the failure of the Exclusion Bill, and it designed to kill its targets on their return from a Newmarket horse meet.  It resulted in the suicide of the Earl of Essex, though more notably implicated was the Duke of Monmouth, who went into exile.  Actually real unlike the Popish Plot, for 10 points, name this plot to kill Charles II and the future James II at a namesake Hertfordshire dwelling.

answer: Paul's Epistle/Letter to the {Romans}

Karl Barth claimed that church history was "utterly weak" since the distinction between God and human is too great one work with this title. Another work with this name cites Hosea to show that "the Lord is the Lord of all". That second work's author asks "Who will rescue me from this body of death?" in a section that claims that "apart from the law, sin lies dead". This work's thirteenth chapter implores its readers to submit to existing authorities, for they "have all been instituted by God", and its first chapter accuses "women [who] exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural" of giving into "degrading passions" and being "God-haters". It states that "real circumcision is a matter of the heart", alluding to its author's disagreement with Peter, since the promise of Abraham came to him not through good works but by "righteousness of faith". For 10 points identify this epistle from which Martin Luther formed his doctrine of justification through faith alone, the first letter of Paul in the New Testament.

answer: {Woodward's} rules [or {Woodward}-{Feiser} rules]

One generally observes a hypsochromic shift when applying these to systems without planarity, while a bathochromic shift is observed when these are applied to coplanar systems exhibiting ring strain. They are also not very accurate when applied to systems exhibiting considerable branching. Their namesake, along with Moffit, Moscowitz, Klyne, and Djerassi published the "octant rule," which were correlations between the ORD (*) spectra of saturated ketones and their structures, and 5 nm are added for exocyclic double bonds according to them. They assign a value of 217 nanometers for conjugated dienes and , thus making them useful for predicting the wavelength of peak absorption for a chromophore in UV-Vis spectroscopy. For 10 points, identify this set of rules, which are sometimes also named for the people who categorized them, Mary and Louis Fieser.

answer: {Rush}

Its name is shared by a 2003 trance album by Darude. One of its most famous songs opens with a repeated two-measure sequence of a bass drum beat on the first beat of the first measure and the second beat of the second measure and a tom-tom beat on the third beat of both measures. Its most famous album features Hugh Syme's graphic of "Starman," a naked man seen from behind standing with his arms outstretched in front of a seemingly oncoming pentagram. Its 1984 album Grace Under Pressure incorporated ska and reggae influences, which can be heard in such songs as "Distant Early Warning." In 1974, it established its current lineup when original drummer John Rutsey left the band. The first track, "Far Cry," on its latest album became a modest success. That album, 2007's "Snakes and Arrows," resulted in a tour that is still going on, unlike an album that spawned the single "Closer to the Hydrant," the nonexistent concept album "Dogopoly."  Its most recognizable hits came from 1980's Permanent Waves and 1981's Moving Pictures. For 10 points, name this three-member band from from Canada, composed of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart and known for such hits as Tom Sawyer and The Spirit of Radio.

answer: {Rational Choice} Theory

Green and Shapiro have argued in a paper titled after the "Pathologies" of this concept that its empirical value is limited. Blau attempted to address one problem of this theory by claiming that people are inclined to accept inconvenience if it came as a part of a longer chain of actions. The problem that he was attempting to solve was that of Norms and Obligations, while several theorists have attempted to improve conceptions of this theory by adding variables for promises and threats. The foundational theory for this concept came from a work of George Caspar Homans, who wrote Social Behavior: Its Elementary Forms, which drew heavily form the psychology of Skinner. This theory assumes completeness and transitivity of preferences, with the result that all participants can make a personally consistent ranking. For ten points, identify this concept from economics and political science that states that participants in a system nearly always make decisions that follow their best interests.

answer: The {Crime} of {Sylvester Bonnard}

Quizbowlers might sympathize with the narrator of this work, who recalls that at the age of eight he “longed impatiently for the day (which alas! has come) when a strong beard should bristle on my chin.” Many years later that man publishes a study on the fertilization of flowers. One character who models a statue of an ink-throwing fairy is treated much better at school when it is discovered that another character is a Member of the Institute. The protagonist helps the student Henri Gelis with his thesis and later sells most of his collection to fund the young man's marriage to the ward of the title character. The Russian Prince Trepof travels the world building his matchbox collection in this novel, and the title character is surprised to find that the Princess Trepof once lived in poverty without even the means to buy firewood in the winter. For 10 points, name this novel where the gentle old title character abducts the red-handed Jeanne from her notary guardian Maitre Mouche, an 1881 work about a book lover by Anatole France.

Two indicators of these systems are the K-sub-5 band and the [Om]A5007 emission line, and complex X-ray variability below 2KeV indicates that high accretion rates in some examples support ionized reprocessors. All of them contain core temperatures high enough to produce tridecavalent iron, (*) while emission from these bodies in the radio spectrum is due to synchrotron emission from their cores. Doppler broadening between the bands of their accretion disks provides one method of classifying them, though the unified classification is based upon hydrogen emission in the either infrared or UV, and is composed of Type I and Type II examples. For 10 points, name these intermediate systems between galaxies and quasars, which are radio galaxies that contain extremely active central nuclei, named for an American astronomer.

One of its proponents criticized behaviorist analyses of language in his magnum opus. That man's purported misreading of Saussure's Course in General Linguistics contributed to The Visible and the Invisible, while a hermeneutic approach to it was advocated in Being and Time. When preceded by "analytic," the philosophical movement named after it ontologically reduces particular things to the human experiences of those things, a radical departure from earlier practices of the disciplineand Hegel's methodology for it defined criteria for certain knowledge and independent objecthood.  This philosophical discipline was advanced a work which discussed the role of epoche in philosophy and was entitled Ideas, but it began in an earlier work by the same author, Philosophical Investigations. For 10 points, name this philosophical discipline and movement, which studies consciousness and the experiences of the individual, which was discussed in relation to perception by Merleau-Ponty and in relation to Spirit by Hegel.

answer: {Adolphe Adam}

This man gained early success with some piano transcriptions on themes from the comic opera La dame blanche and the one-act vaudeville show The American Uncle. Minor successes by this man include La Fille du Danube and Les Mohicans, and The Dark Diamond was a disappointing follow-up to his “military spectacle,” His First Campaign. This man wrote the popular opera-ballet The Hamadryads, though better regarded was his ballet The Corsair. His major attempt at “grand opera,” Richard in Palestine, bombed at the box office, while a libretto by Eugene Scribe that was originally intended for Daniel Aubert provided the text for his finest opera, Giralda. This composer is much better-known for a work in which the title character encounters a gang of feminist elemental spirits in the forest who want to murder her boyfriend. For ten points name this prolific composer best-known for the ballet Giselle.
