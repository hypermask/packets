answer: Philip Morris {Glass}

One of this man's compositions contains a sole character named “M” who hears aliens tell him “It is pointless to remember.” One of his operas includes a crowd of men wearing top hats and gas masks passing around cannonballs until they suffocate, and also contains a scene in which a crowd is obliterated after a rocket blasts off from the Statue of Liberty's head.  In addition to that work that juxtaposes an (*) ice-age landing of aliens with Christopher Columbus's trip, he set poems like “Aunt Rose” and “Father Death Blues” as songs in another opera. This man composed an opera that begins by depicting the “Kuru field of justice,” and another of his operas alternates between Year 17 and present-day, in addition to works like 1000 Airplanes on the Roof and The Voyage.  For 10 points, name this composer who used the poetry of the autistic Christopher Knowles as the basis for the “knee plays” that make up one of his operas, the composer of Hydrogen Jukebox, Satyagraha, Akhnaten, and Einstein on the Beach.

answer: Loránd [or Roland] von {Eotvos} [accept in either order]

Ramsay and Shields added a term that subtracts six Kelvin to this scientist's namesake rule, which relates the same temperature dependence as is considered by the Guggenheim-Katayama equation. This man created an experimental setup of two suspended masses on a horizontal rod to show that gravitational and inertial mass were equivalent, (*) and the formula two-omega-u-cosine-phi represents an effect named for him, which corrects for the fact that gravity measurements are affected when a ship sails east instead of west. His name is also born by a dimensionless number used in conjunction with the Morton number to describe the shape of moving bubbles. For 10 points, name this man whose namesake rule relates surface tension to temperature, and who created a torsion balance to prove the weak equivalence principle, perhaps the most prominent Hungarian baron in physics.

answer: {Henry Sidgwick}

Bart Schultz wrote about this man's feminism, and titled a book [this man]: Eye of the Universe.  One of this man's works notably claimed that the only thing that could ultimately be judged to be good was a mode of human existence. He wrote about the undesirability of "The Morality of Strife" and "The Ethics of Relgious Conformity" in another one of his works, and a further work by this man discusses the importance of the Individualistic Minimum. The author of Practical Ethics and The Elements of Politics, one of this man's most notable students was the author of Principia Ethica, George Edward Moore, although his own best known work claimed that its title constructions came out of a series of judgments which didn't only apply in the case of consequences and introduced the term the "Dictate of Reason."

One attempt to end this conflict created a Council of State that was last led by Ruth Perry, following other countries' attempts to mediate this conflict through such agreements as the Accra Clarification of the Akosombo Agreement. Starting as an ethnic conflict among the Gio, Mano, and Krahn, it escalated after the assassination of the head of the People's Redemption Council. A group involved in this conflict split during this event into two factions, led respectively by G.V. Kromah and (*) Roosevelt Johnson, and another participant in this conflict claimed that the Devil called him on the telephone and was known to play soccer with children's heads and dress his soldiers in women's clothing, but himself was named for his lack of attire as General Butt Naked. Early during this conflict Prince Johnson killled President Samuel Doe, and it eventually saw the victory of the National Patriotic Front.

One of this man's collections contains a poem dedicated to Mickey Smith that writes the word “murder” with 49 “R”s and claims “i nevva wear neck. tie yet.”  In addition to that poem about a man who was stoned to death, appropriately titled “Stone,” he opened a long poetic work with the line “To hell / with Af- / rica / to hell / with Eu- / rope too.”  This poet symbolizes his nation's struggles with the symbol of an unfertile “rock seed,” and he claims that the effects of slavery caused the rise of a misogynist system he dubs the “manscape.”  A long poetic work by this author, the third in a trilogy with his Mother Poem and Sun Poem, ends with a section called “Xango” and recasts (*) Prospero and Caliban as a plantation owner and servant.  This author of X/Self also claims that Caribbean poets must use an amalgamation of tongues he dubs the “nation language.” For 10 points, name this author of a trilogy consisting of Rites of Passage, Masks, and Islands, the Arrivants trilogy, an author who is not George Lamming, but is from Barbados.

answer: {Casimir}-Polder Effect

In Randall-Sundrum scenarios in low energy regimes, this phenomenon's 4-dimensional version, which acts on a scalar field bounded by the Dirichlet condition, appears as a resonant mode, and the expression describing it contains an encoding term for higher dimensions. The Carugno-Onofrio experiment attained a 15% agreement with its theoretical value using a cantilever, though (*) Mohideen's method attains better agreement with a polystyrene modified Atomic Force Microscope. It may be thought of as a dielectric-specific van der Waals force, though it arises from the variation of zero-point energy over vacuum boundary fluctuations, and is typically demonstrated with perfectly flat mirrors. For 10 points, name this effect named for a Dutch dude, that describes the piconewton-scale attractive relationship between two uncharged conducting plates a vacuum.

During this man's reign, the Gregorian law code was issued, while his economic reforms included the creation of seven new mints and instituting the iugum and capitatio taxes.

This issuer of the Edict of Maximum Prices won a battle for supremacy at the (*) Margus. He rose to power after executing Aper, supposedly fulfilling a prophecy about killing a boar, during a campaign against Persia in which Numerian died mysteriously. After disposing of his rival Carinus, he established Sirmium, Trier, Milan and Nicomedia as subsidiary capitals. Lactantius was not a big fan of one of this man's policies, and he built a palace at Split in Croatia that he retired to. This emperor installed Maximian, Galerius, and Constantius Chlorus to high positions, and he instigated a major purge of Christians. For 10 points, name this Roman emperor who resolved the Crisis of the Third Century by creating the augustus-caesar system or tetrarchy.

One of these works is a list of questions beginning “This I ask thee, tell me truly,” that contains such queries as “Who is by generation the Father of Right, at the first?” and “What artist made light and darkness?” These works are based on proto-poems called “haitim,” which Martin Schwartz argues are based on concatenation because of the fact that “haitim” and the word for “fetter” come from the same root in a seminal paper about their lexical “concentric rings.”  One of them describes a conversation between the “ox-soul” and a god personified as the “ox creator.”  They describe a minister named Jamaspa and a king named Vishtaspa, the first convert to a certain religion. Their progression is interrupted by the prose “Haptanghaiti,” they make up seventeen chapters of the Yasna, and they are addressed to Ahura Mazda.  For 10 points, name these sacred hymns believed to be composed by Zoroaster himself.

Arising from the need to explain the ramifications of the Schank Algorithm, this lemma's implications, some of which it shares with Bingsjord's anonymous straw-man, refute ascriptions 1 and 2 of the concept its inventor attacks. Churchland's luminosity argument weakens its implied intuition, while Chalmer's variation extends it to qualia-preserving (*) neural nets, and the “blockhead” experiment redefines it via logical operators and a memory table. Its opponents commonly cite a weak version of the Zuse-Fredkin hypothesis known as the “systems reply,” as well as the “many mansions reply,” which its creator counters by insisting that program syntactics are insufficient for semantics.

The majority opinion in this case extensively quoted Justice Field's dissent in Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Baugh, while Justice Butler's dissent argued that the court erred in ruling on the question at hand sua sponte. The decision in this case was recently applied to claim preclusion in Semtek International Inc. v. Lockheed Martin, and it was considered in light of the seventh amendment in Gasperini v. Center for Humanities. The court first clarified the test outlined in this case as "outcome-determinative" in Guaranty Trust Co. v.
