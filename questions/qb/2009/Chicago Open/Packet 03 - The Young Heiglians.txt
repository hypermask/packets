answer: {mesocyclone} [do not accept or prompt on “{tornado}”]

The two most common paradigms used to explain this occurrence are the Lemon and Doswell Analog and the Davies-Jones Analog. The most accurate models predicting whether they descend are the Stumpf and Neural Net Algorithms. Base relations to maximum gate-to-gate velocity difference, low-level divergence and core depth are among the values typically plotted for (*) Pearson variable correlation during attempts to detect them. The identification of bounded weak echo regions in conjunction with them is associated with their most dangerous version, while excessive outflow tends to suppress them. Essentially Rankine combined vortices, they commonly form as a result of low pressure centers within gust front waves, and prominent examples may display a pendant, or “hook” echo signature. Updrafts may tilt them upright, creating features such as inflow bands, mammata, and wall clouds. FTP, name this rotating helix of opposing cold and warm air currents located in the rear flank of convective thunderstorms, from which tornadoes commonly develop.

answer: The Battle of {Dettingen}

One commander at this battle "preserved" two forces of Foot Guards by returning them to the camp before the fighting, earning him the nickname "Confectioner." That man, General Ilton, was stationed on the right, protected by the Spessart Hills, while a river comprised the left. It happened during an attempted retreat to Flanders after some unsuccessful maneuvers by the Earl of Storey, and the victorious army was cut off when several regiments occupied Aschaffenburg. A cavalry assault of the Maison du Roi failed, while the possibly-spontaneous main attack under (*) de Grammont was disorderly and retreated after a quick repulse, thus failing to close a trap set by de Noailles in the namesake west Bavarian village. Featuring Marshall Konigseck's Austrian division and a Hanoverian detachment, the winning Pragmatic Army also included a young Duke of Cumberland and the last European head of state to command in the field. For 10 Points, name this battle where George II of England headed a coalition force to victory in the War of the Austrian Succession.

answer: {William Walton}

The influence of this composer's time in Italy can be heard in the Presto capriccioso alla napolitana second movement of his violin concerto. He only finished three of the movements of his first symphony before its premiere, and the addition of the Maestoso allegro fourth movement was delayed in part by his breakup with the Princess of Erbach-Schonberg. This composer depicted a print by Thomas Rowlandson using a diatonic scherzo that quotes sea shanties in his overture Portsmouth Point, and brass fanfares represent the title figure of his Scapino Overture. This composer of the “Liverpool” symphony also set a series of Edith Sitwell poems to music in a piece with movements like “Black Mrs. Behemoth” and “Long Steel Grass,” Façade. For 10 points, name this British composer of the operas The Bear and Troilus and Cressida as well as Belshazzar's Feast.

answer: {hydrogen cyanide} [or HCN; {heck}, {even} accept {cyanide} until "{Prussic acid}"]

This compound is a primary by-product of a process developed by Jim Idol for performing the ammoxidation of propylene, the Sohio process. The platinum/rhodium gauzes used in a more common method for producing this compound tend to quickly become brittle, and that process for producing this compound involves the combustion of methane and ammonia in the presence of air. That process, named for Andrussow, differs from the Degussa process because it does not require oxygen. Less interesting ways to synthesize this compound include the catalytic dehydration of form-amide and an alternative to the Gattermann Koch synthesis, also developed by Gattermann, uses this compound rather than carbon monoxide to form an immonium intermediate, which is then oxidized to yield benzaldehyde. For 10 points, identify this compound which is sometimes called Prussic acid, a poisonous chemical with the formula HCN.

answer: The {Double}-{Dealer}

One character in this work writes a poem called “The Sillabub,” which she asks a character who constantly says “deuce take me” to review. An evil plot in this work involves a poorly-sewn sleeve designed to give the protagonist trouble donning a priest's habit, which he is given by Reverend Saygrace. Another character attempts to fall on the protagonist's sword after he rejects her, and his prevention of her suicide leads her to vow to ruin him.” Mr. Brisk cuckolds the foppish Lord Frost in this play, while the refusal of Lady Plyant to give her husband an heir leads to her all-too-easy seduction by Ned Careless. The title character frames the protagonist for cuckolding his uncle, who then agrees to disinherit the protagonist and arrange for the title character to marry Lady Plyant's stepdaughter, Cynthia. The plot unravels when Careless reveals that Lady Touchwood's lover is not Mellefont but rather Maskwell, the play's two-faced titular villain. For 10 points name this play by William Congreve.

answer: Edward {Evans}-{Pritchard}

One of this man's teachers published The Veddas and Melanesians of British New Guinea, that teacher being Charles Gabriel Seligman. During one of his military stints, this man discussed the traditions of a certain people whom he was helping in their guerilla war, The Sanusi of Cyrenaica. This thinker notably claimed that anthropologists often mistakenly attribute motivations that closely match their own culture, rather than those of their subjects, in his Theories of Primitive Religion. In more famous works, this thinker wrote about a certain Nilotic people in their Kinships and marriage rituals, the Nuer, as well as discussing a mischievous god figure and the prominence of the supernatural in another culture.  For ten points, identify this anthropologist who wrote several tracts about a certain central African tribe, including The Zande Trickster and Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande.

One of these figures served as an arbitrator in a dispute between Helios and Poseidon over the isthmus of Corinth and has an alternate name that means “goatish.” That figure was married to Kymopoleia, with whom he sired the nymph Oiolyka. One of them was called upon to aid Thetis in releasing Zeus from the chains with which he was bound by Hera and Apollo, and these figures are sometimes identified with the Tritopatores. Guarded for a time by the monster Campe, they reside at one point in an area surrounded by walls and a bronze gate built by Poseidon. The constellation Ara is associated with these figures, one of whom shares his name with a figure whose “ring” is the subject of a parable in Plato's Republic. The bottom of the sea is home to one of these creatures, while the other two, Kottos and Gyges, guard the titans in Tartarus whom they defeated by using their most distinctive features. For ten points name these three monsters who sure can throw a lot of rocks at once.

answer: {rhodopsins} [prompt on {opsin} until "{transducin};" accept: {arrestins} until mentioned; accept: {rhodopsin kinase} until "{kinases}"]

Oguchi's disease occurs due to a mutation in genes encoding for arrestins or for kinases which act on this protein. This protein exists in "batho""meta-I" and "meta-II" states, the last of which is thought to require the clockwise outward rotation of helix III and helix VI, and like other proteins of its kind, it possesses a DRY/ERY consensus sequence at region which binds to transducin. The E113 residue acts as a counterion and they have characteristic lysine-296 residue which has a Schiff-base linkage with its cofactor. The activation of this protein results in the downstream increase in the activity of cGMP phosphodiesterase, and it was the first G-protein coupled receptor to have its structure revealed. The isomerization of its chromophore into the all-trans form occurs when photons strike the chromophore. For 10 points, identify this protein which forms a complex with 11-cis-retinal, the primary photoreceptor protein present in rod cells.

Interference in this phenomenon arising from dissipative environments may be suppressed by a Caldeira-Leggett bath of harmonic oscillators, though microwave field perturbations in materials exhibiting it give rise to Fano-Kondo resonance, which is employed in a useful interferometer. It may occur in neutral excitons when the hole ground state changes angular momentum from L equals 0 to L equals 1, 2 or 3 as proven for (*) indium phosphide and gallium arsenide quantum dots, but is more typical in charge carriers. A layer of niobium covered by a copper film enclosing a toroidal ferromagnet was employed in its confirmation, which used electron holography to detect a shift which had been earlier predicted by Ehrenberg and Siday. Arising from the presence of a vector potential, FTP, what is this effect by which a series of propagating particles enclosing a restricted magnetic field experience a phase shift despite the lack of an external magnetic force?
