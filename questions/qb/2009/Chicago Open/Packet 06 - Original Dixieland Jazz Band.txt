answer: {Slater's} rules

A self-consistent field method to obtain the values predicted by these was developed by Clementi and Raimondi. These statements extended a system developed for by Clarence Zener for second period elements, and they ignored the radial nodes of the wavefunction since the nodes occur much closer to the nucleus compared to the hydrogen atom. The last one of these statements assigns a (*) modified value to the principle quantum number, and that quantity divides the main quantity calculated using these rules. They ignore electrons in outer shells compared to the electron being considered, and they group ns and np orbitals together. In addition, they assign certain d and f electrons a value of one due to their poor penetrating power. For 10 points, name these eponymous rules used to estimate the effective nuclear charge experienced by electrons.

answer: {Donald Barthelme}

The protagonist of one of this author's works concludes that “The war is temporary. But drawings and chocolate go on forever,” while another of this man's characters plays an instrument that works by pulling cats' tails and aspires to appear on the quiz show “Who Am I.” Novels by this man include a retelling set in 1940 of the life of King Arthur and a work featuring Bill and six other workers in a Chinese baby food factory who regularly have sex with the title character. An iniquitous critique by one philosopher of another's disparagement of the novel Lucinde is the subject of another work by this man, who spoofed Life Magazine profiles in (*) “Robert Kennedy Saved from Drowning.” That story, along with “The Balloon” and “The Indian Uprising,” was collected in Unspeakable Practices, Unnatural Acts. A proponent of “dialogue-arias,” this is, for 10 points, what author of Snow White whose other short story collections include City Life and Come Back, Dr. Caligari.

answer: {Sergeants}' {Revolt}

An attempt at mediation by Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles between the government of the nation in which this event took place and opposition groups like the labor union CNOC and the radical group ABC failed to slow the unrest that led to this event. A bus drivers' strike was an immediate catalyst of this event; that strike caused the communist URC to lose credibility when its collusion with the current president was made public, causing his exile and the installment of Alberto Herrera, the favorite of the US government. Over 1,000 porristas, members of the secret police, were executed in the streets after (*) Gerardo Machado was exiled, leading to Herrera's replacement by Manuel de Cespedes. Beginning at the bases of La Cabana and Camp Columbia, this uprising brought to power a man who would twenty years later lead another coup against Carlos Prio Socarras. For 10 points — brought on by Cespedes' policy of non-promotion of junior officers, name this 1933 rebellion led by Fulgencio Batista in Cuba.

answer: Henry {Cowell}

A chat between two Chinese people inspired this man's composition Amiable Conversation, and he also composed Concerto for Koto and Orchestra. His two-movement fifteenth symphony was nicknamed Thesis, and his eleventh of twenty symphonies begins by depicting a child's sleep, and was nicknamed Seven Rituals of Music. This man promoted music by his contemporaries in the periodical New Music, coined the term toccanta, and together with Leon Theremin, invented the rhythmicon. He wrote an opera based on the life of Bernardo O'Higgins, and he was inspired by William Walker's collection Southern Harmony to compose eighteen works for various instrumental combinations that are each entitled Hymn and Fuguing Tune. One work by this composer requires an assistant to depress the (*) damper pedal and begins with the performer using a finger, from low to high, to sweep the string of a piano. In another work that represents the sound of ocean waves this composer introduced secondal harmonies, which were created by striking the piano keys with the fist or forearm. For 10 points, name this pioneer of the "prepared piano" who composed The Aeolian Harp and made use of tone clusters in The Tides of Manaunaun.

answer: Battle of {Arausio}

The son of the man who lost this battle was lured into a trap by Quintus Poppaedius Silo fifteen years later, and this battle was a follow-up to one where a storm prevented the destruction of the forces of Gnaeus Papirius Carbo at Noreia. One of this battle's survivors was a young Quintus Sertorius, who managed to swim across the Rhone in full armor. Occuring because the proconsul refused to relinquish command to the newly arrived consul, the novus homo Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, this battle was followed up by victories at Sextiae and Vercellae. A defeat for Quintus Servilius (*) Caepio, this battle led directly to the second consular election of Gaius Marius and his following military reforms. For ten points, name this battle fought on October 6, 105 BCE, in which a Roman army of 80,000 was almost completely slaughtered by the Teutones and Cimbri.

In one of this man's stories the narrator pays the maid Filli 100 Francs to tell him whether the titular creature has alighted on a vase, while another consists entirely of speculation as to the species of the title bird. In addition to “The Sparrow-Hawk” and  Dinard's Butterfly, this author wrote that it “was never a question of my fleeing” in a “letter” addressed from Olivia to Malvolio. The title creature of another poem is described as an “arrow of love on earth” as it crosses the Alps to reach “these shores of ours.” That poem, “The Eel,” is part of a collection that also contains some poems about “Volpe,” The Storm. He calls his wife “the Fly” in a series of elegies upon her death, Xenia, while a more famous collection by this poet features a series of poems to “Clizia.” This man's best-known work features poems like “Chrysalis” and “The Wall” and a poem in which “even the poor know…the fragrance” of the titular “Lemon Trees.” For 10 points name this Hermeticist Italian poet of Occasions and Cuttlefish Bones.

answer: {Il Zuccone} [or Habbakuk before mentioned; or {Abbacchuco}; prompt on "{Pumpkinhead}"]

According to the Book of Antonio Billi, this work incorporates a portrait of Giovanni di Barduccio Cheruchini. The figure's mantle is clearly too large, in stark contrast to depictions of fabric folds in contemporary works like Nanni di Banco's Four Crowned Saints at Orsanmichele, and the drapery's loop on the left shoulder and lower folds sag forward, appearing to pull the figure into a slight bend from the waist. Current speculation that this work actually depicts Elisha arises partly from evidence regarding a depiction of that prophet on the doors of the facing baptistery and from the story in II Kings in which a (*) feature that prophet shares with this sculpture leads children to mock him, leading God to send a bear to devour them. Vasari is the source of the anecdote that its artist, while sculpting its dramatically open mouth, ordered it to "Speak, damn you! Speak!" Originally occupying a niche on the east campanile of the Florence Cathedral, FTP, name this sculpture supposedly representing the prophet Habbakuk better known for a nickname referring to its baldness.

The Rhesus Cytomegalovirus encodes for a protein which inhibits the translation of their heavy chains, and that protein is simply called "viral inhibitor of heavy chain expression." Beta-2 microglobulin associates with the heavy chains of these proteins. These proteins are the namesake of a loading complex that includes the thiol oxidoreductase chaperone Erp57, which is recruited to these proteins after BiP and calnexin aid in the folding of these proteins. In humans, the three main genes encoding for these are designated HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and TAP proteins aid in the processing of these proteins in the (*) ER. These proteins are not found on enucleated cells. The fragments loaded onto these are recognized by cells expressing the CD8 glycoprotein. They feature an important cleft, where objects from the cytosol, such as viral proteins can bind. For 10 points, name these glycoproteins that deliver foreign peptides to the cell surface.

Bohm-Bawerk offers that this concept's intensity is proportional to the "roundaboutness" of production process, and in the neo-classical growth model, investment is equal to the rate of depreciation times this value, plus the change in this value.  In endogenous growth models such as ones developed by Lucas and Romer, a particular version of this concept is included in the assessment of technological progress as knowledge accumulation. That same type of this concept is particularly affected by the "rest" problem, although no other types are. An eponymous controversy involved a debate between Cambridge professors Robinson and Sraffa and MIT professors Solow and Samuelson, and also involved the "aggregation problem" associated with this concept. Classically defined as one of the three factors of production along with land and labor, for 10 points, name this concept from economics, which also names a seminal multi-volume work by Karl Marx.

The eleventh man to hold this office had earlier been challenged to a duel by Jefferson Davis, a fact he used in his campaign to take this office in 1857, though the duel had been called off. The thirteenth man to serve in this position is given credit for recruitment efforts making his state the largest provider of soldiers to Union forces in the Civil War; his son of the same name assumed this position in 1901 for one term. In addition to William Bissell and the two (*) Richard Yates, another man to hold this office led the largest pro-silver contingent at the 1896 Democratic Convention, though he is more famous for his vigorous protests of Richard Olney's decision to use federal troops to crush a labor strike outside his biggest city. For 10 points -- John Peter Altgeld took a lenient stance toward participants in the Haymarket Square Riot while serving in this post, which has more recently been held by the scandal-plagued George Ryan and Rod Blagojevich.

Robert Lowell noted a voice that was like “the crackling of thorns under a pot” in a poem about this author's death by drowning. A crash course in German at the urging of Thomas Carlyle helped this writer produce the first English translation of Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe, and this author included the short poem “To a Friend” in a catalogue of a journey west which also includes one of the first calls for preservation of Native American societies, A (*) Summer on the Lakes. The story of Orpheus's failed attempt to rescue Eurydice is used to evoke a future time when women can save men in an essay that also decries the cliché that “every strong woman” is said to have “a masculine mind”; that essay, “The Great Lawsuit,” was included in her later book Woman in the Nineteenth Century.

Martin Hagglund has attempted to refute the idea of a truly linear connection between the thought of Jacques Derrida and this earlier thinker, suggesting that they only "share a vocabulary," in direct opposition to a 1990 work by Simon Critchley called The Ethics of Deconstruction, subtitled for Derrida and this man. The first original work he published after rendering the first French translation of Husserl's Cartesian Meditations was the essay "On Escape," in which he analyzed the connections between the intentional ego and what he called the "embodied self." While a prisoner of war in a camp near Hanover in WWII, he began work on (*) Existence and Existents, in which he developed his concept of the "face-to-face" as the basis for ethical behavior, an idea he developed from Talmudic study and furthered in his best-known work, in which he said that the primary demand made by all humans upon encounter is "thou shalt not kill me." Author of Otherwise Than Being, for ten points, name this Lithuanian-born French philosopher who wrote Totality and Infinity.

The founder of this period compiled texts like the nitchu gyoji and this period's namesake nenchu gyoji. A movement of this period that hoped to return to the Engi period in land reform was led by the author of the Jinno shotoki, Kitabatake Chikafusa. The downfall of this period was largely caused by the corrupt practices of the Onsho-gata, or Office of Awards, and at its beginning, the office of kampaku was abolished. It was brought about when militant Buddhist monks of the Kinai region allied with the forces of Kusunoki Masahige and Prince (*) Morinaga to allow this period's founder to return from exile on Oki. This period was followed by the Namboku-cho due to the establishment of a capital in Yoshino for a Southern Court.
