answer: Dmitry {Kabalevsky}

This man is the author of the musical treatise “Beautiful Things Evoke Goodness.” A piss-poor libretto led him to withdraw his opera Into the Fire, while he had more success with Encounter with a Miracle. This man composed a pair of fluff operettas, Spring Sings and Sisters, in addition to a notable set of 24 preludes for piano, which came in the wake of his unsuccessful wartime piece The Great Homeland. This composer was also known for children's songs like “The Band of Four Friends” and “Schooldays,” which he wrote while working on his first major work, “Poem of Struggle.” The composer of a piano version of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, he is better-known for operas based on Gorbatov's The Unvanquished and the life of Romain Rolland along with his third symphony, the “Requiem for Lenin.” For 10 points name this Russian composer of The Taras Family and Colas Breugnon.

answer: John {Ashbery}

This writer wrote an introduction for the English translation of noted Giorgio di Chirico novel Hebdomeros. One of this man's poems begins by noting that Oedipus "liked the glad personal quality of things beneath the sky," while he asks "OK, but which ones?" in a poem that urges people to live "the way that philosophers live." In addition to composing "Syringa" and "My Philosophy of Life," he wrote a poem in which "the saxophone wails, the martini was drained, and night like black swansdown settled on the city" and also asks "If we wanted to leave, would being naked help us?" Along with writing "Hotel Lautreamont," this man wrote a sestina which ends when Popeye scratches his balls and notes that "it sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country." That poem is "Farm Implements and Rutabagas in a Landscape," but this man's most famous poem has a turning point after "A balloon pops" and "the attention turns dully away" and ends "Here and there in cold pockets of remembrance, whispers out of time." For ten points, identify this New York poet who wrote a poem titled after something done "As Parmigianino did it," Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror.

answer: {Hill Sphere}

Artsakhov demonstrated a method of modeling chaotic stabilization of binary systems outside this construct via Aarseth-Zare regularization, and chaotic transitions toward this region from quasiperiodic trajectories along KAM tori may occur via intruder scattering. The Yarkovsky Effect, gas resonance, and tidal accretion are processes which have been invoked to explain permanent allochthonous body fixation (*) within it. The product of a semi-major axis, 1 minus eccentricity, and the cube root of one third the ratio of the lesser to the greater mass gives an approximation of its namesake radius, at which motion is Keplerian. It extends between the L1 and L2 Lagrange Points, below which third-body orbitals decay toward the Roche Limit. FTP, name this region in which the strength of a planet's gravitational field exceeds the strength of the solar gravitational field, in which stable lunar orbits may exist.

answer: {Lehmann} discontinuity [{NOTE}: the {earliest usage} of the {term} “{Lehmann} discontinuity” {referred} to the outer-inner core boundary, {though} this {definition has} been {discontinued}]

Local velocity perturbations of SS-precursors at this entity indicate that it displays a unique variable negative Clapeyron slope. Jordan's tectosphere hypothesis explains it as a petrologically distinct subcratonic chemical layer based on ScS reverberations observed at its depth. Aluminum substitution for iron, magnesium and silicon in garnets increases at this boundary, and harzburgite to garnet lherzolite and coesite to stishovite transitions have been proposed to account for its properties. However, it is the change in lattice preferred orientation of anisotropic olivine (*) that indicates the major mantle deformational shift that occurs here, namely the change from dislocation to diffusion creep. Detected mainly under continental lithosphere or island arcs, it is usually absent in the presence of a well-defined Gutenberg discontinuity. FTP, name this 210-km deep seismic reflector layer in the upper mantle that shares its name with an early moniker for the outer-inner core boundary, named for a female seismologist.

answer: {aziridines} [accept {ethenylamine} until mentioned; prompt on "{aza variants} of {epoxides}" until mentioned; {grudgingly} accept {aza}-{ethylene}]

An exciting reaction developed by Ishikawa sees aldehydes transformed into these molecules via a guanidium ylide mediated step, and Taguchi developed an "intramolecular trapping" variant of a reaction wherein  these functional groups are formed by treating ketoximes with excess Grignard reagents. Experiments by Laurent et al demonstrated the mechanism of that reaction, which is named for Hoch and Campbell reaction. Quizbowlers may appreciate the fact that taurine can be synthesized by the reaction of the simplest of these compounds with sulphurous acid, and other methods of preparing them include the reaction of carbenes with imines. These molecules can also be prepared by the ring closure of 1,2-amino alcohols in the presenc of sulphuric acide via the Wenker synthesis, and the high ring strain in these compounds makes them useful for synthetic reactions because they easily undergo ring opening by nucleophilic attack. Sometimes called the aza-variats of epoxides, for 10 points, identify these functional groups which are three-membered heterocyclic rings wherein two carbon atoms are bound to a nitrogen atom, which are sometimes known as ethenyl-imines.

In The Iliad, one King from this polity goes into a frenzy and kills Itymoneus and Agelaos after Paris errantly shoots Euenor, and* Nestor nostalgically recalls a war with this polity over grazing rights. A legendary set of twins from this polity were supposedly born conjoined from a silver egg after Poseidon seduced their mother, Queen Molione of Boupraison. The port city of Kyllene in this polity lay across from the island of Doulikhion, whose most famous King was Meges, while the throne of another of this polity's cities was seized after Myrtilos sabotaged the chariot of King Oinomaos. Foreknowledge of his death led the legendary founder of this polity to hold a chariot race among his sons for the throne, and this polity's royal line traces its roots back through Aethlios to Deucalion. Herakles twice invaded this Kingdom after being offended after his fifth labor by its King, Augeius, and after winning he established an altar to a legendary King of one of this polity's other cities, Pelops. Also containing Pisa, this is, for ten points, what ancient Kingdom allegedly founded by Endymion?

answer: {qualia}

Gary Drescher wrote an article relating these things to gensyms in LISP, while J.B. Maund wrote about ways to "dual code" these by describing them on more than one level. Ramachandran and Hirstein developed three laws of them, later adding a fourth, including the importance of their relation to attention. In an article titled after the "epiphenomenal" type of these things, Frank Jackson offered a knowledge argument of them that ends by refuting physicalism entirely. Daniel Dennett wrote an article about "Quining" these things, which claims that they fail in practical application. These concepts were most notably discussed in a paper which claimed that there was a quality to all experiences missing in reductive science, Thomas Nagle's What is it Like to Be a Bat?, and philosophical zombies are identical to humans except that they lack these. For ten points, identify these concepts from the philosophy of mind which refer to the subjective qualities that characterize conscious experiences, from the Latin word for "what kind?"

answer: {Type}-{II Superconductivity} [prompt on: {Superconductivity} or word forms {thereof}]

One critical feature occasionally exhibited in this property is modeled by the Lifschitz-Kosevich formula, which gives similar results to the Zilberman model. Evolution of this phenomenon is described by a multi-valued current-voltage equation known as the Bean critical state model. Field strengths involved in the upper limit of its occurrence may be calculated using the (*) Eilenberger equations. In addition to the occurrence of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations within Abrikosov Vortex Lattices, it may be identified by the presence of flux pinning, as well as the occurrence of striping, which encourages hole-pairing in a manner similar to BCS theory. It was first confirmed in yttrium barium cuprate, which exhibited a mixed version of the Meissner Effect. FTP, name this property of materials, many of which exhibit perovskite structure, characterized by complete expulsion of magnetic fields at elevated temperatures.
