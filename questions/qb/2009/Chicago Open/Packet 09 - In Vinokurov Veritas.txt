answer: {Stéphane Mallarmé}

This poet wrote about the lute that “under the dreamer's golden canopy” could “from its belly alone / give birth to you like a son” in the poem “A Lace Curtain Self-Destructs.” One of this poet's speakers argues for the superiority of imagination to reality by noting, “My hunger, feasting on no present fruits / finds in their learned lack an equal zest” in a poem opening “My old books closed once more on Paphos' name,” while his poem “Sea-Breeze” notably begins, “The flesh is sad, alas! And I have read all the books.” The speaker of another poem asserts, “The Poet revives with a naked sword his age…even as Eternity brings him at last to Himself” while looking at a monument to that poet. This poet wrote the unfinished prose poem (*) Dice Thrown Never Will Annul Chance and the aforementioned “The Tomb of Edgar Poe,” but his best known poem ends with the speaker lamenting, “Adieu, you two. I shall see the shade you are” after letting two nymphs he hoped to ravish escape. For 10 points, name this French poet of “The Afternoon of the Faun.”

answer: {Orphism}

One adherent of this artistic movement illustrated Blaise Cendrars' poem "The Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France.” It was adopted much later for a time by Romanian composer Iancu Dumitrescu, and the principles of this movement were applied to textiles and pottery by Sofia Terk. Musicologist Gabrielle Buffet was a brief participant in this movement, as were the Synchromists Patrick Bruce and Arthur Frost. This group's theories were expounded in the short-lived magazine Montjoie!, and its manifesto was translated for the magazine Der Sturm by Paul Klee. Characteristic works in the style of this movement include a series of “Fugal” pictures by Frantisek Kupka and two paintings of an American girl named Udnie by Francis (*) Picabia. This movement's most prominent figure created a notable series of paintings of the Eiffel tower, but most of his works in this style consist of numerous circles of color. Originally named by Guillaume Apollinaire, this is, for 10 points, what offshoot of cubism founded by Robert Delaunay and named for a mythical Greek musician?

answer: {Pigeonhole} Principle [or {Dirichlet's} Box Principle]

This result names a complexity class whose central problem asks whether a function that takes n-bit strings to each other can return a string of all zeros or two inputs map to the same output, while Rhodes showed that this result has Chvatal Rank O(Log n). Thue used this result in order to prove the existence of auxiliary function as part of his proof of Siegel's lemma, (*) while applying it to the first 2N positive integers is used to prove Proizvolov's identity. This result can be used to show that for an irrational number q, the fractional parts generated by multiplying it by the set of integers are dense in [0, 1]. It can also be used to show that collisions in a hash table are inevitable, that two people in a party of n have the same number of friends present, and that at least two of any group of 3 people shares a gender. For 10 points, name this combinatorial principle that states if n+1 objects are placed in n boxes, one box has to have two items.

answer: {Boston Police} Strike

The Storrow Committee was an unsuccessful attempt to avoid this event, which Francis Russell wrote about in A City in Terror. One official called this event "a crime against civilization," and it was partly inspired by the ineffectiveness of a Social Club which Frank McCarthy attempted to reform. This event led to a group of sailors stoning bystanders and smashing windows and a brief takeover by gangs, and it failed due to lack of support by the (*) Central Labor Union. Andrew J Peters called in a militia to handle this event, which eventually lead to the hiring of some one thousand veterans. This event occurred after Edwin Upton Curtis refused to adjust wages for inflation and recognize a union chartered by the AFL, and it notably propelled the governor to the vice presidential ticket under Warren G Harding. For 10 points, name this September 1919 event handled by Governor Calvin Coolidge, a strike involving law enforcement agents in an East Coast city.

answer: {Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase} [accept {TERT} or {hTERT} until mention]

Along with semaphorin F and delta-catenin, this protein is deleted in Cri-du-chat syndrome, and this molecule is targeted by Geron's GRN163 compound. The ELISA-based TRAPEZE assay is used to detect the activity of this protein, which can also be done using the TRAP assay. POT1 and TPP1 prime this enzyme's attachment after detaching from the (*) shelterin complex, and the DSB-associated MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex is required for the ALT pathway, whose action is parallel to the action of this enzyme. Factors that bind to G-quadruplexes also inhibit this protein, and this protein was originally discovered in cell-free extracts of Tetrahymena by Greider and Blackburn. Like a related protein, this protein contains a Finger, Palm, and Thumb domain, and its aberrant activation leads to abrogation of the Hayflick limit. Consisting of the TERT protein and a built-in RNA template, for 10 points, name this protein that is responsible for lengthening the ends of chromosomes.

answer: {Transcendental Etudes} [prompt on "{etudes}"]

The third one of these works beginning with a “sempre legato e placido” section was inspired by watching the changing scenery during a train ride, while the ninth one is inspired by the composer's transcriptions of cantabile Italian opera. Along with pieces titled “Paysage” and “Ricordanza,” the two untitled members of this set of works were given nicknames by Ferrucio Busoni when he called the second one “Rockets” and the tenth one “Appassionata” though those pieces are better known by their tempo markings, “molto vivace” and “allegro agitato molto” respectively. In one of these works the main theme is presented as a series of octaves played against a flurry of thirds and that theme reappears in the “Animato” section representing the fading strength of a (*) horse's gallop while carrying a figure who is crowned king at the end of this section inspired by a Victor Hugo poem. In addition to the final one called "Chasse-Neige, the fifth one of these works is titled “Feux Follets” or “Will o' Wisp” while the fourth one is called “Mazeppa.” For 10 points name this 1852 set of twelve pieces for solo piano written by Franz Liszt.

answer: {error correction} [accept {logical} equivalents]

A method of accomplishing this using the BCH technique relies on the Bose distance and involves a defining set constructed from the union of cyclotomic cosets. Computing the syndromes and solving the locator polynomial are two steps in the Peterson-Gorenstein-Zierler algorithm for performing this action. The information necessary to do this action can be generated using such techniques as the Golay code or the Reed-Solomon code, and the (*) Viterbi algorithm is also used to do this. The theorem that shows that this action can be performed to arbitrary accuracy determines if this action needs to be performed including cyclic redundancy checks as well verifying against a checksum. Accomplished by such methods as Hamming codes, which are commonly used to perform single instances of this operation, for 10 points, identify this action in which a message that has been corrupted on transmission is recovered by the receiver.
