answer: transcription

Many proteins that control the rate of this process contain zinc finger domains. In some organisms, a structure named for Pribnow is the site of this process, which in prokaryotes begins when a holoenzyme forms from the binding of a sigma factor. In eukaryotes, its initiation is greatly aided by the acetylation of histones and often occurs at the TATA box. This process is followed by a step in which lariats form and introns are spliced out after polymerase has bound to and run along the template strand. For 10 points, identify this process through which a DNA template is turned into messenger RNA.
