answer: quicksort

A multikey version of this algorithm employs a three-way radix, and the introsort variant switches to heapsort when a bad case is encountered. In-place implementations of this algorithm requires only O (log n) [big oh of log n] space. Its quadratic worst case, which occurs when a single element is partitioned in each step, is much worse than a similar algorithm whose namesake operation joins two sorted sublists, mergesort, though both perform an average case of O (n log n) [big oh of n log n] comparisons. This algorithm's essential step picks a pivot element and places only smaller elements to the left of it. For 10 points, name this divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm developed by C. A. R. Hoare.

Rotenone can block one part of this pathway, and superoxides can erroneously form in its first and third sites. Iron-sulfur clusters act as carriers in it for the protonated form of Flavin mononucleotides, which are transferred to another protein to form semiquinone. In it, succinate is converted to fumarate prior to the formation of cytochrome c, which an eponymous oxidase alters to enable the formation of two water molecules. It ultimately involves the movement of four protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondria, thereby creating a proton gradient capable of powering the synthesis of ATP. For 10 points, name this series of complexes responsible for oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes, often abbreviated ETC.
