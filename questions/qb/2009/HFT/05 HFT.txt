answer: {van der Waals} equation

One of its principle failings comes at gas-liquid equilibria, since it does not predict that at constant temperature, pressure is constant as volume varies; however, it is still better under those conditions than a generally-superior modification, the Redlich-Kwong equation, does even worse with vapor-liquid equilibria. Its two parameters account for particle size and nonzero interparticle interaction strength and are typically written as a and b. It shares a namesake with the forces arising from particles developing instantaneous dipoles. For 10 points, identify this equation of state, an improvement on and generalization of the ideal gas law.
