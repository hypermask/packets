answer: {Gibbs free energy} [or Gibbs energy; or Gibbs function]

One form of this quantity can be derived to be discontinuous when mixing two dissimiliar liquids, known as its namesake's paradox. The derivative of volume with respect to temperature at constant pressure is equal to the pressure partial of the temperature partial of this quantity by a Maxwell relation, and it can be defined as the sum over the product of chemical potental and particle number.
