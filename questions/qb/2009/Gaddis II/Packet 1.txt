answer: {Slutsky} Equation

[AR] Cholesky factorization has been applied in order to impose curvature conditions on this equation's associated matrix. Oliver de La Grandville's paper on the geometrical construction of this equation utilizes Shephard's lemma in order to put this equation in derivative form. This equation's namesake also names an effect associated with the changes in trend lines due to random outliers where moving average techniques have been applied, along with Yule. A solution to this equation can be constructed without knowing the relevant indifference curves, if we know the elasticity of substitution at the initial equilibrium point.  The use of Cobb-Douglas preferences can be used to compute the Ordinary Demand associated with this equation and its associated matrix is symmetric and negative semi-definite. This equation's construction as a parallelogram is referred to as its eponymous ? diamond. Accounting for substitution and income effects, for 10 points, name this equation of microeconomics which relates changes in Marshellian demand to Hicksian demand developed by its Ukrainian namesake.

[AR] This practice was instituted by Frederick II on certain members of the colony of Lucera in Apulia during the 13th century. A Mutazili author offers that during the performance of this, one ought to be grabbed by the scruff of the neck and then slapped. Paul Heck suggests that its institution in Baghdad derives from a similar practice engaged in by the Sassasian empire. Its abolishment is supposed to coincide with the arrival of the Second Coming of Jesus.  Ibn Rushd claims this practice is more general and is related to the practice of 'ushr, and can apply during times of war or engaging in trade during the Dar al-Harb. Differing interpretations of this practice question whether it represents a "substitute" or?"tribute" and this practice is only mentioned by name once in the Quran. Two of the main rationalizations for its institution fall along Communalist and Universalist lines and are associated with dhimma, or religious freedom, and the related institution of zakat. For 10 points, name this tax abolished by Akbar and re-instituted by Aurangzeb levied on non-Muslims.

[CC] This phenomenon was originally called "01T-ALPHA" and "50L-NONAME" and was also known by some experts as "Aldonça" for a time before being given its more commonly known name. Its relatively low ceiling height has caused some debate about its classification and it formed similarly to a related phenomenon off Australia's East Coast. It made an unusual loop before it doubled-back for its final approach to land where it caused more than $25 million in damage largely because the Epagri/Ciram agency had never seen such a phenomenon before.

answer: pre mRNA {splicing} [accept {clear knowledge} equivalents]

[GK] One protein which regulates this process in humans is sequestered by Poly CTG repeats in the DMPK gene, which is one of the causes of myotonic dystrophy. This process requires the formation of a commitment complex which involves the recognition of a polypyrimidine track, and this process does not occur at regions with bound SR proteins. One protein involved in it binds to that polypyrimidine track and aids in the binding of BBP. Another protein involved in this process recognizes a UACUAC [Wack-wack] element and leaves an extrahelical A residue, which is used in the formation of a ? lariat. The catalytic steps of this process are performed by a core of U2, U5, and U6 proteins, and those protein-RNA complexes are called snRNPs [snurps.] For 10 points, identify this process wherein introns are removed from preliminary mRNA, and which can give rise to several isoforms of a protein.

[JM] This book's second section compares the joy of possessing the truth while others search in vain to standing on shore watching a shipwreck or watching a battle from a safe place. Its third section argues that a living being's vital spirit dissipates into space after death rather than being immortal. Sadly, the existence of furries refutes its fourth section's assertion that "the one stimulus that evokes seed from the human body is the human form." This book refutes the idea that types of matter are made up of particles of that substance by likening particles to letters that combine to form different words. Its sixth and final section attempts to debunk superstition by discussing natural phenomena like earthquakes, volcanoes, and epidemics, such as the 430 BCE plague that befell Athens. This poem asserts that the world is composed of an infinite number of constantly falling ? atoms, which cause free will because of their clinamen, or swerve. Addressed to Gaius Memmius, for 10 points, name this poem that describes the world through the philosophy of Epicurus, written by Lucretius.

[JM] This artist wrote many poems based on his works, including the lines "In the morning, ashen-hued, came nymphs dancing through the wood" to accompany his painting Dancing Dryads. Poe's poem "The Haunted Palace" inspired his painting of three graces standing next to a fountain, The Temple of the Mind. His paintings of men on horseback meeting women in a forest include King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid and Roadside Meeting, and he was the sole American painter to be grouped with European masters like Cezanne, van Gogh, and Matisse in the Armory Show. Because this artist often applied new layers of paint before the old layers dried, his paintings are today suffused with wrinkles and cracks. His obsession with the sea resulted in his many paintings of moonlight marines, including Siegfried and the Rhine Maidens, Lord Ullin's Daughter, and Toilers of the Sea. He referred to one of his paintings as "the Reverse," alluding to the backwards direction of the central figure--that painting features a snake slithering behind a shadowy fence, and is sometimes called The ? Race Track.

In photonics, cascading can give rise to the quadratic variety of these objects, which in the limit of a small harmonic component reduce to the Kerr variety. The Zakharov equations can be solved to obtain their Langmuir type, while switching the sign of the interaction term in the same equations yield the "whistler" type. Backlund transforms can be used to show that collision between two of these only results in a phase shift, and kink and anti-kink forms of these are solutions to the ?sine-Gordon equation, which can also be used to model their collisions. A mathematical basis for them was discovered by Kruskal and Zabusky, and they arise in the solution of the Fermi-Passta-Ulam problem.
