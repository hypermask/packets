answer: {Plan 17}

[MB] It was criticized in a work by Jean Jaures which prophesized a large increase in the size of armies, and a primary target of it was the Metz-Thionville fortresses.  Its predecessor placed a much heavier emphasis on the region from Hirson to the sea, while it notably underestimated the role of reserves.  It was unsuccessfully executed at the Battle of Charleroi when General Lanrezac retreated to avoid total annihilation of his troops.  Formulated by Ferdinand Foch, it was implemented in the unsuccessful Battle of the Frontiers into ? Alsace and Lorraine.  Despite evidence to the contrary, it notably asserted that the threat of British intervention would prohibit attacks through Belgium.  For 10 points, name this French strategy for countering German aggression in the Schlieffen Plan prior to World War I, named for a certain number.

In another work, he argued that systemic violence was meant to prevent the formation of what he called a "cold monster," and he noted that "segmentation was the effect of war," not the other way around, in his work The Archaeology of Violence. This man collaborated with Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari on their work Anti-Oedipus. In this man's most famous work, he used the example of the Guayaki tribe to argue against both the concept of a "noble savage" and the notion that human society tends naturally toward a government. For 20 points, identify this anthropologist who argued for the necessity of anarchy in his work Society Against the State.

answer: {Muller's Ratchet} [accept {Fisher}-{Muller Mechanism}]

[AR] Numerical investigations of this process following Haigh's suggestion assumes the optimal class is an isolated population, and Mukai's observations of viability modifiers on the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster can provides estimates for its efficiency. Its effectiveness is dependent on the number of individuals N and thus this model's rate is equal to N times e to the quantity negative U divided by s, where s is the selection coefficient and U is the Poisson mean number. In small populations this process is dominated by the establishment phase and is similar to the "error-catastrophe" theory of somatic aging suggested by Orgel. It has been shown that this model is mathematically equivalent to the Hill-Robertson effect and the current name for this eponymous mechanism is attributed to a 1974 paper by Felsenstein, "The Evolutionary Advantage of Recombination." Its namesake won the 1946 Nobel for his discovery that X-Rays increase the rate of mutation. Proposing to explain the comparative advantage of ?sexual reproduction and co-developed by R.A. Fisher, for 10 points, name this model that describes how genomes of asexual populations irreversibly accumulate deleterious mutations and for which its efficiency is described in number of "turns."

[CC] The first image of this phenomena was captured by Robert Franz and John Winckler in the midst of videotaping a rocket launch. These phenomena can sometimes be classified by shape into forms named "carrots" and "jellyfish" and large clusters can be called "fireworks." Recent high-speed video proved that their so-called "tendrils" are actually extremely fast-moving balls although they are theorized to only release one to ten megajoules of energy. They are studied at the Yucca Ridge observatory and researchers from the University of Alaska determined that this phenomena is red. Appearing at altitudes of 45 to 95 kilometeres and often more than fifty kilometres in height, they often occur in clusters and used to be known as ? "cloud-to-ionosphere-discharges." For 10 points, identify this kind of upper-atmosphere lighting that appears briefly above thunderstorms and should not to be mistaken for pixies, gnomes, or elves.

[JM] This work criticizes a proposal to write an article about its author in the Mercure de France by quoting the lines "I think they love not Art / Who break the crystal of a poet's heart / That small and sickly eyes may glare and gloat." It regrets that the story of Christ was "interrupted and spoiled by the dreary classical Renaissance" of "Petrarch, and Raphael's frescoes, and Palladian architecture," since they were "made from without and by dead rules," and repeats that "The supreme vice is shallowness. Whatever is realised is right." Its author attacks a former friend for using the name "Prince Fleur de Lys" to "seek entrance to the House of Pain," and bitterly asserts that he now sits in Malebolge between Gilles de Retz and the Marquise de Sade. This work compares Robbie Ross lifting his hat as its author was taken to Bankruptcy Court to a saint kissing a leper, and accuses its addressee of having a "terrible lack of imagination," which brought its author to financial ruin and prevented him from completing the dramas La Sainte Courtesane and the Florentine Tragedy. Its author calls sorrow "the type and test of all great art," and cites its presence in his short stories "The Young King" and "The ? Happy Prince." Beginning "In Carcere Et Vinculis," and addressed to "Bosie," for 10 points, name this letter written to Lord Alfred Douglas from Reading Prison by Oscar Wilde.

[GK] The McQuarrie-Katz and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen variants involve application of perturbation theory to this model, which require the separation of its terms. Along with Devonshire, it's namesake introduced a theory to describe the melting of simple solids. The 'shifted force' form of this model includes an extra linear term which ensures that its gradient is zero at the cutoff length, which is usually set around 2.5, and for binary systems the interaction parameters can be calculated by applying the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules to the parameters of this model. Applying this model to spherical molecules with point dipole moments gave rise to the Stockmayer model,  and one of its terms describes repulsion between electron ? clouds as a result of the Pauli exclusion principle. The 1 over r to the sixth term in this describes attraction due to van der Waals forces and it. For 10 points, identify this model that describes interactions between two atoms, which isn't actually doubly eponymous.

[JM] According to musicologist Johanna Spector, the melody for this prayer derives from the ninth century cantillation of the beginning of Genesis. An 1844 theological conference in Brunswick unanimously ruled that this prayer was superfluous and should be removed from the liturgy. Meïr of Rothenburg developed the custom of reciting "Bi-yeshibah shel ma'alah" before this prayer, which Rabbenu Tam attempted to change into the imperfect tense. Meïr ben Samuel changed the language of this prayer to mention the upcoming year instead of the past one. For centuries, the language of this prayer was used to justify the repressive Oath More Judaico. The Opus 47 of Max Bruch contains variations on the melody of this prayer, which is recited three times by the chazzan. Anti-Semites commonly cite this prayer to argue that Jews are duplicitous and untrustworthy, and it contains the line "May they be deemed ? absolved, forgiven, annulled, and void, and made of no effect; they shall not bind us nor have power over us." For 10 points, name this prayer whose title is Aramaic for "All Vows," recited to begin the evening service on Yom Kippur.

[AR] One character in this work who cares for the nearer future only because it is nearer, a trait that the author claims is quite common, is named Proximus, and his defeat does not necessitate a victory for S. In one chapter of this work the author describes entering  the Teletransporter, only to have his mind destroyed by the Scanner, but because a Blueprint of himself is sent to Mars to be replicated, the author shows that this "Branch-Line" case is not akin to death. The author of this work suggests that if future pains behaved like Alice's "Jam Tomorrow"from Wonderland, then they would not matter at all.  In a critique of this work by Schrader-Frechette's, she equivocates on the author's understanding of "imperceptible difference" and likens an example of the wounded soldiers in the desert needing water to the Sorties problem. That critique deals with the claims in a chapter entitled "Five Mistakes of Moral Mathematics." This work shows that while the addition of one more private car does not add noticeably to traffic, on the aggregate level congestion would demand that the use of  less convenient buses would be in one's self-interest, therefore on a collective level ? egoism is self-defeating in the Dilemma of the Commuter.
