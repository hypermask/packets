answer: {Clausius}-{Mosotti} equation [accept early ({Clausius}-{Mosotti})-{Lorenz}-{Lorentz equation}]

The Maxwell Garnet equation can be derived either from Rayleigh scattering or from this equation, and in liquid crystals, the Maier-Meier equations are roughly analogous to this equation.  Buckingham and Pople approximated the right side of this equation as an infinite series by multiplying the left side by the molar volume, and the Kirkwood correction is used for certain non-ideal substances.  Debye modified this equation to account for temperature dependence and the presence of permanent dipoles.  The left side of this equation is the ratio of a certain constant ?minus one and that constant plus two.  This equation is equivalent to the Lorenz-Lorentz equation when the index of refraction is used.  For 10 points, name this doubly-eponymous relation between a molecule's polarizability and its dielectric constant.

answer: {Inert pair} effect (accept {Lone pair effect})

[EM] This effect was first described by the same scientist who outlined the importance of dative bonds in coordination complexes, Nevil Sidgwick. A thermodynamic explanation of this effect relies on low values of metal-ligand bond enthalpies and was outlined by Drago, but it is believed that this effect arises from the relativistic contraction in the Bohr atomic model. This effect is used to explain why PbO is more stable than PbO2, why the +1 oxidation state of titanium is so common, and also explains why group 14 elements tend to form compounds in a +2 oxidation state. Occurring due to electrons pulling closer to heavier nuclei, for 10 points, name this effect in which heavier members of the p-block tend to have an oxidation number ? two less than their valency, due to a namesake group of two electrons not participating in bonding.

answer: {Fisher}-{Yates Shuffle} [or {Knuth Shuffle}]

[MB] A parallel implementation of this algorithm by Gustedt et al notes that the implementation of it by Moses and Oakford and Durstenfeld causes many cache misses due to accessing memory unpredictably, a parallel algorithm that makes heavy use of recursive sampling of a communication matrix.  One variant of this algorithm operates on the range 1 to n - i rather than 1 to n - i + 1 at each step and allows for cyclic varieties of its output.  Besides being related to Sattolo's Algorithm, its optimized running time of Big O of n is achieved through making use of the back of the array, and it operates by iteratively finding a random number k in the range 1 to n and then swapping the elements at the k and n positions.  For 10 points, name this algorithm for randomly ? permuting the elements of a set, sometimes named for the computer scientist who created the MMIX computer architecture and who popularized the algorithm in his The Art of Computer Programming.
