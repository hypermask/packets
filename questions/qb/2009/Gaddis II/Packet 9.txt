answer: {Toll receptor/signalling/whatever} [accept {TLR} or {Toll} Like {Receptor} from {confused people}]

[GK] The I kappa B homolog Cactus is degraded downstream of it, causing the release of a dif/relish dimer. Its intracellular domain interacts with activator protein Myd88, and the receptor domain of interleukin-1 has a high degree of homology with its cytoplasmic amino acid sequence in mammals. The spatzle ligand binds to it in drosophila, causing the upregulation of drosomycin, and it was identified due to its role in dorso-ventral pattern regulation in drosophila. The family of receptors homologous to it recognize lipo-poly-saccharides and peptidoglycan, and are thus involved in  recognition of ?conserved molecular patterns in pathogens. For 10 points, identify this protein involved in a signalling pathway which is activated by gram positive bacteria and fungi, and derives its name from a German expression for "cool".

answer: {Magnificat} [The work it's {paired} with is The {Easter Oratorio}, {so take} that until "{outright practical joke}"]

[SJ] Paul McCreesh's 2001 recording of this work alongside the Gabrieli Consort uses one voice per part. Donald Tovey chided editors for adding continuo parts to an "outright practical joke" in one aria in this work, which sees the flutes stop in the middle of playing to represent the wealthy being refused succor, and an obbligato for oboe d'amore features in the aria "Quia respexit." Tovey also contends that the modern practice of singing the phrase "omnes generationes" faster than adagio is groundless. Kowalski noted the "lengthy melismas for each voice" in an aria which sees the proud scattered,  "Fecit potentiam." The singers claim that God fills the hungry in "Esurientes implevit boni" and this work also features the bass aria "Quia fecit mihi magna." Its composer removed the Christmas related text from the original version of this work in E flat major, and after it was transposed to D major, it was premiered for the Feast of Visitation at St. Thomas's Church in 1733.  It was composed in the same year as the Kyrie and Gloria from its composer's ? Mass in B Minor, his other major choral work in Latin. For 10 points, name this canticle for the Virgin Mary, a work of Johann Sebastian Bach.

answer: {Swabian War} of 1499 [or {Schwabenkrieg}; prompt on "{Swiss War}" or "{Schweizerkrieg}"]

[MB/JM] The Grey League, League of the Ten Jurisdictions and League of God's House combined form the Three Leagues and fight for the victors in this conflict, presumably helping win the Battle of Frastan.  The victors in this conflict, which amusingly saw initial fighting at the Battle of Hard, were aided by the Rhaetian League.  Its pivotal battle, the last fought in a certain country until the 1700s, again saw the dominance of pike squares, as in an earlier conflict's battles of Grandson and Morat; that engagement was known as the Battle of Dornach.  The settlement ending this conflict saw one polity add Schaffhausen to its territories and was known as the Peace of Basel.  Coming some 20 years after the Burgundian Wars, it was sparked by the increased economic control mandated in the Diet of Worms by Emperor Maximilian I.  For 10 points, identify this conflict that saw the ? Swiss Confederation gain increased autonomy after beating an eponymous league named for a region of Southwestern Germany.

answer: {Haskalah} [accept {Jewish Enlightenment} until mentioned]

[AR] Some of the influences on this movement include Leibnitz's doctrine of harmony and Christian Wolff's work in establishing the similarity of reason and revelation. One person was briefly a member of this movement before choosing Kant to become a respondent for his dissertation, Meditations Drawn from Speculative Wisdom. Along with Marcus Herz, one Galician member of this movement attempted to reconcile a belief of a personal God with the abstract metaphysics of Hegel and Schelling. Yet another member of this group, in a critique of Kant, defended the demonstrability of the existence of God in Morning Hours. The adherents of this movement were known as ?maskilim, and its foremost Prussian advocate wrote such works as the Letters on Feeling and wrote the Platonic dialogue Phaedo, or on the Immortality of the Soul. With such members as Nachman Krochmal and Salomon Maimon, for 10 points, name this movement whose most important exponent was Moses Mendelssohn, also known as the Jewish Enlightenment.

[EM] This god's daughter-in-law turned into a dragon after giving birth to his grandchildren. This god's sons were a fisherman and a hunter, and once exchanged their instruments, leading to one of them marrying a sea princess after losing a fishhook. Those children, Hoori and Hoderi, were born after this figure's wife trapped herself in a burning hut to prove her loyalty. His attendants included Koyane and Futodama, who gave birth to a line of priests, and this god rejected Ihanaga the rock deity as a wife, instead selecting the goddess of flowers Ko-no-hana, leading to humanity having short lifespans. He was accompanied by 8 million deities during his quest, and during his 300,000 year reign supposedly spent time arranging happy marriages for his subordinates. His sister descended to earth topless ? in order to distract Sarutahiko, and who also danced in order to get a another deity to come out of her cave, Uzume.

answer: {Green}-{Tao} theorem

[EM] Chen and Shi used this theorem to prove Goldring's conjecture, and the namesakes of this theorem used to to prove a case of the “Mobius and nilsequences conjecture”. The proof of this theorem relies on a generalization of the Koopman-von Neumann structure theorem and the Goldston-Yildirim truncated divisor sum. It was extended by one of its namesakes and Ziegler to polynomial progressions, and its namesakes proved a transference principle in order to obtain this result. Its namesakes relied on extending the statement that every subset of the integers 1 through N contains an arithmetic progression of length k, known as Szemerdi's theorem, and this theorem is similar to Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. For 20 points, name this theorem that states that there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes with arbitrary common difference, named for a British and Australian-Chinese mathematician.

answer: {Democratic Peace} Theory [{Also} accept "{Liberal Peace Theory}" or "The {Democratic Peace}"]

[TM] A 2005 paper by Gartzke argued that financial dependence explainedm this phenomenon. Game theory accounts for this by arguing that a certain system increases the efficiency of the passage of infomration, while Immanuel Wallerstein wrote a paper replacing this theory's premises with global capitalism. One criticism of this theory cites the prevalence of US backed coups and seeks to replace its conclusions by noting the extreme polarization of the Cold War era . One extension of this concept focuses on the role multi-national corporations take in stablitiy and is Thomas Friedman's Golden Arches paradigm, while the Kargil War is sometimes cited as an exception to it. ? For 10 points, identify this theory inititally proposed by Kant in his essay about a "Perpetual" type of this, which takes as its evidence that countries with free elections have not yet attacked other countries with free elections.

answer: {You Know Me Al}

[JM] Virginia Woolf's essay "American Fiction" calls this book "the best prose that has come our way." Its protagonist fears sailing across the Pacific Ocean because he worries that the only chance he has to eat if his boat sinks is to wash up on the Sandwich Islands. However, the protagonist is finally persuaded to take that trip when two men read him a fake letter from Woodrow Wilson warning him that his refusal will spark war between the United States and Japan. After learning that his former girlfriend Hazel has married Kid Levy, the protagonist marries Allen's sister Florrie. Its sequels include The Real Dope and Treat 'em Rough, and this book's six sections include "The Busher's Kid" and "The Busher Comes Back." Kid Gleason often punches this book's main character, who loses a game by intentionally hitting Joe Hill in the head with the bases loaded, and is consistently duped into signing cheap contracts by Charles Comiskey. Consisting of letters written to the title character by fictional White Sox pitcher ? Jack Keefe, for 10 points, name this comedic masterpiece by Ring Lardner.

answer: {Karl} Friedrich {Schinkel}

[SJ] This man never enacted his plans to erect the Orianda palace and he called for the reconstruction of the Athena Promachos in his plan to make the Acropolis into a royal palace. He combined dark glazed brick with the unglazed variety to develop a striped pattern and tawny color that characterizes buildings such as his Feilner House and he designed the setting of the Hall of the Stars for The Magic Flute. He had his student Ludwig Persius supervise construction of the Romische Bader which lies next to this man's Italiante Hofgartnerei as well as his Charlottenoff. This student of Friedrich and David Gilly was constrained by C.G Langhans' earlier theater for his construction of the Schauspielhaus, while another work by this man had to be floated over a subterranean peat bog and had to conform to the other buildings on the Lustgarten. Besides the Altes museum, a large exhibition of his work can be found in his Neo-Gothic Friedrichswerdersche Church, and he created a work found near the Stadtschloss in Berlin which features red brick. For 20 points,  name this creator of the Bauakademie, a neoclassical German architect.

answer: The {Changeling}

[JM] The main plot of this play is based on the fourth story of John Reynolds's The Triumphs of God's Revenge against Murder, and its title role established the careers of William Robbins and Timothy Reade. In its final scene, the female lead compares herself to bad blood which deserves to be cast into "the common sewer." In its fourth act, that character discovers an improbable virginity test contained in "Glass M," causing her to perform the bed trick with her servant Diaphanta. In its subplot, Isabella proves faithful to her jealous husband Alibius, who operates a madhouse run by Lollio. The authors of this play also collaborated on A Fair Quarrel and The World Tossed at Tennis. In the third act of this play, a deformed servant murders the brother of Tomazo and cuts off the dead man's finger after being unable to pull off a diamond ring—that servant then shows the finger to the female lead, who becomes free to marry Alsemeno after the murder of her fiancee Alonzo de Piracquo. Set in the Spanish city of Alicant, this tragedy focuses on the amoral ? Beatrice-Joanna and her servant De Flores. For 10 points, name this play written by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley, which takes its title from Antonio, a man who pretends to be a fool.

answer: {Zeta} potential (prompt on {mobility} or {electrophoretic mobility mercifully} until mention)

[EM] Takeuchi et al found that this quantity correlated with cationic liposome transfection efficiency, and this quantity can be measured by Laser Dopper Velocitometry or Malvern's M3-PALS technique. It can be calculated from the Modified Booth Equation, or by the Henry equation by setting the constant to 1.0, known as the Huckel approximation. This quantity appears alongside Faraday's constant and ion valency in the hyperbolic cosine term of Dukhin's number. An equation that sets this quantity multiplied by permittivity over viscosity equal to the mobility is named for Somluchowski, and a procedure that is used to find optimum amounts of surfactants is a titration named for this quantity. Usually measured at the slipping plane?, a decrease in this quantity causes coagulation or flocculation. For 10 points, name this quantity, the potential difference between the dispersion medium and a layer of fluid attached to a dispersed particle, an important measure of colloid stability.

answer: A {Fragment} on {Government}

[JV]In a footnote in this work, the author claims that if we cannot legislatively define murder, then we should burn all our statutes and rely on only Pufendorf and the Bible. This work notes that Hume has demolished the "chimera" of the "Original Contract" in the first section, while the second section sarcastically notes that the choice of the type of titular concept might as well be decided by the neighing of a horse. This work's last section contains an apology for the preceding "logomachy," and argues that a certain thinker has erred in proposing a "Duty of the Supreme Power to Make Laws." The same logic that is used to prove that a certain document is "all-perfect" is shown to equally prove that the same document is "all-foolish" and "all-knavish," in a section of this work entitled "The British Constitution." The first two sections of this work are dedicated to the "Formation" and "Forms" of the title institution, and this work was conceived as a response to ?Blackstone's commentaries on the laws of England. Famous for its opening which states the "fundamental axiom," that "it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong," for 10 points, identify this early work of utilitarianism written by Jeremy Bentham.
