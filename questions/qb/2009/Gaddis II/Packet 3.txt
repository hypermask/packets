answer: {non}-{Newtonian fluids} [do not accept or prompt on "fluid," as the first sentence uniquely applies to non-Newtonian fluids and not other kinds; besides, who would think this tournament would have a tossup on "fluids"?]

If the curve-fitting parameter ? in the Carreau equation is nonzero, then that equation describes these entities, and they are also described when the curve-fitting parameter n in the Ostwald-de Waele model is unequal to one.  One class of them is named after Boger, and some of their properties can be measured by the Bostwick test.  The Herschel-Bulkley model of these entities is a generalization of the Bingham model, which describes these entities as “plastics.”  Another type of these entities is named after Casson and displays shear thinning above the ? yield criterion, and another group can be divided into rheopectic and thixotropic varieties.  For 10 points, give the general term for these objects that include blood and ketchup, which do not have a constant value for viscosity.

answer: the {Robbers Cave} experiment

[JM] Frances Cherry criticized psychology textbooks for only discussing the final version of this experiment because of its "happy ending." This experiment took place a year following a similar one in upstate New York, which ended when the subjects mutinied against the psychologists. It began its "contact" stage with a bean-tossing exercise. During its second stage, a group of subjects sang the theme from Dragnet while carrying a specially designed flag--those subjects later sang "Taps" while Mason burned a different flag. The subjects of this experiment conducted violent raids and began using insults like "Ladies first" before its third stage, where efforts to fix a broken water truck began to reduce tensions between the Rattlers and the Eagles. In this experiment, intergroup ? prejudices were inflamed by direct competition and then decreased by superordinate goals. For 10 points, name this experiment performed on two groups of eleven-year-old boys at the namesake summer camp in Oklahoma, conducted by Muzafer Sherif.

answer: {Pietism} [or {Pietismus}]

[MB] One offshoot of this movement placed extra emphasis on the atonement of Jesus and was principally followed by Moravian immigrants on the estate of Nikolaus Ludwig.  The "father" of this movement authored a "Heartfelt Desire for a God-pleasing Reform" where he outlined a "Conspectus of Corrupt Conditions in the Church" including "Defects in the Common People".  Adiaphora was warned against by one leader of this group, Bengel, and the History of Heresey and the concept of a female personification of wisdom called Sophia was advanced by its radical offshoot, led by Gottfried Arnold. Johannes Tauler's Theologica Germanica is a direct influence on this movement and Max Weber argued that "the virtues favoured by [this movement]" rewarded the "faithful official ... or domestic worker, and ... the predominantly patriarchal employer" in a section of The Protestant Ethic.  For a time this movement was centered at the University of Halle  under the influential leadership of ?August Hermann Francke.  With Anabaptistism, it influenced the later Schwarzenau Brethren.  Influenced by such mystics as Meister Eckhart, for 10 points, name this 17th and 18th century German off-shoot of Lutheranism that placed special emphasis on personal faith.

answer: First Battle of {Tannenberg} [or Battle of {Grunwald}; or Battle of {Grunfelde}]

[MB] Prior to this engagement, the victors set up camp at Faulen, and a detailed account on this "disaster" is given in a book by Stephen Turnbull.  Although it was followed up by the taking of Reden and the Battle of Koronowo, the losers in this battle were able to preserve their control over the fortress at Marienburg after an abortive siege.  The defeated party at this battle gave up Samogitia and had to pay an 850,000 pound ransom as a result of the First Treaty of Thorn, while a pivotal role was played by Nicholas von Renys, the leader of the ? Lizard League.  It also saw the death of Ulrich von Jungingen, the Grand Master of the losers.  For 10 points, name this victory for the Polish-Lithuanian faction over the Teutonic Knights in 1410, partially avenged by a later battle of the same name on the eastern front in World War I.

answer: {Guard} cells [prompt on {stomata} until mentioned]

[EM] Channels in these cells become hyperactive upon the application of a farnesyltransferase inhibitor or deletion of the ERA1 gene, and these cells develop from the same structure as trichomes and pavement cells. These cells use an enzyme that converts violaxanthin to zeaxanthin in one response pathway, which relies on the NPQ1 gene. These cells require AAPK autophosphorylation and a variant of the 14-3-3 protein to respond to abscisic acid, which is done via a cytoplasmic receptor and calcium signalling, and are also activated in response to blue light. Their activations is caused by pumping out of ? hydrogen ions and a subsequent influx of potassium, causing them to become turgid. For 10 points, name these cells that control gas exchange in plants by surrounding and sometimes blocking stomata.

answer: The {Devil's Dictionary}

[JM] In this work's preface, its author claims that it is addressed to "enlightened souls who prefer dry wines to sweet, sense to sentiment, wit to humor, and clean English to slang." This work contains a story about a rogue who presents gunpowder as the seed of Flashawful flabbergastor to agriculture secretary James Wilson, who is then pursued by a pillar of fire after planting it. It notes that New Jersey's use of the electric chair is "the first instance...of anybody questioning the expediency of hanging Jerseymen," and argues that Walt Whitman's poetry and God's mercy to man are incompossible. This book includes fictional poems, including many by Father Gassalasca Jape, and characterizes a harangue as "A speech by an opponent, who is known as a harangue-outang." Other sections of this book describe a Christian as "one who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life of sin" and refer to the brain as "an apparatus with which we think that we think." The first of its ? twenty-six sections distinguishes between an academe with an E, or "an ancient school where morality and philosophy were taught," and an academy with a Y, or "a modern school where football is taught." For 10 points, name this collection of cynical epigrams by Ambrose Bierce.

answer: {Contingency}, {Irony}, and {Solidarity}

[JM] The first section of this book argues that Davidson and Wittgenstein "treat alternative vocabularies" like tools instead of "bits of a jigsaw puzzle" to be solved. This book argues that the character of O'Brien in 1984 was not intended to be "a modern counterpart to Thrasymachus" but a person who was "dangerous" and "possible," in a chapter titled "the last intellectual in Europe." It borrows Harold Bloom's conception of the "strong poet" to label people who redescribe reality through metaphors, and contrasts the "common-sensist" and the "metaphysician" with a type of person who believes that "cruelty is the worst thing we do." This book analyzes Pale Fire in its chapter "The Barber of Kasbeam," and argues that humans express morality with "we" statements, that divide people into "we" and "them." It asserts that a "liberal Utopia" would consist of people who express the second title concept privately and the ? third title concept publicly. Arguing that literature, not philosophy, strengthens the third and final title concept, for 10 points, name this 1989 book by Richard Rorty.

answer: {Kandinsky's Improvisations}

[TG] One work in this series shows a row of gravestones below a figure representing the rider of the Apocalypse holding a scale and features several appearances of ladders, while the second member of this series was inspired by the creation myth of the Kalevala in its depiction of a “broken eggshell.” Another painting in this series centers on a figure that is the conflation of St. George and the “World-Watching Man,” while others are titled “Rowing,” “Dreamy,” and “Ravine.” Two large guns emitting orange-lined blasts on the bottom right provide the title for the thirtieth member of this series, “Cannons,” while the thirty-first member of this series shows a conflict in which a blue ship fires cannonballs at another ship. This series of paintings including one titled “Sea Battle,” was an attempt to illustrate the “inner sound” of color and imitate music demonstrating theories the artist outlined in his book ?Concerning the Spiritual in Art. Often studied alongside a similar series of works titled “Compositions,” for 10 points, name this series of abstract paintings with a musical title created by the Russian artist who painted Der Blaue Reiter.

answer: {N}-{body problems} or simulations

EM] One method of simulating these systems is P-cubed-M, which is a generalization of a method that constructs a potential across a grid and solves the Poisson equation. In addition to these particle mesh methods, another method developed by Rokhlin and Greengard involves expanding Greens functions and measuring forces between source and sink cells, called the Fast Multipole Method; that method is an expansion of a technique that uses an octree to divide space into cubic cells, known as the Barnes-Hut method. A hybrid method called GADGET was used by the Millennium Run, which managed to simulate a cube of space 2 trillion light years on each side. Used to simulate the formation of galaxies and star clusters from dark matter, the underlying problem of these simulations were proven to be solvable by Qiudong Wang, almost 100 years after a prize ? to solve it was given by King Oscar II. For 10 points, identify these simulations which show the evolution of a multitude of particles under gravity, used to show patterns of structure formation.

[JM] This figure is insultingly called a "hand-clapping beast" in a fragment by Telephus. The fora of numerous Roman cities included statues of this figure grasping a wineskin with his left hand and raising his right hand into the air to symbolize libertas. According to Nonnus's Dionysiaca, this figure was turned into a river which flows into the Maiandros. His father is variously said to be Hyagnis, Oeagrus, or Olympus, and most myths agree that this follower of Cybele taught himself to use an object cast away by Athena after she saw her reflection. In Plato's Symposium, Alcibiades compares the words of Socrates to the sounds produced by this figure. According to Pseudo-Hyginus, ? Midas was punished with asses's ears for ruling in favor of this figure, who lost a competition at Aulocrene when he was unable to play his instrument upside down. For 10 points, name this flute-playing satyr who lost a musical contest to Apollo, and was subsequently flayed alive.

answer: the D major {violin concerto} of Johannes {Brahms} [accept {Opus 77} before mentioned]

[JM]  This work's second movement, in F major, follows an ABA form, and includes a section marked "piu largamente" in F sharp minor containing variations of a pastoral theme first stated by a solo oboe. In its first movement, the soloist enters in the ninetieth measure playing the main theme in a minor key. The composer of this piece spent a summer in Pörtschach teaching Marie Soldat to perform it. This composition uses extensive double-stopping in its final movement, whose extended coda transforms the theme of a "rondo alla Zingarese" into a cheerful Hungarian march. This piece was originally intended to be four movements, but its composer discarded the middle ones in favor of one he termed "a feeble Adagio." Its composer's opus 77, it was the last major concerto to leave a blank space for the performer's cadenza. Written in 1878 for Joseph Joachim, for 10 points, name this D major concerto for a solo string instrument by the composer of the ? Academic Festival Overture.
