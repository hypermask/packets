answer: {Alexander} the {Great}

 A medieval legend about this figure saw him take a dog that would float, a cat that would purify the air and a cock that would crow when it was day undersea with him in a glass sphere so that he wouldn't drown. His sister, after losing the plant of immortal life, jumps overboard and is transformed into a mermaid at the bottom of the sea; that sister, later known as Gorgona, will destroy sailors during a storm if they do not acknowledge he still rules the world. Sometimes called “The Two Horned One”, in Arabic traditions he was said to be a son of Darab. In Christian traditions, he supposedly entered into Heaven by grabbing on to some griffins. Another legend about this figure sees him being shown a basalt statue of his alleged father Nectanebo, and in some accounts he pulled a pin out of a relic residing in Telmissus in Phrygia. For 10 points, name this historical figure who legendarily cut the Gordian Knot.

[MB] After earlier calling for his party to "turn its face to the countryside", this leader later contended "the kulak in the countryside is more dangerous ... than the nepman in the town".  This man uncharacteristically opposed the April Theses, although he had earlier served as the co-editor of the journal Sotsial-Demokrat with his mentor.  This leader of the "New" Opposition of 1925 joined forces with the Left Opposition and another man to form the United Opposition.  His role as the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Comintern led him to be attributed to a document allegedly composed by the husband of Mrs. Bellgrade. Sentenced to death in a Show Trial involving the murder of Sergie Kirov, this long-time partner of Lev Kamenev attempted to oppose the rise of both Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin.  For 10 points, name this Bolshevik leader, a one-time "right-hand man of ? Lenin" who was accused of authoring a namesake letter calling for a proletariat revolt in England that was blamed for losing Ramsay MacDonald the 1924 Parliamentary Elections.

answer: {Fischer}-{Tropsch} process

[EM] The mechanism of this reaction was explained by the Craxford theory and Eidene's methylene radical theory, although the Storch-Golombic-Anderson mechanism, which goes through an ethanol-like intermediate, is currently accepted. Zinc oxide can be used to slow sulfur poisoning of the catalyst in this process, which is usually a cobalt or iron compounds.  The water-gas shift is used to alter the distribution of inputs to this process, and this process's products are distributed such that W sub n divided by n is equal to a polynomial in terms of chain growth probability, known as the Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. When combined with biomass gasification, it can be used to create biofuels, and it was originally developed by its namesakes at the Kaiser Wilhem institute to create “ersatz” fuels. For 10 points, name this process that uses a syngas of CO and hydrogen to create synthetic petroleum from coal or natural gas ? , one of who's namesakes shares his surname with the namesake of an esterification and a projection.

This man's namesake effect results in alteration of properties in crystals due to dislocation of atoms via radiation.  His distribution function is the quantum analogue of the Boltzman distribution function. This man is the partial namesake of a distribution which is analogous to the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution, and which gives the cross section of neutron scattering as a function of energy. In addition to a formula with Breit, he co-names a theorem which implies that matrix operators can be factorized as a product of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the reduced matrix element along with Eckart. A primitive cell that spans an entire Bravais lattice is named for him ? and Seitz. The coupling of angular momenta in higher dimensions requires the use of his symbols.

[AR] The author claims that the most telling evidence of the conditions that are the focus of this work can be found by listening to the AM Radio for one consecutive hour for a few days, and claims that such works as Vance Packard's The Hidden Persuders and Fred Crook's The Warfare State are of vital importance to overcome "The Paralysis of Criticism." In a section titled, "The Catastrophe of Liberation": riding in a new automobile, taking a walk in the country, the subway during evening rush hour are examples of banal harmonization the author cites to explicate the absorption of the positive into the negative in what is known as the grand "integration of opposites." Modifying Freud's concept of the Pleasure Principle in a chapter entitled "The Conquest of the Unhappy Unconsciousness" the author of this work coins a term, which denotes the giving up of sovereignty for the sake of vulgar material pleasures, and is known as "repressive desublimation." Arguing that advanced technological society has created ?"false needs," the author articulates the need for the "Great Refusal" in order to overcome the oppression of political ideology and the constricting and compressive effects of mass media. Subtitled, "Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society," for 10 points, name this work about the title individual "flattened out" by modern society, written by Herbert Marcuse

answer: {New Madrid Seismic Zone} [Prompt on {Reelfoot Rift} before mentioned; do not prompt on {Mississippi Embayment}]

[CC] Although the Enola Swarm was located near this area, it was not related to activity within this region. Located at an aulacogen that resulted from the failed Rodinia mid-continent rift, it was re-activated in the Triassic and experiened extensive instrusive igneous activity. A related area named for the Wabash River is located to its north and a related fault was recently discovered near Marianna to its south. A temblor near Marked Tree in 1843 delineated its southern limit while future activity within this area atop the ? Mississippi embayment could be on the level of an 8.0 event that resulted in numerous sand blows, cross-river exclaves like Kentucky bend, and the complete destruction of a namesake community. With most of its activity generated by a fault called the Reelfoot Rift, for 10 points identify this seismically active area located in West Tennesse, Eastern Arkansas, and the Bootheel of Missouri that produced a series of major earthquakes in 1812 and 1813.

This king appointed George Norman superattendant of his country's church, and was advised by the counselor Conrad von Pyhy. He ordered the execution of Bishop Sunnanväder to quell a revolt in Dalarna, and his aggressive taxation led to Dacke's rebellion against his rule. This king supported the reformers Olaus and Laurentius Petri, and confiscated most of the property of his country's Catholic Church at the Diet of Västerås. He signed the Treaty of Malmö to end his successful rebellion against Christian II, which emancipated his country from the Kalmar Union, and established a royal house whose later members included Sigismund III and Queen ? Christina. For 10 points, name this ruler who liberated Sweden from Denmark and became its king in 1523, the grandfather of Gustavus Adolphus.

[GK] Tim Hunt's studies on the oscillatory levels of cyclins were first performed on A. punctulata, which is one of these organisms.  Th-nectin and Pl-nectin are analogues of fibronectin found in two specific species to this type of organisms, and the earliest zygotic protein expressed in these organisms is simply called the hatching enzyme.  Bindin proteins, found in sperm cells of these organisms, are involved in species specific interaction of sperm and egg cells, and unlike mammals, their acrosomal reaction doesn't require the binding of the sperm to the zona pellucida. The larval stage of their development is called pluteus. These organisms can be induced to release their gametes by injecting 0.5 molar potassium chloride in the region surrounding their mouths, and they are commonly used in developmental biology to study external fertilization ?. For 10 points, identify these echinoderms, examples of which include Aristotle's lantern, and which derive their name from Old English for "hedgehog" according to Wikipedia.
