answer: {Cahn}-{Ingold}-{Prelog} Priority Rules

[AR] External formats which utilize this convention include SMILES and Sybil Line Notation. One limitation of this convention is constitutional incompleteness, for which Custer has proposed a compatible extension, and occurs when a loss of information is incurred by mapping the original molecule's graph onto a hierarchical diagraph. A second limitation is referred to as the reconstruction problem, and for homo-substituted cycloalkanes the resulting ambiguities generally increases with ring sizes greater than 7.  Multiply bonded atoms are considered as if they were the equivalent of singly bonded ones, and the descriptors ?R and S indicate in what direction the lowest ordered substituent is pointing. Having the benefit of being independent of both the magnitude and the sign of rotation, for 10 points, identify this triply eponymous set of rules used for specifying the sense of chirality at tetrahedral stereogenic centers.

answer: {TUNEL} Assay [accept {Terminal Transferase dUTP Nick}-{end Labeling} until mentioned]

[EM] One negative control used in this assay is a Leukemic cell line treated with campothecin, and Kraupp et al treated rat liver cells with CPA and NAF to show that the original formulation of this assay was non-specific.  One more sensitive alternative to this procedure uses FTIC conjugated to Annexin V alongside propium iodide, while another alternative to this assay uses Hoescht 33258 and 7-amino-actinomycin. Cells that are positive for this assay will usually also exclude the dye tryphan blue, and this procedure can be combined with flow cytometry by using a monoclonal antibody against Br-dU. Originally described by Garvrieli, Sherman, and Ben-Sasson, this assay uses a TdT ? enzyme to add a particular substrate to double-strand breaks. For 10 points, name this assay used to detect apoptosis in fixed cells, whose name is an acronym for Terminal Transferase dUTP Nick-end Labeling.

answer: {Klein}-{Nishina Formula}

[AR] The results of this equation only become important when the bulk Lorentz factor is greater than 103 in the radiative deceleration of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei. When the effect that this equation is most associated with occurs in a magnetic field, the deviation from this equation results in an oscillation in the spectral distribution, which is inversely proportional to one minus the quantity Beta times the cosine of the critical angle between the initial momenta of an electron and a photon.  It produces a sharp maximum in the shortwave region due to the emission of very hard gamma-quanta from the collision of optical and x-ray photons with non-relativistic electrons. Reproducing the Thomson result for low-energy photons, one of its namesakes co-developed a relativistic form of the Schrodinger Equation with Walter ?Gordon.  For 10 points, name this doubly-eponymous equation which produces the differential cross-section of high energy photons in Compton Scattering.

answer: the {Cambridge Platonists}

[AR] They rejected a liberal movement advocated by such figures as Johann Crell, Johann Völkel and Johann Von Wolzogen known as Socinianism.  Disciples of this movement included such latitudinarian divines as Simon Patrick, Edward Fowler, and Edward Stillingfleet. Such sermons as "The Act of Oblivion," "Spiritual Opticks," and "The White Stone" by one of its marginal members, Nathaniel Culverwell, were eventually rejected by many of this movement's leaders. One member of this group begins with a demonstration of the existence of God, utilizing the principle of consensus gentium in the first volume of a planned three volume treatise, begining with the True Intellectual System of the Universe. Another member of this group, wrote the work which formed the Ur-narrative for Matthew Arnold's The Scholar Gypsy, called The Vanity of Dogmatizing. Major works associated with movement include Antidote to Atheism and Immortality of the Soul. Originating as a reaction to some of the severe tenets of ? Calvinist theology specifically Calvin's doctrine of deus obsconditus, they held that nature and revelation were only different hypostases or emanations of the divine goodness. Including such members as Benjamin Whichcote, Ralp Cudworth and Henry More, for 10 points, name this group of philosophers located at the eponymous institution which advanced the views of the author of the Ion.
