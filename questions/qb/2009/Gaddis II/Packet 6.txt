answer: the {piano sonatas} of Alexander {Scriabin} [prompt on partial answer]

[JM] According to their composer, the last movement of the second of these pieces, in G sharp minor, represents the "vast expanse of ocean in stormy agitation." The coda of the sixth is accompanied by the phrase "horror surges, mingling with delirious dance." The eighth one mostly contains three or four staves instead of the usual two. The third is nicknamed "soul states," while the final five are structured on the chromatic harmony C-F sharp-B flat-E-A-D, which their composer called the "mystic" chord. Their composer compared the brilliant trills of the tenth to "insects...born from the sun." The seventh one is a single movement, includes passages marked "very pure," and was considered holy by its composer. Their composer was afraid of performing the ninth one, which was nicknamed by Podgaetsky for its diabolical harmonies. Including pieces known as ? "White Mass" and "Black Mass," for 10 points, name this group of ten works for a solo instrument by the synaesthetic Russian composer of Verse la Flamme and Prometheus: Poem of Fire.

answer: {Nicholas Malebranche}

[AR] Berkeley claimed that no person's ideas were more fundamentally opposed to his than the ones of this person, and John Norris was the leading exponent of this thinker's doctrines in England. His biographer Father Andre notes that this philosopher's life-changing encounter with Descartes' Treatise on Man caused heart-palipating joy. This thinker argues that the cosmological order dictates that the beast is more perfect than the rock and the human more perfect than both, in a doctrine this thinker calls "the relations of perfection," in his Treatise on Morality. His regular and contentious correspondences with Arnauld and Regis prompted him to systematize his arguments in such works as Dialogues in Metaphysics and The Treatise on Nature and Grace. He extended Augustine's theory of illumination into a full theory of cognition, which includes a theo-ontologically grounded theory of sensory perceptions in ?Elucidations of The Search After Truth; a doctrine known as "Vision in God." For 10 points, name this 17th century French philosopher best known for his development of occasionalism.

answer: {Alans} [or {Alani}; or {Halauni}; or {Alauni}]

[CC] They initially conquered and assimilated the Nervii, Vidiani, Geloni, and Agathyrisi tribes and frequently warred with their Sarmatian neighbors. Although Tacitus neglects mentioning them, Arrian mentions this group as one of the first users of the "feigned retreat" nomadic tactic though he was able to defeat them in Cappadocia. This group, with capital at Yancai, was located near Kangju according to Han Dynasty chroniclers, and they defeated Greek king Gordian III at Philippi. Goar and Sangiban were some of this group's leaders in Gaul while Respendial led a contingent into Hispania, where after the death of Attaces one group of them dissolved into the Vandals. Their most direct descendents are the ?Ossete people of the Caucusus who speak the same Eastern Iranian language as this group did. The epithet most often associated with them was "fierce" and some of them participated in the December 31st 406 crossing of the Rhine. For 10 points, identify this nomadic group that fought against Attila at Chalons.

[JM] One of this playwright's title characters attempts to prove the existence of God by scoring one thousand points on a pinball machine, and crash-lands on a desert island, where he shits in such a way to make his feces spell "God is a son of a bitch." In one of this author's plays, people rent cars from Milos in order to have sex in them, and Tope betrays Emanou by kissing him, leading to Emanou's crucifixion. In another of this author's plays, the mother and father of the soldier Zapo visit him on the front lines of a war before all the characters are annihilated by gunfire. This author's amusingly titled plays include Striptease of Jealousy, Has God Gone Mad?, Heaven and Crap II, and The Crazy Crusade of an Obese Revolutionary. This author of The Architect and the Emperor of Assyria, Picnic on the Battlefield, The Automobile Graveyard, Guernica, and The Labyrnith was the founder of the Panic Movement.

answer: {Frank}-{Tamm} Formula or Equation

[AR] One modification for this equation replaces the square of the index of refraction by the real part of a dielectric function. The standard version of this equation addresses the infinite-track case, but for finite-track conditions in the Franhoufer limit, the primary difference is that the frequency dependence with flux is proportional to frequency squared. One of its namesakes, along with Sakharov, proposed an idea for a controlled thermonuclear fusion reactor, the Tokamak. It sets the average number of photoelectrons observed, N equal to 370 times the path length L times the integral of the detection efficiency, epsilon, times sine squared theta. Its formulators were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1958 along with its associated? phenomenon's namesake.  For 10 points, name this doubly eponymous equation that determines the radiation a charged particle emits as moves through a medium at superluminal velocity, Cherenkov radiation.

answer: Le {Corsaire}

[SJ] In Theatre Street, Tamara Karsavina claimed that one dance in this work is intended to say "Alas, I have no moustache, but my heart is as valiant as a man's own." Pyotry Gusev's 1955 version of this work discarded most of the original score and used airs from Si j'étais roi and La Jolie fille du gand and became the standard of the Kirov ballet. The American Ballet Theatre often keeps a scene taking place in a bazaar entitled Finesse d'amour and one section of this ballet opens with the firing of two prop muskets and is called the Danse des forbans. Vakhtang Chabukiani pioneered the slave role of Ali in one scene in this work, which often uses the Variation de la Reine des Dryades from its choreographer's Don Quixote. This work sees Pasha Seid buy Gulnara and sees Bibanto strike a deal with Lankadem. Karsavina was notable for playing the role of Medora in this work, who performs in this work's Le jardin animé, and a Riccardo Drigo nocturne entitled The Dream of Spring provides the music for this work's oft excerpted Pas de deux. Originally choreographed by Joseph Mazilier, most versions of this work are based on the choreography of Marius Petipa. For 10 points, name this ballet based on a Lord Byron work about some ? pirates, with music by Adolpe Adam.

[JM] According to one story, this figure told a parrot to lie down and close its eyes in order to escape its cage. In Japanese folklore, tumbler dolls depicting this figure are thought to bring good luck. This figure was poisoned six times by Bodhiruci and the Vinaya Master. According to another story, after this figure asked his four students to express their understanding, he told the three students who spoke that they attained his skin, flesh, and bones, and told the student who remained silent that "you have attained my marrow." That student demonstrated his zeal for becoming this man's disciple by slicing off one of his arms, and was named Hui'k-o. This figure is traditionally depicted with bulging eyes because he cut off his eyelids during meditation, and he is traditionally regarded as the founder of Shaolin Kung Fu. His teachings are recorded in the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices, and he was the disciple of Prajñ?dhara, making him the twenty-eighth patriarch of Buddhism.

answer: {beta galactosidase}

[GK] One assay used to measure its activity involves the introduction of FdG via hypotonic shock, and the accumulation of the product of that hydrolysis reaction, fluorescin, is a marker for the activity of this enzyme. The combined deficiency of neuraminidase and this enzyme occurs due to the lack of a glycoprotein which prevents the proteolytic degradation of this enzyme, and is called the Goldberg syndrome. This enzyme also carries out an isomerization to produce a product which, like IPTG, acts as in inducer for this enzyme by inactivating its repressor, whereas PETG is a reversible inhibitor for it. It is the product of a polycistronic mRNA which also codes for a ?permease and a transacetylase, and its activity can be probed by a colorimetric assay wherein a dark-blue product is formed from ONPG or X-Gal. For 10 points, identify this protein synthesized by the lac operon, which helps digest a namesake monosaccharide.

[JM] In one experiment measuring this effect, subjects were divided into two groups and watched separate interviews of a professor with a strong Belgian accent. In another experiment measuring this effect, Karen Dion gave female students an account of a seven-year-old who pelted a sleeping dog with sharp stones, and found that their analyses of the child's behavior were based on looking at a picture of the child's face. This term was introduced in "A Constant Error on Psychological Ratings," an essay by Edward Thorndike. Solomon Asch's article "Forming impressions of personality" examined the results of this effect on impression formation, finding that changing one out of seven characteristics of a fictional person from "warm" to "cold" caused subjects to drastically change the other characteristics ascribed to that person. Also studied in a 1977 experiment by Wilson and Nisbett, for 10 points, name this cognitive bias in which the perception of one strongly ? positive trait, like attractiveness, causes people to rate a person's other traits more highly.

[CC] J.C. Sabroux coined the term for this event, which may have helped create the fossil trove at the Messel pit. Tietze outlined the mechanics of this term while Villevieille suggested a possible preventive measure, the self-siphoning autonomous soda fountain. Non-nucleated CO2-saturated water in a meromitic environment is the major cause and lava flows from the 2002 Nyriagongo eruption were seen as a threat to cause one of these, but a lack of saturation at depth prevented another disaster like ones that had occured earlier in the Oku volcanic field. The most famous instance of this event resulted in an eighty foot high tsunami, a three hundred foot fountain of foam, and the destruction of the villages of Cha, Kam, and Subum as well as almost all life in the nearby valleys. For 20 points, identify these kinds of eruptions that occurred most famously at Lake Mounon in 1984 and more devastatingly at Lake Nyos in 1986, eruptions of enormous clouds of CO2 gas.
