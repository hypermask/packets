[GK] Johnsson and Varshavsky pioneerd the USPS variant of this technique. The SRS variant can be performed in cdc25-2 mutants wherein the GDP exchange factor Sos and a myristoylation signal allows localization of a protein to the cell membrane, resulting in viable cells at 36 degree celsius. Another variant relies on the introduction of an I-13-G exchange in the N-terminal region of ubiquitin, which binds to its C-terminal domain on another protein. The protein first utilized in this technique is now commonly used to achieve targeted gene expression in Drosophila and is called Gal4, and co-immunoprecipitation is an alternative to this screen. This assay involves the DNA binding and activation domains of a transcriptional activator being separated and fused to ? two proteins of interest, then coming together to induce reporter expression. For 10 points, identify this technique where which uses a "bait" protein to identify its "prey" targets, an important assay to study protein-protein interactions.

[MB] Prior to this battle, Jefferson C. Davis shot and killed Bull Nelson at the Galt House Hotel, while the battle itself saw Samuel Powell's troops successfully stall Union soldiers at Springfield Pike. Unusual terrain and weather conditions at this battle led to an "acoustic shadow" which resulted in generals on both sides not hearing the sounds of the morning battle and this battle's location was due to a few pools of water remaining on Doctor's Creek. The pincer movement enacted by one of the commanders created a mass of Union troops under General Alexander McCook at Dixville Crossroads. After this battle, one commander was able to join up his forces with Kirby Smith's at Harrodsburg, while George H. Thomas refused to accept a War Department order promoting him to head the Union troops prior to this battle.  The victorious Army of the Mississippi at this battle eventually retreated, and the armies involved clashed again at the Battle of ?Stones River at the end of 1862.  Seeing the Confederate armies under Braxton Bragg clash with the Army of Ohio under Don Carlos Buell, for 10 points, name this largest Civil War battle fought in Kentucky.

answer: {Gunn}-{Peterson trough}

[EM] One namesake of this phenomenon measured the redshift of BL Lacertae object with John Beverly Oke. Fluctuations in this effect can be accounted for by noting that the universe's photoinized gas cannot collapse on scales smaller than the Jeans scale, and applying the Zeldovich approximation can account for deviations in underdense regions according to Reisenegger. This effect is used as evidence that the interstellar medium transitioned to an ionized plasma between 150 million and one billion years after the Big Bang. The first object that showed this effect was observed by Becker, who found an object with z equal to 6.28 in the Sloan Survey, and this effect overshadows ? the Lyman-alpha forest at high redshift. For 10 points, name this feature which is caused by scattering of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, a suppression of wavelengths less than the Lyman-alpha line in quasar spectra.

answer: {intentionality}

[JV]In a 1957 monograph on this idea, Elizabeth Anscombe claimed that it is related to behavior for which it is appropriate to give a reason in response to the question of why it occurred, and that its internal manifestations are "without observation." This concept features in the title of a Hubert Dreyfus work about Husserl, this concept, and cognitive science, while eliminative materialists, most prominently Paul Churchland, have argued that this concept and its associated states do not exist at all. First formulated by Franz Brentano in his Psychology From an Empirical Standpoint, Roderick Chisohlm argued that this concept was the hallmark of the mental, and it is the subject of a 1983 work by John Searle which seeks to unite a theory of this concept with his earlier work on speech acts. Danniel Dennett has advocated that we assume conscious beings have this property, which involves taking a certain kind of ?stance towards them. For 10 points, identify this concept from the philosophy of mind which refers to the "directedness" or "aboutness" possessed by mental states.

answer: {Andreev} reflection

[GK/EM] One equation describing the probabilities of this process uses a one dimensional plane wave and a delta-function barrier, called the Blonder-Tinkam-Kapwijk model. Beenakker's formula relates the probability of this effect to the transparency, and he also showed that this effect is forbidden in half-metals. The suppression of this process is measured in a type of point contact spectroscopy named for it which is used to calculate spin polarization, and a "crossed" version of this effect competes against elastic co-tunnelling. SNS structures show multiple instances of this effect, leading to namesake bound states, while his effect requires the energy of the electron to be higher than the Fermi energy It occurs by transforming current to supercurrent and creates a Cooper Pair. For 20 points, identify this effect in which a hole is created, a type of reflection observed at the interface of a metal and superconductor, named for a Russian.

answer: The {Logic} of {Collective Action}: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups

 According to Russell Hardin, the models presented in this book do not account for the factors of political entrepreneurship and extrarational behavior. The fifth section of this book compares the "orthodox theories" of Bentley, Truman, and Latham. Its fourth section argues Marx failed to comprehend that self-interested individuals have no personal incentives to participate in class revolutions. This book sets forth a "taxonomy of groups" between "privileged" and "intermediate" groups, which provide goods because of unequal benefits or shared interests, and "latent" groups, which are so large that their members can default on their actions without being noticed, requiring selective incentives or coercion to prevent the free rider problem. Subtitled "Public Goods and the Theory of Groups," this book argues that "rational, self-interested individuals will not act to achieve their common or group interests." For 10 points, name this classic of public choice theory, an analysis of the behavior of interest groups by Mancur Olson.
