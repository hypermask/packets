[MB] One type of this data structure has a depth known as its resolution, and can contain a lower bound of 2 to the negative of the resolution number of side lengths.  An extensive analysis of these data structures is given by Samet, who notes that the amortized neighbor finding in them can be done in Big O of 1 time.  Several types of these data structures are differentiated by their handling of q-edges, although they all have the property that their leaf nodes are maximal.  Another variety of this data structure draws a line through the center of a node and recursively divides the node until each node contains at most one endpoint.  The general form of these data structures was first formulated by Finkel and Bentley in a paper on "A Data Structure for Retrieval on Composite Keys", and they come in varieties like Point Region and Polygonal Map, or PR and PM, respectively.  For 20 points, name this hierarchical structure often used for representing two-dimensional data, a type of tree where internal nodes have up to four children.

One of this man's theorems, which is used to create analytic continuations of Wrightman's functions, states that if a function is holomorphic in two contiguous wedges, its holomorphic throughout. In addition to that Edge-of-the-Wedge theorem, he is also the namesake of an inner product which is sometimes called the Kubo-Mori inner product. He is also the namesake of a canonical transformation that enables the diagonalization of quadratic Hamiltonians and was used by this man to come to an independent conclusion of the BCS theory. In addition, he is a set of equations along with Born, Green, Kirkwood, and Yvon, which describe the correlation funcitons of a many body system and which generalize to the Liouville equation for a system of finite number of particles. For 10 points, identify this Russian scientist, who lends his name to an ?inequality used to establish an upper bound on the Helmholtz Free energy of liquid metals along with Gibbs.

[AR] Pelizaeus–Merzbacher Disease and Spastic Paraplegia Type II can be caused by a mutation in the Plp gene which affects these cells' primary function. Some of the factors which influence these cells' differentiation from precursors include neurotrophin 3, GGF and CNTF. Their name was coined in 1921 after Del Rio-Hortega introduced a silver carbonate staining technique to selectively label them. One function of these cells is to synthesize the proteins connexin32 and connexin47 and it has been recently discovered that in the adult, a population of astrocytes located in the subventricular zone can “de-differentiate” to give rise to these types of cells. Apoptosis of these cells is thought to be triggered during ?Multiple Sclerosis and their functional analog in the peripheral nervous system are called Schwann cells. For 10 points name this type of glia found in the central nervous system responsible for myelination of axons.

[JM] One of this politician's speeches was roundly mocked for the line "Wherever I have gone in this country, I have found Americans." A song supporting this politician used the melody of "O Susanna," and affirmed that this man "learned a thing or two / he knows the right solution / And in the White House he will stay / within the Constitution." This politician lost much support by choosing John Hamilton as his campaign manager, and gave the "I Will Not Promise the Moon" speech attacking Social Security. This candidate's campaign slogan was "life, liberty, and" his last name, and his running mate was the publisher of the Chicago Daily News, Frank Knox.

[AR] The author of this work assents to Tardowski's distinctions for types of existence while engaging in a critique of Locke's Universal triangle, in order to put forth a kind of platonism for meaning and mental content, which this work derives from the ideas of Herman Lotze and a student of the author's. Another section of this work objects to the meaning of 'negation' in Sigwart's doctrine regarding the Principle of Contradiction, and in parroting Hobbes, this work suggests that in academia there is a war of all against in all concerning the doctrines of the title subject.  The second volume of this work presents six "descriptive-psychological" or epistemological inquiries on such topics as universals, meaning, and formal ontology of parthood relations or mereology. This work also comments heavily on the ideas of Mill and Spencer to generate an attack on the principles of ? psychologism that occupies most of the first volume. The author devotes a chapter to an analysis of Hume's theory of abstraction and its dependence on Berkeley, a topic that the author of this book takes up again in The Crisis of European Sciences.
