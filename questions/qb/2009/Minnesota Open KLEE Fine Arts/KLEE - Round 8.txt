answer: {Mr.} And {Mrs. Clark} and {Percy}

Some criticism about this painting discusses how a figure on the right side nervously digs his bare feet into a brown carpet. One figure stands in front of a table that carries a yellow book with no words written on the cover and a green vase with lilies, which evokes traditional Annunciation scenes and alludes to that figure's pregnancy. An etching from The Rake's Progress appears on the left, and this work is often considered a reversal of The Arnolfini Wedding as the dog representing fidelity is replaced by another animal that represents the libertine. In this painting the textile designer Celia Birtwell wears a flowing purple dress while standing in front of a shuttered window across from her husband who sits on the other side of the room in a blue sweater with a white cat on his knee.

answer: {Rokeby Venus} or La {Venus del espejo} or The {Toilet} of {Venus} or {Venus} at her Mirror or {Venus} and {Cupid}

Kenneth Clark argued that this painting was ultimately derived from a cast of the Borghese Hermaphroditus, and analysis established that a sheet in this painting was originally a deep mauve that has faded. José López-Rey argued that an excessive 1965 cleaning of this painting revealed "tentative contours", though that cleaning also provided evidence against a theory about the overpainting of a face, and López-Rey also argued that this painting used the same model that appears in the artist's Coronation of the Virgin for Elisabeth of Frances. A single brushstroke of black-laden paint was used to trace the line from the middle of the primary figure's back to her thigh, and a winged child drapes ribbons of pink and grey over the ebony frame of a mirror, which reflects the face of the primary figure, who is a brunette sitting on a sheet of grey-black satin. For 10 points, name this painting of a recument goddess of love staring at her reflection, a work of Diego Velázquez.

answer: Sergei {Prokofiev}

This composer was convinced to add a jovial coda to his final symphony, which originally ended with the melancholy ticking of the glockenspiel and xylophone, while he derived the structure of his second symphony from Beethoven's last piano sonata. In addition to creating The Children's Symphony, the first movement of this composer's sixth symphony features an oboe theme marked “dolce e segnando,” which reappears as a reminder of the “pains of war” in the final movement written in the ostensibly cheerful key of E-flat major. This composer's best-known symphony opens with a modern version of the “Mannheim Rocket” before the main theme is surprisingly repeated not in the expected dominant key of D-major but a whole tone lower in C Major. This composer uses a clumsy Gavotte instead of the graceful minuet in the third movement of his first symphony written in 1917 “in the style of Haydn.” For 10 points, name this composer of the Classical Symphony who included a noted “troika” movement in his suite about the fictional officer Lieutenant Kije and he also wrote Peter and the Wolf.

This artist drew a marriage portrait whose right side shows the temple of Juno, while the couple leans against an ivy-covered tree in the left foreground beside a thistle representing the pains of birth.  In another one of his paintings a child holding a lute wears a feathered beret suggesting the piece is an allegory for hearing because a feather on one's head legendarily corresponds to strong sensitivity.
