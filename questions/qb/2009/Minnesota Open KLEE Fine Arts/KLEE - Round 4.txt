answer: {Venus}, {Cupid}, Folly, and {Time} (accept {Allegory} of {Love} or {Allegory} of {Lust}

J. F. Conway argued that one character in this painting shares a resemblance with Enea Vico's Dolor proving the figure is a representation of “Il Morbo Gallico.” Margaret Healy asserts the character “Froda” from Dante's Inferno was the basis for a girl in this painting who has a serpent's tail and holds a stinger behind her back while innocently offering a honeycomb with her other hand. Much scholarly debate centers on whether an old woman who is pulling out her hair symbolizes syphilis, while a figure on the top left representing Oblivion attempts to cover the central action with a blue veil but is stopped by a bald, bearded man who has an hour glass appear above his head. Commissioned as a gift for Francis I, this painting features a nude boy believed to represent Pleasure or Folly, who is poised ready to throw a handful of rose petals on the main couple. The primary figure in this painting appears naked and holds a golden apple in her left hand while in her other palm she grasps an arrow, which she has taken from her nude son who she is about to kiss. For 10 points, name this allegorical depiction of the goddess of love by Bronzino.

answer: {Emmanuel Chabrier}

One work by this man is a quadrille based on favorite themes from Tristan und Isolde called Souvenirs of Munich. One of his operas contains the "Danse Slave" and "Fete Polonaise," and another centers on the love between the Danish pirate Harald and the title Saxon girl. One of his piano works contains sections like "Idylle" and "Paysage," and some sections of that work, Piéces Pittoresques, were orchestrated in his Suite Pastorale, which proved more successful than the aforementioned opera Gwendoline. He also composed an opera in which King Ouf is informed that he will die within 24 hours of Lazuli, as well as a work originally called Jota which started the trend of Spanish-inspired music continued by Debussy's Iberia and Ravel's Rapsodie Espagnole. For 15 points, name this French romantic composer of L'Etoile and the orchestral rhapsody España.

answer: {red}-{figure vase} painting (prompt on "{vase painting}" and similar)

One early proponent of this style, who gave more space to narratives by eliminating excess decoration, was the Berlin Painter, while another, the Wedding Painter, made a notable depiction of a man having sex with a bent-over prostitute, whose moneybag hangs on the wall. This style was used for one early female nude, depicting a servant girl preparing to bathe. Foreshortening can be seen in a depiction of three revelers done with this technique, while another example, rejecting the traditional composite depiction of the human body, shows a mythological character wrestling a giant. The transition between this technique and its predecessor was effected through bilingual works like one of Achilles and Ajax playing a dice game, by its probable inventor, Andokides. Used by Onesimos, Euthymides, and Euphronios, for 10 points, name this technique involving painting forms on a black background, allowing for greater detail on ceramic than the earlier black-figure decoration of amphoras, kylixes, and so on.

answer: {Sketches} of {Spain}

This album's fourth track is based on the “arrow of song” sung during religious processionals honoring the crucified Christ with the part of the soprano vocalist being substituted with the trumpet part. A “morning song” from festival season inspired this album's third piece “The Pan Piper” and its fourth track is the aforementioned “Saeta.” Midway through this album's first track the music lightens as the muted trumpet joins with the bass played by Paul Chambers, and that piece begins with a quiet castanet solo leading to the full orchestra's entrance including the drums and percussion played by Jimmy Cobb and Elvin Jones. Conductor Gil Evans helped arrange Joaquin Rodrigo's “Concierto de Aranjuez” and Manuel de Falla's “Will o Wisp” for this album. For 10 points, name this 1960 album by Miles Davis inspired largely by Iberian folk music.

answer: {L'homme armé} or The {Armed Man}

Noted Welshman Karl Jenkins was commissioned by the Royal Armouries to create a setting of this piece to mark the new millennium. Probably the earliest polyphonic use of this is in a combinative work along with Il sera per vous combatu, traditionally ascribed to Robert Morton. One cycle of six masses based on this piece, dedicated to Queen Beatrice of Hungary, was found in Naples in 1925 by Dragan Plamenac, muddying the waters of its origin. Pietro Aron claimed in his Toscanello that Antoine Busnoys wrote this song, although it is traditionally held that Guillaume Dufay first set this work to a mass. Josquin des Prez created two of the most well-known masses of it, including one "sexti toni" and one "super voces musicales".   For 10 points, name this chanson which states that the title character "should be feared" because of his weaponry.

answer: Claude {Lorrain} or Claude {Gellée}

One of this man's paintings depicts a man in blue next to a ruined temple as he fits an arrow to shoot a stag that lies across a small river, while another depicts some nymphs sitting on a rock overlooking a small stream with swans. One painting shows a group gathered around a man and a woman who dance in a circle with tambourines with a water mill in the background. Besides his Parnassus and The Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah, this former apprentice of Claude Deruet and Augustin Tassi sketched views of Tivoli and Campagna as well as port scenes such as Cleopatra Disembarking at Tarsus. He painted Ulysses departing from the land of Feaci as well as Ulysses returning Chryseis to her father, and the latter painting inspired Turner's Dido Building Carthage. He collected his works in six paper books known as the Liber Veritatis. For 10 points, name this Baroque era French landscape painter, who took his name from the French Duchy in which he was born.

One thousand different colors characterize one of this man's sculptures, which features a spherical object covered in smiling faces decorated with colored petals. Besides Flower Mantango,  the movie First Love commemorates this man's six years of collaboration with Louis Vuitton and features a characteristic adorable, bouncing, multicolored creation resembling Mickey Mouse. One of this man's sculptures shows a nude young blonde man wrapping one of his hands around the sash-like stream of seminous fluid that spirals around his body. Another sculpture is of a scantily clad waitress with excessively large breasts. Besides sculpting The Lonesome Cowboy and Miss Ko2, a bunch of strangely coloured mushrooms covered with eyes are characteristic of his paintings, as in Smooth Nightmare.

answer: {Tannhäuser}

The second act of this opera climaxes in a septet describing an angel's descent from heaven. The Paris premiere of this opera provoked jeering from the Jockey Club due to the Act I ballet, leading the composer to ban all further Paris performances. In the first act of this opera the central character's prayers cause a mountain to vanish right before he silently watches a procession of pilgrims. The soprano rejoices at the return of her lover in the aria “Dich, teure halle,” while later another character expresses his love for her in the "Song of the Evening Star." In the final act of this opera the tenor learns that the Pope's staff has blossomed indicating he has been granted absolution by God. The title character of this opera loses the Wurtburg singing contest to Wolfram von Eschenbach, who wins the hand of his true love Elisabeth. For 10 points, name this opera beginning when the title poet escapes from the love palace Venusberg, composed by Richard Wagner.

answer: {Canaletto} or {Giovanni Antonio Canal}

A two volume study of this man's works by André Corboz argues that this man is not "photographic" and asserts that his subjects were "imaginary." He was strongly influenced by Luca Carlevarijs, while one of his students worked alongside Marcello Bacciarelli in creating paintings for the Royal Castle of Warsaw under the commission of Stanislaw August Poniatowski. One work, part of a group of this man's paintings owned by the Earl of Lovelace, focuses on a white Corinthian column with an escutcheon surmounted by the statue of a saint in front of a bridge, exemplifying a characteristic mixing of English and Italianate styles. This teacher and uncle of Bernardo Bellotto painted himself seated in a work commissioned by Thomas Hollis, which depicts Old Walton Bridge, and he showed the reconstruction of Campo San Vidal in his The Stonemason's Yard. Sale of his paintings was facilitated by the British Consul Joseph Smith, and his paintings depict places like the Piazzetta, the Rialto Bridge, and the San Giorgio Maggiore. For 10 points, name this painter of Venetian vedute.

answer: {Scheherazade}

The composer suggested that "one might see a fight" in the second movement of this work with the appearance of a martial theme. He originally intended to title the movements Prelude, Ballade, Adagio, and Finale, and Michael Fokine later adapted the music into a ballet. It opens with a gruff bass motif which emphasizes four notes of a descending whole-tone scale: E-D-C-A-sharp, and this work closes by depicting an encounter with a bronze horseman on a cliff. A string theme and a flute theme mingle in the third movement to depict the love between a young Prince and Princess, while the central character is represented by a solo violin theme introduced in the first movement, "The Sea and Sinbad's Ship." For 10 points, identify this symphonic suite by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov based on A Thousand and One Nights.

answer: {Louis} I . {Kahn}

This man created a building in which light filled the central room "like a silver chalice", as well as a set of four pyramid-topped pavilions, his First Unitarian Church of Rochester and the misnamed Trenton Bath House, respectively. He used local materials for a collaboration with Balkrishna Doshi, the campus of the Indian Institute of Technology in Ahmedabad, and made use of parallel barrel vaults with punctured grooves to let in outside light for his Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.  He included a mosque, which was skewed off-axis so as to face Mecca, in his concrete-and-marble National Assembly Building in Dacca, Bangladesh, and articulated his separation of "served" and "servant" spaces in a building notable for its cellular work-spaces and staircase-towers.  For 10 points, name this architect known for the monumental forms employed in the Yale University Art Gallery and the Richards Medical Laboratories at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught for many years.

answer: {Pieter} Cornelis {Mondrian}

This artist used a series of loosely painted horizontal lines to create the title landscape in his View from the Dunes with Beach and Piers, and the branches at the top of the title object are very dark blue in his Evening: Red Tree. Two women face up with their eyes closed while another looks straight ahead in one work, which features those purple-blue two women with red shapes and yellow Stars of David, respectively, next to their ears, a triptych known as Evolution. This painter made two Cubist-influenced Still Lifes with Gingerpot, and a more characteristic style can be seen in black-and-white works such as Pier and Ocean, created using plusses and minuses. Rhythm of Black Lines exemplifies his use of orthogonal black lines, which permeate his series of Compositions. This artist created a painting featuring blue and red squares within yellow lines representing the title New York City thoroughfare. For 10 points, name this De Stijl artist who painted Broadway Boogie Woogie.

answer: {London} Symphonies (prompt on {Haydn symphonies})

The first movement of one of these works opens with a slow rising scale that stops just short of the octave before reversing direction, and that movement soon turns into a 6/8 presto, and in its third movement, the cellos and basses play repeated D's to create dissonances against the melody of the flute, which editors often dismissed as a misprint. The eighth features the addition of triangle, cymbals and bass drum to create what the composer dubbed "Turkish music," and the premiere of another one saw a chandelier fall from the ceiling. One of these is named for the pounding of the timpani on E-flat which opens it, while the second movement of another one was intended to "make the ladies jump" by having a sudden loud burst at the end of a pianissimo section. Sponsored by Johann Peter Salomon, for 10 points, identify these compositions which include the "Drumroll," "Clock," and "Surprise" ones, the last twelve symphonies of Joseph Haydn, named for the city where they were composed.

The title character of this opera is the subject of the arioso "Sei splendida e lucante" before a dancing master leads a minuet and the title character sings the gavotte "L'ora, o Tirsi, è vaga e bella." The male lead sings of the title character's betrayal when she stops to gather her jewels in "Ah... mi tradisce", and expresses his love for the title character in "Donna non vidi mai" and that lead begs a captain to let him accompany his love on a ship. The protagonist sings "Sola, perduta, abbandonata" when her lover goes to search for water in the desert and this work opens with Edmondo partying in a square in Paris.

This work and its title figure were the subject of a study by Guillaume Glorieux and a dog at the bottom right corner quotes from Rubens' Coronation of Marie de Medici. In Looking at Pictures, Kenneth Clark says this painting is characterized by "PURE PLEASURE!"  and Clark also points out areas of colour, such as the lacquered red box by one lady's elbow, as well as the emerald green stocking and gold shoe on a woman wearing a lavender dress, who is offered the hand of a man in a russet vest taking a dance like pose. At the far right, two men stare at either a mirror or a pretty serving maid, while a man in a silver-gray overcoat can be seen staring at muted pink bodies of a depiction of Diana and the Nymphs. At the far left, a man in a white shirt is seen unpacking a painting of a French noble. This work was painted from nature, showing a large windowed salon with the walls covered in paintings.

answer: An {Andalusian Dog} or {Un chien andalou}

In one scene from this movie a character lays out a tie whose box fades in from the street below her apartment. One of the main characters in this film gropes the other's breasts through clothes, at times imagining her nude breasts and buttocks. At the end of this film, the two main characters meet happily on a beach, but they are dead and sticking halfway out of the ground by spring. One of those characters, upon being threatened, pulls in two pianos and two priests on ropes. A blind, androgynous figure pokes at a severed hand with a stick before being run over in one scene, while in another, a woman's armpit hair is compared to ants coming out of a man's hand. This film opens with a man sharpening a razor and slicing open a woman's eye, and nonsensical title cards read "eight years later" or "around three in the morning". Starring Simone Mareuil and Pierre Batcheff, for 10 points, name this early Surrealist film created by Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel.

answer: {Mathis der Maler} Symphony

In this symphony's first movement the folk-song “Es sungen drei Engel” is quoted three times being raised a major third on each occurrence. A Latin epigraph translating, “Where were you good Jesus, where were you? Why have you not come to heal my wounds?” is attached to this symphony's final movement, which begins with twisting recitatives on the lower strings. This symphony ends with a complex resolution based on the hymn “Lauda Sion salvatorem” leading to the entrance of the confident brass playing “Alleluia.” This symphony opens with three light G-major chords representing three Angels, and its movements are titled “Entombment,” “Angelic Concert,” and “The Temptation of St. Anthony” deriving their names from panels on the Isenheim Altarpiece.

This sculptor borrowed the motif of a dove descending to earth from his earlier piece Our Lady of Joy for a fountain sculpture constructed for the Music Center of Los Angeles. In addition to Peace on Earth he offered an abstract depiction of a girl with two braided pigtails in The Beautiful One, while Meditation and Figure are examples of his experimental “transparent sculpture.” One of his works depicts a figure holding a bird's claw in his right hand and strangling it with his left. Along with Prometheus Strangling the Vulture he also was inspired by classical themes for his piece Theseus Slaying the Minotaur and his statue commissioned for the guesthouse of Mrs. Rockefeller that shows Pegasus stamping his foot on a mountain.

answer: {Christ's Entry} into {Brussels}

In 2004, Joel Pelletier remade this painting by calling one character "Captain of the Hosts" and "The Greatest Political Thinker" while showing many of the title characters in American Fundamentalists. One more realistic-looking man pokes his head into the bottom right of this canvas, and he seems to be looking at a man dressed in red holding a pointy pole on a pedestal. On a platform on the right side, a man with a red face bends over and shows his pants with one orange and one blue leg at the viewer, standing next to another figure wearing green with red polka dots. The bottom of this painting also contains a skeleton wearing a black and green top hat next to a clown with a mostly orange face, who are marching far in front of a band wearing identical blue-and-gold hats with erect red tassels. Across the top, a large red pennant reads "VIVE LA SOCIALE" as the title character enters almost imperceptibly on a donkey. For 10 points, name this depiction of Belgium welcoming a religious figure with a parade by James Ensor.

One work for this instrument and orchestra depicts the entrance to Connia's Well as well as an object which symbolized the muse called Dathi. That work, The Five Sacred Trees, was written for Judith Leclair by John Williams, and Arthur Weisberg developed a system for this instrument designed to eliminate the need for flicking. Camille Saint-Saens allegedly stormed out of the premiere of one work due to its misuse of this instrument. Its Renaissance predecessor was the dulcian, and today it is made using the Heckel and Buffet systems. It plays above the low strings to introduce the first theme in Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony, and a high solo from this instrument opens Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. For 10 points, identify this double-reed woodwind instrument which represents the grandfather in Peter and the Wolf, whose "contra" variety is the lowest member of the woodwind section in the orchestra.
