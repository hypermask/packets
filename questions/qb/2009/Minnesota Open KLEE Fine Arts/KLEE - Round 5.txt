answer: On the {Transmigration} of {Souls}

Much of the text of this work was inspired by Barbara Haws. One section of this work describes "windows on the world," while one speaker in this work describes another character so handsome that girls would never talk to the speaker when he was around. The composer claimed that he avoided isolating the children's chorus to avoid the ethereal effect created in works like Mahler's 8th symphony, and this work repeatedly quotes Charles Ives's The Unanswered Question as the trumpet asks what the meaning of life is. The composer described this work as a "memory space, a place where you can go and be alone with your thoughts and emotions." One section of the text consists only of a list of names, while another contains fragments from the "Portraits of Grief" feature of The New York Times. For 10 points, identify this work for chorus and orchestra, a commemoration of the 9/11 attacks by John Adams.

answer: {Ara Pacis Augustae} or Altar of {Augustan Peace}

Paul Rehak claimed that one scene in this work did not depict an epic hero, as Johannes Sieveking had claimed, but rather the second king of the polity which created this work; his evidence includes the fact that an assistant to the main action did not have two living parents in the myth, as was custom. One part of this work features hanging garlands flanked by ox skulls, while another section has a topless female surrounded by furled cloths and riding a large bird on each side of a woman about to suckle two children, whose figure assimilated features of its patron's wife. Parallel sides of this edifice depict the imperial family and important people like senators, invoking the Panathenaic procession on the Parthenon frieze, while the main scene is thought to be Aeneas performing a sacrifice.

answer: {masses} by Giovanni Perluigi da {Palestrina}

L.L. Perkins argued that the 40th of these was based on a motet by Jean Lheritier, while the Dies Sanctificatus used the theme from the composer's own motet of the same name. Josquin des Prez's motet Benidictua may have inspired one of these 'without a title.' A Claude Goudimel work called 'Audi filia' provided the theme for the 'Brevis' one, while another of these was composed in honor of a man who reigned for only three weeks and supposedly convinced the Council of Trent not to ban polyphony. For 10 points, this is what set of compositions by a Renaissance composer which usually feature sections like 'Gloria,' 'Credo,' and 'Kyrie,' the most famous of which is perhaps the "Pope Marcellus" one.

answer: Symphony {No.} 7 (prompt for {Mahler} before his name is read; {also} accept {Song} of the {Night} or {Lied der Nacht} before mentioned.)

The composer claimed that the opening theme of this work came into his head as the result of stroking oars in a rowboat. The second movement features a military rhythm on col legno violins borrowed from the song Revelge, and the last movement takes the form of a rondo with eight variations, including a parody of Lehar's The Merry Widow, and the composer claimed that in writing that movement he wanted to depict the broad light of day. In the grim scherzo, the strings are instructed to play pizzicato at a dynamic of five F's, with the actual footnote “pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood.” The aforementioned opening theme is played by the tenor horn, and the fourth movement takes the form of an amorous serenade, with a horn solo playing above a guitar and mandolin. The work is symmetric in structure, with a central scherzo between two Nachtmusik movements. For 10 points, identify this symphony by Gustav Mahler, dubiously known as the “Song of the Night,” which preceded the "Symphony of a Thousand."

answer: {Van Dyck's Portraits} of {Charles} I (accept obvious equivalents)

John Moffitt argues that the best known painting in this series is influenced by Durer's Knight, Death, and the Devil because it borrows the print's lighting to indicate it is dawn. One of these works by this artist shows a man riding through an archway decorated with green drapes on a tamed wild stallion, while Seignior de St. Antoine walks on the right. Another one is a family portrait in which the primary figure sits in a red plush chair on an open portico, but is perfectly aligned with a classical column to suggest family stability. In addition to “The Greate Peece” another one of these works depicts the primary figure “from three angles” and was sent to Bernini as the basis for a sculptural bust. Several paintings in this series show the central figure wearing a gold locket inscribed with the image of St. George marking him as a member of the Order of Garter, while many works feature Henrietta Maria. A tablet with the Latin inscription, “CAROLUS REX MAGNAE BRITANIAE” appears in one of these works showing the central monarch “on horseback,” while another one shows him “at the Hunt.” For 10 points, name this series of paintings depicting an English king, created by a Flemish student of Rubens.
