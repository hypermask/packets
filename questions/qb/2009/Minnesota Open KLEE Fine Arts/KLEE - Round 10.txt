answer: {Arshile Gorky}

Two figures embrace in a candelit interior in this man's Hugging, the second of his two Good Hope Road paintings. Tremulous patches of green among amorphous red shapes characterize his The Sun, the Dervish in the Tree, while gray and yellow predominate in his The Leaf of the Artichoke is an Owl. One of his paintings shows a concave star shape with soft shapes resembling breasts on each side, and two other paintings of the same name make those breasts less prominent and feature predominantly white and yellow or purple and yellow petal shapes. Besides the Betrothal series, a thin and bare tree with skeletal branches splits the middle of his Landscape in the Manner of Cezanne, and he created a series centered around his painting Nighttime Enigma and Nostalgia. The influence of surrealism can be seen in one of this man's paintings, which was named by Andre Breton and uses indistinct dark green and brown hues to suggest a pastoral landscape.  For 10 points, name this Armenian painter of The Liver is the Cock's Comb.

answer: {Luigi Cherubini}

This man's early compositions include the intermezzo Il Giocatore and a cantata written for Duke Leopold of Tuscany, La pubblica felicitá. He was incorrectly informed of Haydn's death, leading to the premature composition of a Chant sur la mort de Haydn. He composed a Hymn to Spring for the Philharmonic Society of London, and he collaborated with Jean-Nicolas Bouilly to compose the opera Les deux journeés. Beethoven considered another of his works to be superior to Mozart's setting of the same text. That work was written in memory of Louis XVI and one of his operas was drawn from texts by both Euripides and Corneille. For ten points, name this Italian classical era composer who spent most of his life working in France, where he directed the Paris Conservatoire and produced a noted Requiem in C minor for mixed chorus as well as the opera Medee.

answer: Rietveld {Schröder House} or Rietveld {Schröderhuis}

Across the street from this building, its architect designed a row of four mansions much better matching modern architecture on Erasmus Lane. Each room in this building matches its patron's criteria of having a bed fit in at least two directions, direct water and drainage, and access to the outside, and a corner window looks out on the city near this building, providing light to the interior, as does the skylight in its flat roof. The designer of this building used his namesake joints in the design for his Red and Blue Chair. Its bottom floor has a kitchen, storage room, servant's room, reading room, and studio space, which the designer used for a few years as his own office. On the other hand, in order to provide expansive room for children to play in the day, and private bedrooms at night, the concertina walls on its upper floor can divide the area into one room or six, and its exterior used elementarism, which combined white and gray surfaces with horizontal and vertical accents in black and primary colors, a technique developed by Theo van Doesburg. Designed by Gerrit Rietveld, for 10 points, name this building in Utrecht, an architectural example of De Stijl.

answer: The {Madrigals} of {Claudio Monteverdi}

One collection of these works was originally labeled "Concerto" and features two "love letters" to be acted as well as sung, "Se i languidi miei sguardi" and "Se pur destina e vole." Gary Tomlinson claimed that "affective dissonance" drawn from Marenzio is found in "Baci soavi e cari." In the preface to the fifth collection of these works, their composer coined the term "seconda pratica" in responding to Giovanni Artusi's arguments against the transition from polyphonic to monodic style.  The fifth collection contains "Cruda Amarilli" and "O Mirtillo", both drawn from monologues in Guarini's Il Pastor Fido. The most famous volume of them contains "Or che'l cielo" and "Lamento della ninfa", was dedicated to Ferdinand III Hapsburg, and is titled for "war and love." That eighth collection was composed during its composer's time at St. Mark's in Venice.

answer: {Dvorak Cello Concerto} in B minor

This work's composer described how "the solo dies down to pp, then swells again... and the whole concludes in a stormy mood." This work alludes to the songs "Here in the forest" and "Leave me alone" from its composer's Cypresses and Four Songs. This piece was premiered by Leo Stern only after he sent its composer two rare pigoens, and its composer had written an A major assay into the same genre for Ludevit Peer, who never performed it. Its key was possibly based on the middle movement of Victor Herbert's attempts into the same genre, while Hanuš Wihan wrote parts of this work, such as the quasi Cadenza of the slow movement, and this piece was the subject of a famous recording by Pablo Casals in 1937. Premiered by the same orchestra that performed its composer's New World Symphony, for 10 points, name this B minor work for a certain instrument by Antonin Dvo?ák.
