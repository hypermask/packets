answer: "{Avant}-{Garde} and {Kitsch}"

This essay quotes from Yeats' "Sailing to Byzantium" while discussing how one title concept is "a superior sort of Alexandrianism" and "the imitation of imitating." This article derides Dwight MacDonald as "an ignorant Russian peasant" and offers him a hypothetical choice between paintings by Repin and Picasso, presuming that he will prefer the Repin though it stands no chance next to a cover by Norman Rockwell. It opens discussing how a civilization can produce works as disparate as a T.S Eliot poem and a Tin Pan Alley song and introduces the second title concept as that demanded by peasants to satisfy their boredom, making it the "debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture." Analyzing how the first title concept arose to defend aesthetic standards from the second, for 10 points, name this essay by Clement Greenberg.

answer: {Symphony} of {Psalms}

This work's composer pasted a drawing of the Crucifixion into his notebook and wrote the words "Adveniat regnum tuum." Its composer also claimed the 'human fugue' was illustrated by the uniting of two fugues on the words "Et immisit in os meum canticum novum", and that the second movement is an upside down "pyramid of fugues." Composed twenty five years before its composer's thematically similar Canticum Sacrum, triplet notes in one part represent the horses and chariot of Elijah, while the first movement is dominated by the opening e minor chord which takes its name from this work. It ends with an "Alleluia", and its second movement is a setting of "Expectans expectavi Dominum, et intendit mihi" while the first opens "Exaudi orationem meam." For 10 points, name this work which sets three of the title texts and celebrates its composer's belief in Orthodox Christianity, a work of Igor Stravinsky.

answer: {Felix Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto} in E minor

One man said that of all works in its genre, this work is "the most inward, the heart's jewel." In the transition to the second movement of this work, the bassoon sustains a low B which resolves up to C, while one theme in the first movement is introduced by the four winds while the soloist provides a pedal on the open G string. The composer partially inspired Tchiakovsky's work of the same genre by placing the cadenza in the first movement at the juncture between development and recapitulation. This work, which was premiered by and written for Ferdinand Davi, opens with a tune that "gave the composer no peace," written in the home key of E minor. For 10 points, identify this showpiece by the composer of A Midsummer Night's Dream which is likely to be performed by Joshua Bell or Itzhak Perlman.

answer: {Paul Taylor}

In one of his works, a man in a business suit with a red tie uses slashes of his hand to represent killing his own soldiers, and Santo Loquasto designed the costumes for one of this man's works set to Ponchielli's "Dance of the Hours." Besides Banquet of Vultures and a send-up of Troilus and Cressida, Robert Rauschenberg designed gray costumes with mirrors on the hand and head for this man's 3 Epitaphs. A white strip impedes movement or serves as a blindfold in a work set to Ligeti's "Musica Ricercata", Dante Variations.  A woman in pink leaps over six dancers on the ground in his Esplanade and a famous "backward run and leap" between Michael Trusnovec and Lisa Viola is the highlight of his Promethean Fire.

answer: Sesshu {Long} Scroll or {Long} Scroll of Landscapes or {Sansui Chokan}

This work, which was primarily composed in the shin style, shows a twisted flag resembling a figure eight and advertising wine as people gather amidst the foliage near an inn. A tree to the right of that inn was painted using a chrysanthemum pattern, a technique pioneered by this work's artist. Also characteristic is a porter with a sack over his shoulder, who appears in front of a pagoda, a detail inspired by its creator's time in China studying the paintings of men like Xia Gui. It  is dotted with depictions of Zen priests and their students, though it primarily consists of depictions of rocky landscapes and pine trees, and it bears strong similarity to its creator's later Short Scroll of Landscapes.

answer: {Hippolyte et Aricie} or {Hippolytus} and {Aricia}

In this work, the huge choral piece "Que ce rivage retentisse" is followed by a prayer to Neptune in "Puissant maître des flots", causing the sea to boil. This work sees the rivers summoned for judgment shortly before the first Trio des Parques, in which they sing "Du Destin le vouloir suprême." A group of hunters sing "O disgrace cruelle" when bewailing an apparent death at a grove of Diana's. This work ends with a shephardess singing "Rossignols amoreux" to celebrate the marriage of the title characters, and the father of one title character sings "Je ne te verrai plus!" when told he can never see his son again. That father had earlier descended to the underworld to retrieve his friend Peirithous, and is tricked by Oenone into believing his son had assaulted his wife. This opera triggered a war of styles between its composer and his rival Jean-Baptiste Lully.  Phaedra falsely accuses the son of Theseus, in, for 10 points, this opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau.
