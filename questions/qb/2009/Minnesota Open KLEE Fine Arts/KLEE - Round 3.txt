answer: {Guillame} de {Machaut}

Two versions of this man's Donnez signeurs have been preserved, and the triplum ‘Quant en moy vint premierement Amour' is thought to be his first motet. The three-voice Hoquetus David, possibly the last composition of its kind, may have been written by this man for the coronation of Charles V.  Four ballades complement the narrative prose and poetry of his two-part Prologue, which he appended to a collection of his complete works, and he explained the genesis of many songs such as his rondeaux and virelais in the autobiographical Le voir dit.  He may be best known, however, for a four-voice work in six movements which was probably written for Reims Cathedral; this work includes a section that would subsequently be omitted in most settings, the Ite missa est, and uses isorhythm in every movement save the Gloria and Credo. For 10 points, name this 14th-century French poet and composer whose wrote the first complete setting of the Ordinary by a single composer, his Notre Dame Mass.

answer: Toru {Takemitsu}

Much of this composer's work relies on a six-note motif called the "sea cipher," and he wrote a piece which juxtaposes a solo marimba against gongs and a log-drum, Gitimalya. In a work by him about a flock entering a garden, the F-sharp provides a consistent focus as the center of the pentatonic collection, and his first work for brass instruments was Garden Rain. Greenpeace commissioned his work To the Sea for alto flute and guitar, and earlier orchestral works include Coral Island and In an Autumn Garden. Works like his Quatrain and Lento in due movimenti display the clear influence of Messiaen, while he called Debussy his "great mentor" and quoted La Mer in his Quotation of Dream. He first rose to prominence with a Requiem for strings, and also wrote the score for the film Ran. For 10 points, name this composer who also wrote Rain Tree Sketch for piano but is probably best known for being Japanese.

answer: Symphony {No.} 41 (prompt for {Mozart} before his name is read, accept {Jupiter Symphony})

Eric Blom compared this work's predecessor to Phedre and this work itself to Iphiginie because of its subtle yet grand nature. Its third movement features the only time the composer ever wrote separate parts for basses and cellos in a symphony minuet. Its finale is based on the hymn Lucis creator, and towards the end of the first movement of this work, the composer quotes an aria written a few months earlier for Francesco Albertarelli to be inserted into Pasquale Anfossi's opera Le gelosie fortunate. That aria is "Voi siete un po tondo," and the opening of one section is identical to that of the finale of Haydn's thirteenth symphony. Its final movement opens with a simple C-D-F-E motif and all the material of that movement is later recapped in a five-theme fugue. For 10 points, name this final symphony by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, nicknamed for its jovial quality.

answer: {Ein Heldenleben} or A {Hero's Life} or A {Heroic Life}

A unison horn theme from the composer's second tone poem effects the transition between the fifth and sixth movements of this work, while in the second movement, the tuba mimics the name "Doktor Dehring." The composer selected the key of E-flat for this work to match Beethoven's Eroica symphony. In the third movement a solo violin carries the theme of the 'Beloved.' The penultimate movement features quotations from the composer's earlier works Guntram and Death and Transfiguration, which are described as "works of peace." Those quotations led this work's detractors to argue that the composer depicted himself as the title figure, and this work's ending recalls the opening of Also Sprach Zarathustra. For 10 points, identify this tone poem by Richard Strauss which portrays among other things the title figure's "Adversaries," "Companion," and "retirement from the world," and according to its title depicts some guy who goes on great quests.

Fra Bartolommeo's depiction of this scene shows three angels holding up a luxurious green drape, a color quoted in the interior of the main figure's dress as well as the robes of the surrounding figures. An enthroned Christ is surrounded by two rainbows at the right of a triptych devoted to this scene, which shows two black angels hold a crown in front of a golden cloth lushly decorated with maroon florals as the title figure is seated. Besides that triptych by Hans Memling, Correggio's depiction of this scene shows a smiling St. Sebastian looking over the shoulder of a woman wearing a gold dress, who plays with the fingers of an infant.

answer: {string quartets} of {Ludwig van Beethoven}

One of the composer's friends claimed that the first of these compositions was partially inspired by the tomb scene in Romeo and Juliet. After hearing one of these, Schubert remarked "After this, what is left for us to write?" The third movement of another of these works was written as the composer recovered from an illness which led him to call it a "Holy Song of Thanksgiving." At the advice of the publisher, the composer substituted a new sixth movement for one of these and republished the original movement as the "Grosse Fugue." The finale of the last of these has the header "The Great Decision" and the footnote "Must it be?" which is soon followed by "It must be!" The eleventh of these is called "Serioso," and the seventh through ninth of these were written for a commission from Count Razumovsky. For 10 points, name this set of 16 compositions for two violins, viola, and cello by the composer of Fidelio.

answer: {Knoxville}: {Summer} of 1915 [{GT/SJ}]

In this work, the singer hits a high of B-flat when singing of "who shall ever tell the sorrow of being on this earth", and hits that note earlier during the section "now is the night one blue dew."  This work's composer called it a "lyrical rhapsody", and early on it mentions how "the faint swinging bell rises again." The harp takes up the theme accompanying the words "rocking gently", and the text compares a spark to "a small malignant spirit set to dog" a trolley. This work opens with "It has become that time of evening" while the calm introduction of this work abruptly ends with an allegro agitato representing a streetcar passing by, but returns to the calmness at the end, when the soprano playing the role of a young child is tucked into bed. Commissioned for Eleanor Steber, for whom the composer later composed the lead in the opera Vanessa, for 10 points, name this work by Samuel Barber based on the prologue of James Agee's A Death in the Family.

answer: {Francisco} de {Zurbarán}

 Among this man's still lifes are a work showing a pewter plate with lemons and a basket of oranges replete with blossoms, as well as A Cup of Water and a Rose on a Silver Plate. He experimented with illusionistic effects with his fourteen versions of The Sudarium of St. Veronica, while another work features a woman in a dress of pink, yellow, and green holding a golden feather. One of his paintings, part of a series for a Hieronymite monastery, is suffused with amber light and uses swirls of paint to delineate the foreground, where Christ in a rose coloured robe greets the title figure. Another painting shows eight monks in characteristically detailed white robes seated and introspectively staring down at a table populated by bread as a young man faces the title figure. Influenced by Juan Sánchez Cotán, this painter of St. Apolonia and The Vision of Brother Andrés Salmerón depicted a cardinal's hat at the feet of a white robed man on a brocaded bier in a series on the life of St. Bonaventure. This man was succeeded by Murillo as the chief painter associated with Seville. For 10 points, name this baroque Spanish painter, known for his depictions of Carthusians, as in his St. Serapion.

answer: {Learning} From Las {Vegas}: The {Forgotten Symbolism} of {Architectural} Form

This work's appendix, an excerpt of an interview with Jesse Dukeminier, raises doubts as to the constitutionality of design review boards.  Earlier, it utilizes a series of Nolli maps and contrasts New Haven's "irrelevant" Crawford House with a building featuring a gilded antenna, its author's Guild House. Peter Blake's God's Own Junkyard provides the Long Island roadside stand with which modernism is identified in this work, since "space, structure and program are submerged and distorted by an overall symbolic form". Part One discusses advertising signage, artificial lighting, and (*) A&P parking lots, while Part Two, which makes a case for "ugly and ordinary architecture", proposes a blinking sign which says "I AM A MONUMENT", and introduces the concepts of the duck and the decorated shed. For 10 points, name this follow-up to Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture by Steven Izenour, Denise Scott Brown, and Robert Venturi, which sought to extract lessons from the architecture of the titular city's casino-filled Strip.
