answer: {Cosi Fan Tutte} or {Thus} Do They All or The {School} for {Lovers} or any reasonable {approximation} of either {translation}

In this work, big muscles and large moustaches are praised in the aria "Non siate ritrosi", while the possibility of love is said to sate one's hunger in "Un aura amorosa." Love is compared to a thief in the aria "E amore un ladroncello" by a girl who had earlier claimed she would die of grief in "Smanie implacabili." An "audacious person" is told to leave in the difficult "Come scoglio", and this opera sees a nurse disguise herself as a notary as well as a doctor who pulls out a large magnet to revive some men disguised as Albanians. The stupidity of wagering 100 sequins on woman is the subject of an arioso by Don Alfonso, and the primary female pair is urged to acquiesce by their maid Despina. One character gloats about the faithfulness of his betrothed though he managed to seduce Dorabella. For 10 points, name this opera featuring Guglielmo and Ferrando, who learn the title lesson, a work of Mozart.

He continued his predecessor Franz Tunder's tradition of holding Abendmusik concerts five Sundays a year, while his core of organ works includes 32 variations on the aria "La Capricciosa" as well as 19 praeludia. Another of his works is based on the poem Salve mundi salutare by Arnulf of Louvin and is a cycle of seven cantatas each dedicated to a part of Jesus's body, Membra Jesu Nostri. For 10 points, name this Danish-German composer whose organ skills inspired J.S. Bach to walk from Arnstadt to Lubeck just to see him play.

answer: {Aram Khachaturian}

This composer called his second symphony a “requiem of wrath” because its third movement features the “Dies Irae” played on the strings at half-tempo and is partially based on the folk song “Brother Hunter” about a mother learning about her son's death.

His aforementioned second symphony is titled “A Bell” and he wrote suites based on Lope de Vega's The Valencian Widow and Lermontov's Masquerade. One of his best known pieces consists of quick alternations between major and minor sevenths and appears in a work featuring the “The Dance of the Pirates” and “The Dance of the Rose Maidens.” The daughter of Avanes witnesses the death of Giko and helps entrap a spy trying to steal geological secrets in his ballet about a collective farm, which he wrote a decade before Spartacus.

answer: cadence

The "deceptive" variety usually moves to the submediant, the second movement of J.S. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto #3 is a famous "Phrygian" one of these, and one beginning on the subdominant is known as "plagal". A "perfect" one consisted of movement from five to one and was traditionally required at the end of a composition.  For 10 points, give this term which refers to the two-chord formula which affirms the tonality of a piece at the conclusion of a musical phrase.
