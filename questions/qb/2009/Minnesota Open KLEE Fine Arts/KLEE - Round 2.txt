answer: {Basilica} of St. {Denis} or {Abbey} of St. {Denis}

In a book about this building "and its art forms", Erwin Panofsky argued it was influenced by the ideas of Pseudo-Dionysus the Areopagite and that it represents Heavenly Jerusalem. The jambs and lintel zone of this building's central portal feature sculptures of the Wise and Foolish Virgins and two Atlantids. Golden axes in a circle once surrounded the altar of the throne, which joins the marble ciborium amongst the lost work Eligius did for this building. Once home to the oriflamme and founded by Dagobert I, this building was partially rebuilt by a man who wrote a biography of Louis VII and a panegyric on Louis VI. It marked the transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and the remains of monarchs buried at St. Genevieve were later moved here, alongside most French monarchs. For 10 points, name this building, rebuilt and led by Abbot Suger.

answer: {Symphonies} of Jean Christian {Sibelius}

The composer of these works described the end of the third one of them as "the crystallization of chaos", and that work's second movement ends with two "amen" cadences in E minor. One of these works, dedicated to Axel Carpelan, draws from sketches titled Don Juan and "Christus" and interrupts a scherzo with a long silence broken by five drumbeats descending from p to pppp.  James Hepokoski found "rotational form" in one of these works, and that work's third movement has markings such as "Misterioso", "Un pochettino largamente", and ends with "Un pochettino stretto",  as well as a triple time motif inspired by swan calls. The seventh quotes from the section "Where the Stars Dwell" from the tone poem Kuutar, and is a one movement "symphonic fantasy" in C Major whose Adagio quotes from the composer's Valse Triste. The eighth never materialized, likely burned by their composer twenty years after his Tapiola. For 10 points, name this set of seven works, the second of which is associated with the composer's call for Finnish nationalism.

answer: Frederic {Remington}

This artist caused controversy by referring to his piece depicting an emaciated old man with a long beard crouching next to an ancient tree stump as the “original inhabitant of Oyster Bay.” Along with The Paleolithic Man, he created a sculpture that remarkably does not have a single foot belonging to the three main figures touching the base as two athletes stand on the belly of an upturned beast during a game of Polo. He depicted a member of a patrol squad thrusting his sword through the hide shield of an escaping thief in Dragoons 1850, and his interest in Native Americans is also illustrated in The Cheyenne and The Scalp. His best-known sculpture was popularized when he gave a copy to Theodore Roosevelt and shows a cowboy attempting to hold onto the reins of a wild horse. For 10 points, name this artist known for his bronze sculptures about the American West who created Bronco Buster.

answer: {Orpheus} in the {Underworld} (accept {Orphée aux Enfers})

In this opera's second act, one character sings “I'm feeling all lonely and shivery” to a baritone whose part consists only of buzzing in the “Fly Duet.” The soprano is bored listening to one character's endless stories of his former role as the King of Boetia, and earlier the soprano argued death is not terrible in the aria, “La mort m'apparaît souriante” after being led to a cornfield where she was bitten by a snake before the shepherd Aristee's transformation. The character of Public Opinion coerces the protagonist into seeking his wife, who sneaks into a party disguised as a bacchante in this opera's final scene before Jupiter's attempts to lead a minuet fail as the party dances the “Galop Infernal,” which provides the tune for the “Can-Can.” For 10 points, name this opera satirizing Gluck in which the titular bard descends to the domain of Pluto to find his wife Eurydice, composed by Jacques Offenbach.

answer: "{Mood Indigo}"

The main tune for this work was a theme song for Armond Piron's New Orleans Orchestra, and the tune was proposed to one of this piece's composers by Lorenzo Tio. As with "Stardust," Michael Parish claimed to have been the true lyricist even though Irving Mills took official credit. In this work's original recording, the composer swapped the usual registers of the clarinet and trombone to create a "mike-tone."

answer: The {Barque} of {Dante} or {Dante} and {Virgil} in {Hell}

In this painting, unmixed yellow and green pigments represent the length of the waterdrops, while red represents their shadows; Pierre Andrieu suggested that those water drops were inspired by the Nereids in The Landing of Marie de Medici. A figure with a head resembling that of Charles Le Brun's La Colere can be seen trying to clamber up, his arm almost touching the leg of a figure facing away from the viewer, who is nude but for a Persian blue cloth whipped up by the wind. A hint of white linen peaks out from one figure's robe, and that figure wears a laurel and remains calm, holding the hand of the physically unbalanced figure wearing a red cowl who stands to his left. A group of the damned struggle in the water, grasping at the title object, which holds on board the oarsman Phlegyas, the title figure, and his guide. For 10 points, name this painting which shows a scene from the Inferno, a work of Eugene Delacroix.

A sped-up recording of this technique as performed by the composer, his wife Betty, and Peter Mauzey appears in Vladimir Ussachevsky's Sonic Contours. Paul Lansky chopped up examples of this technique in several songs titled for an "idle" form of this, while Steve Reich's It's Gonna Rain features two nearly identical recordings of this going in and out of phase. A recording of this technique occurs after the A-test at the end of John Adams's Doctor Atomic, and a woman performs this technique in an aleatory fashion in the first knee play of Phillip Glass's Einstein on the Beach. Another Steve Reich work, Different Trains, features violins performing paradiddles and imitating the rhythms of this technique. Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait features a man performing this softly underneath the main strings and brass. The "sung", or "-stimme" version of this appears in works like Arnold Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire. For 10 points, name this type of sound composed of unmelodic phonemes.

One of the final moments in this film is set at the funeral of Mrs. Terrain who died from complications in her plastic surgery, which gradually made her decompose as she appears with an increasing number of bandages throughout the movie.

In one sequence from this movie the protagonist defeats a giant fire-breathing, teleporting samurai to save his beloved who is held in a giant cage and is played by the same actress who plays the truck driver Jill Layton.

Robert Schumann compared one of these pieces to "the song of a sleeping child," though its rhythms and nickname evoke the title insects in flight, and in one of these the right hand plays exclusively in pentatonic except for a single F natural. Charles A. Hoffman suggested adding an extra four bars to introduce the melody at the beginning of the longest of these, and Leopold Godowsky made a transcription of the first of these for one hand, while the last of these were not given an opus number and are thus called the "Three New" ones. Of the third of these, the composer stated that in all his life he had never been able to find such a beautiful melody. Besides "Winter Wind" and  "Tristesse," another of these was written in honor of the November Uprising in the composer's home country.  For 10 points, identify these piano exercises by a Polish Composer, the most famous of which is perhaps the "Revolutionary" one.

One of this man's symphonies features a fanfare with four blows described as 'knocking on the gates of heaven.' One of his piano sonatas was nicknamed Reliquie upon its posthumous publication, and he stated that 'the devil may play' his Wanderer Fantasy for piano. Like Ravel, he composed Valses nobles et sentimentales, and a singer hears 'the echo from the ravines' while standing on the highest cliff in one of his songs, which has clarinet obligato. One of his piano sonatas for four hands was later published as the 'Grand Duo.' He set Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Lady of the Lake' to music in 'Ellens dritter Gesang,' often mistitled as 'Ave Maria,' and his song 'Die Forelle' provided the theme for the fourth movement of a quintet which uses double bass instead of piano. For 10 points, name this prolific Austrian composer of lieder, whose other works include the quartet Death and the Maiden and the symphonies "Great" and "Unfinished."
