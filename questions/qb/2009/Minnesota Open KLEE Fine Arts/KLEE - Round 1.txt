answer: {Academic Festival Overture}

The large ensemble required for this piece was included over the protests of its commissioner, who asked that it be "not too uniformly thick." Bassoons are accompanied by off-beat cellos and violas in a section nicknamed "The Fox-Ride," while this work's opening is an adaptation of the Rakoczy march. It was originally commissioned by Bernard Scholz, and it sees legato violins in E major present material from "The Soverign.” It oncludes with a quotation of "Gautameaus igitur," while earlier, three trumpets introduce an adaptation of "Wir hatten gebauet ein stattliches Haus." Described as a "potpourri of drinking songs a la Suppé," for 10 points, identify this orchestral work written as a thank-you for an honorary doctorate from the University of Breslau, by Johannes Brahms.

Recently renovated buildings in this city include a building which was partially constructed on top of an older office building, the Paul Brown building; a former Shriners meeting hall, the Moolah Temple; and William B. Ittner's Art Deco Continental-Life Building, which lay vacant for over two decades.  One more notable landmark in this city is a red-brick-clad ten-story building named for a local brewing magnate, the first steel-frame skyscraper to feature its architect's trademark tripartite organization.  This home of Adler and Sullivan's Wainwright Building also features a structure containing a tram designed by Richard Bowser, whose legs are equilateral triangles and which features an observation deck at the peak of its catenary-shaped form.  For 10 points, name this Midwestern city whose Jefferson National Expansion Memorial notably houses Eero Saarinen's Gateway Arch.

answer: Woman Series

Critic Thomas Hess suggests that the blue-green pool depicted on the bottom of one of these works reveals that the piece is partially inspired by Rembrandt's A Woman Bathing in a Stream. The artist was convinced by art historian Meyer Schapiro to complete the first one of these works when he was on the brink of giving up. This group of works was partially inspired by cut-outs of smiling mouths from cigarette ads and one painting sometimes included in this series shows the central figure “with bicycle.” First exhibited at the Sidney Janis Gallery, this series' first two works show the main figure sitting down, while the last four depict the main character standing. The first painting in this series was over seven feet tall and startled viewers with the central figure's “bug-like” eyes and giant breasts. Inspired by ancient fertility idols, for 10 points, name this series of six abstract depictions of females, by Willem de Kooning.

answer: {Luigi Boccherini}

This man's brother produced the libretto Turno, re di Rutoli, which was never set to music, and one of his violin concertos was discovered to be a forgery of Henry Casadeus. The lighthearted character of his music led Giuseppe Puppo to deride this man as "Haydn's Wife," while one of his works features "Minuet of the Blind Beggars," and also depicts a garrison of soldiers signaling the midnight curfew in the "Ritirata" section; that work is the string quintet Night Music of the Streets of Madrid. His works were catalogued by Yves Gérard, and Friedrich Grützmacher arranged the most popular version of his Cello Concerto in B-flat Major. For 10 points, name this Italian composer and cellist who worked for Infante Luis Antonio of Spain, perhaps best remembered for the minuet from his String Quartet in E.

answer: {Giant Steps}

This album's third track opens with a drum solo by Art Taylor establishing a tense rhythm underlining the lack of melody for the first minutes in this song until Paul Chambers enters with the bassline. That track “Countdown” illustrates this album's lead musician's namesake “changes” based on major thirds. In addition to the tracks “Cousin Mary” and “Syeeda's Song Flute” this album's penultimate song heavily features the “sheets of sounds” effect and switches pianists from Tommy Flanagan to Wynton Kelly. This album features a ballad named for the leader's wife titled “Naima” and was completed two years before My Favorite Things. For 10 points, name this 1959 jazz album by John Coltrane.

Under the pseudonym Flor O'Squarr, one critic compared this painting to a Chinese princess in a Heine poem whose "greatest pleasure in life was to tear up satin and silk." In a Picasso painting of the same name, a woman wearing a green hat with a yellow flower whispers while a woman with a sky blue cap smiles at nothing in particular. Georges Rivière propagated the idea that this painting was done entirely from memory, and at this painting's far left a woman in a sapphire dress turns away from a man in a black suit. A woman in a blue-and-yellow striped dress is Estelle, the sister of the artist's model Jeanne Samary, and at the right of the forefront a man writing with a pen sits next to a man with a toothpick. At left the Cuban painter Cardenas is seen wearing a bowler hat and dancing with the model Margot. For 10 points, name this painting of a bunch of people dancing in Montmartre, a work of Pierre-Auguste Renoir.

answer: {Sir Michael Tippett}

In one opera by this man, Mangus tries to stage The Tempest, and Schubert's "Die Larbe Farce" is sung by Flora, the ward of Faber. He employed glossolalia to convey the sense of eternity in The Vision of St. Augustine, while the title location "sings itself to sleep" after its song "leaves the sky" in The Rose Lake . He described his fourth symphony, which is in one movement, as a "birth-to-death" piece, and besides The Knot Garden, he also composed a Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli for string orchestra. T.S. Eliot declined to write the libretto for a choral work which utilizes African American spirituals in its description of the killing of a Nazi official, and in one of his operas, two characters are transfigured into gods while King Fisher dies before he can fire his pistol, allowing Mark and Jenifer to perform the title ceremony. For 10 points, name this composer of the oratorio A Child of Our Time and the opera The Midsummer Marriage.

answer: The {Ghosts} of {Versailles}

A baritone in this opera claims he has been everything from an “egalitarian” to a “heathen comedian” in his aria “Diplomat, acrobat / teacher of etiquette,” which he sings after first entering being chased by a mob of creditors. At the end of the first act the entrance of the exotic singer Samira interrupts the villain's plot to catch one character illegally selling the Queen's diamond necklace during a party at the Turkish embassy. The plot of the opera was partially based on the play The Guilty Mother and one character promises to marry his daughter Florestine to the treacherous Begearss. This opera was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera to celebrate its 100th anniversary and in the second act Figaro helps release the Almavivas from a Revolutionary jail allowing them to escape to America. At the beginning of this opera the playwright Beaumarchais tells Marie Antoinette that he can change history preventing her execution through his new opera “A Figaro for Antonia.” For 10 points, name this opera by John Corigliano titled for specters inhabiting a palace after the French Revolution.

answer: {Harold en Italie} or {Harold} in {Italy}

In his eminently amusing essay on this work, Donald Tovey calls its composer "the whitest liar since Cyrano de Bergerac" and catalogues the various differences between this work and its source material. Its composer stated that convent bells in this work are "suggested by two harp-notes doubled by the flutes, oboes and horns", and in the scherzo, the oboe and piccolo represent pifferi. It used material from its composer's unfinished Rob Roy, while the composer used the money given to him for his later Romeo et Juliette. It features movements like "Serenade of an Abruzzi mountaineer to his mistress" and "March of the pilgrims singing their evening prayer." This work ends with an "Orgy of the Brigands", and Paganini objected to this work because he did not get enough time playing the viola, though the viola does represent the title character. For 10 points, name this symphony by Hector Berlioz, based on a work of Lord Byron.

answer: {Robert Campin} (accept {Master} of {Flemalle} before mentioned)

In one of this artist's works an angel holds a banner over a paralyzed midwife with a Latin inscription translating “touch the child and you shall be healed.” This artist's version of The Marriage of the Virgin depicts the titular wedding occurring in front of the church of Notre-Dame-du-Sablon. He depicted St. Barbara sitting on a red plush bench while the tower where she was imprisoned is seen through a window on the right side of an altarpiece whose center panel is lost, and which is named for a Cologne theologian. In addition to the Seilern Triptych and the Werl Altarpiece, he featured a decrepit barn in his Nativity, which combines the main Nativity story with depictions of the adoration of the shepherds and the legend of the midwives. In his best known work a hanging bronze laver appears in the back and the Virgin sits next to a sixteen sided table representing the Hebrew prophets, while she is being visited by the angel Gabriel. On the right panel of that work this artist put a saw-like sword at the feet of Joseph who is using a screwdriver to make a mousetrap with which he plans to trap the Devil.  For 10 points, name this teacher of Rogier van der Weyden who is identified with the Master of Flemalle and painted the Merode Altarpiece.

answer: Music For {Strings}, {Percussion}, and {Celesta}

The diatonicism of this work's second movement is an example of what its composer called an "extension in range", and the final movement opens with a two-note tympani motif and strummed chords in the violins, violas, and cellos.  The first movement of this work, Andante tranquillo, uses the golden section to determine the placement of its climax; it is a chromatic fugue centered on A, which features twelve entries all the way around the circle of fifths.  The other slow section of this four-movement work is the third movement, which opens with a xylophone solo and is in its composer's characteristic "night music" style.  An imperfect translation of this composition's title falsely implies that this work does not include a part for piano, which plays a non-concertante role; and one of its titular instrumental sections is arranged in two antiphonal groups. For 10 points, identify this work by Bela Bartok named for its orchestration, which lacks winds and brass.

This man has called George Rochberg his "paradigmatic postmodernist" and claimed that Bill Clinton's "participatory investment in music [was] higher than anyone's passive consumption of the classics" in a notable New Republic book review, though Susan McClary has criticized a recent project of his for ignoring African-American traditions such as jazz and hip-hop.  He criticized the "museum ideology" in a work asserting that the brisk tempos of quote-unquote "authentic" early music ensembles instead reflect modern tastes and preferences; and another work probed beyond the mythologizing of Robert Craft to reveal the extent to which his most famous subject used folk idioms and extolled "splendid, healthy barbarism" in a "biography of the works through Marva".  For 10 points, name this professor at UC-Berkeley, author of Text and Act, Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions, and the Oxford History of Western Music.

answer: Alexander {Scriabin}

This man referred to one of his works as "Chattering strings", which joined Danse Languide in one collection, while another is marked Bruscamente irato. One of his works features a climax in the Prestissimo Volando movement and he compared one of his works to insects because they are "the kisses of the sun." He refused to publicly perform one of his works, which featured markings of "surge of terror", and another work was divided into sections such as "His soul in the orgy of love." The sixth movement of his first symphony has a mezzo soprano singing "O highest symbol of divinity, supreme art and harmony", while the third follows the movement "Delights" with "Divine Play." Inversions of his mystic chord dominate one of his works, and this composer of the Poem of Ecstacy and The Divine Poem never finished his slightly insane Mysterium. For 10 points, name this Russian composer of Prometheus, Poem of Fire.

answer: Portrait of the {Family} of {Carlos IV} (or Portrait of the {Family} of {Charles IV} or La {familia} de {Carlos IV})

The title figure in this work stands next to a child dressed in red, while the position of a man to the extreme left in this painting, as well as the beady, pinkish eyes of the title personage, suggest the figures may be looking at a giant mirror.  Some critics have linked the depiction of Lot and His Daughters in this work to the central figure, perhaps the progeny of an affair with Godoy.  On the left of this work, the face of an old woman can be seen in front of a dark painting on the wall, while the woman standing to her left, perhaps because of her excessive ugliness, has her face turned away from the viewer.  In the center of this work stands Francisco de Paula Antonio, while to the left is Crown Prince Fernando.  Like Las Meninas, the artist himself can be seen behind a giant canvas in the back left of this work.  Painted in 1800, for 10 points, name this group portrait of a Spanish monarch and his relatives by Francisco Goya.

answer: {Thomas Tallis}

This composer's organ interludes include two Felix namques. He wrote a remarkably long antiphon adhering to the Phrygian mode, unusually for the time period; that work was later made into a 5-part mass of the same name, Salve intemerata. In one of his motets, the two sopranos sing the same line half a bar apart, while four of the other five voices sing the same melody, two inverted, at different tempos. That work, Miserere nostri, was the last of a set of 34 motets created with a younger colleague, the Cantiones sacrae, and that colleague wrote Ye Sacred Muses to commemorate this man's death. He set two Lamentations of Jeremiah to a 5-part male chorus, and composed a 40-person motet, Spem in alium. For 10 points, name this early British composer, one of whose themes was used for a fantasia by Ralph Vaughan Williams.

answer: {Appalachian Spring}

The composer's score for this work included the stage instructions that light shine on one character's face on the first note louder than mezzo piano, and its first section contains a rising three-note motive and telescoping simple triads. The music for this piece was composed from three scripts, the latter two just called Name and being revisions of the first, "House of Victory". The suite based on this work omitted parts including "Fear in the Night" and a section containing a "Harper's Ferry" solo, "Day of Wrath". Including characters like the Husbandman, the Bride, and the Pioneer Woman, the last of whom ends this work by saying "In the Beginning God Created the Heaven and the Earth" in a section entitled "The Lord's Day". It takes its name from a poem by Hart Crane which has little else to do with this work, which is about a celebration of pioneers in Pennsylvania upon building a farm house. Originally titled Ballet for Martha, for 10 points, name this ballet that includes the Shaker hymn "Simple Gifts," written for Martha Graham by Aaron Copland.

Minor works in this movement include two dolls imitating eighteenth century pedagogical tools and a limp figure sitting on an office chair; those are Phantom Twins and Pauline Bunny, by Christine Borland and Sarah Lucas. One artist in this movement depicted the African title character surrounded by images of buttocks with a breast made out of elephant dung, The Holy Virgin Mary. That artist, who also put thirteen paintings of macaques in The Upper Room, is Chris Ofili. A work by one of its main artists was worked into a performance piece by Cai Yuan and Xi Jianjun, who jumped around on it while it was on display. The artist of that work also made a tent whose walls displayed names like Billy Childish and other past sexual and non-sexual partners. Besides the creator of My Bed and Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995, the leader of this group created a diamond-encrusted skull called For the Love of God and a shark preserved in formaldehyde, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living.

Contemporary critics admired this artist's work where an angel can be seen descending into a desolate landscape as Ishmael lays ill next to his grieving mother.  A man almost completely in shadows looks on as four figures flee from the titular city in his The Burning of Sodom, while a nude lies on the grass by the shore in his Bacchante by the Sea. His later works such as The Ferryman and Fishing with Net, Evening were characterized by a few figures in a watery environment surrounded by lush canopy, while he depicted the commune where he lived in the Ville d'Avray. His most famous work, executed as a sketch on paper, shows a river running between two cliffs as the early morning light reflects off the titular Roman ruins.  The artist of Hagar in the Wilderness, for 10 points, name this French landscape painter of The Bridge at Narni.
