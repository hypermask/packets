answer: the {Clarinet Concerto} (prompt for {Mozart} before his name is read)

One performer of this work argued that it "must not be the victim of technique... rather the legato aspects of the work... should receive emphasis." Franz Giegling's 1977 edition of this work with the NMA ushered in changes in its performance, which gradually grew to replace Robert Marcellus' canonical recording of the work with the Cleveland orchestra. Although it contains no cadenza, it does feature three held-out dominant chords which may permit an eingang, and performers have frequently ordered larger instruments to play the low Cs in this work. Like the composer's quintet featuring the same instrument, this work was written for Anton Stadler, and the first movement of this work was originally intended for basset horn and orchestra. For 10 points, name this A major showpiece for a woodwind instrument by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

answer: {Bacchus} and {Ariadne}

Warren Tresidder disputes Panofsky's claim that the depiction of two animals in this painting was meant to signify that one figure had just returned, arguing the representation of those two animals was caused by Demetrius Moscus' mistranslation of Philostratus the Elder's Imagines.

One figure in this painting has the Corona Borealis constellation appearing above her head representing a symbolic crown of stars, while in the foreground a King Charles spaniel barks at a satyr who drags a severed donkey's head with a string. This work was commissioned for the Alabaster Chamber by Duke Alfonso d'Este as the second in a series of mythological paintings whose other members include The Worship of Venus and The Bacchanal of the Andrians.

Known in jazz music as the diminished scale, for 10 points, identify this scale which alternates whole steps and half steps, and is so named for its eight distinct notes.

answer: {Three Studies} for Figures at the {Base} of a {Crucifixion}
