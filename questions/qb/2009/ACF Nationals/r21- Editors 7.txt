answer: {murder} of {Thomas} à {Becket} [accept equivalents mentioning {Becket}; prompt on {Murder} in the {Cathedral} for {Becket}]

According to one account, the men involved in this incident ate food from the same dish as the dogs, who then refused to eat from that dish. The family of one of the men involved was said to be cursed to always have either too much or too little water, and a legend about another of the men involved claims that he founded the McMahon family in Ireland. Edward Grim was wounded during this incident. Its target had opposed the marriage of the Count of Poitou to Isabel de Warenne, which may have led Richard Brito to participate in it. After learning that the Scottish king favored hanging them, the perpetrators took shelter at Knaresborough before surrendering and performing penance at Black Mountain. This event was inspired by an off-the-cuff remark asking for “someone to rid me of this pesky priest,” which Brito, William de Tracy, Hugh de Moreville, and Reginald Fitzurse took seriously. For 10 points, name this event in which four Norman knights supposed that Henry II wanted a certain Archbishop of Canterbury dead.

answer: The {Common} Law

It takes issue with the ideas of Karl von Savigny and his fixation on Roman antecedents. It cites Julien Lehuerou on the importance of proceeding theoretically and quotes Hankford at length on the responsibilities of bailors. One of this work's key themes is the relationship between form and substance, illustrated in its discussion of the Peerless case. Although it adopted the same historical approach as an earlier work by Henry Summer Maine, it originated from a series of twelve lectures its author prepared for the Lowell Institute, and was probably inspired after a reading of C.C. Langdell's work on Contracts. Including such notable sections as "Successions," "Early Forms of Liability," and "Trespass and Negligence," it famously begins by asserting, “The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.” For 10 points, identify this 1881 work named for the body of principles and rules that originates not from the legislature, but from judicial decisions, the masterpiece of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.

answer: {BMPs} [or bone {morphogenetic} proteins; or {osteogenic} proteins; or {OPs}]

Samuel Murray has hypothesized that the first-discovered member of this class of molecules was actually a fragment of spp-24 that binds to them. Mesenchymal cells of the septum transversum use one of these molecules as a signal to induce albumin expression in the endoderm of the liver. Interaction between type I and type II receptors of this class of molecules can lead to the initiation of transcription of R-Smads, and juvenile polyposis can be mimicked through overexpression of noggin, an inhibitor of them. They were first discovered by Marshall Urist, and a gradient in them regulates the expression of Msx, a protein necessary for the specification of the neural crest. For 10 points, name this class of proteins named for their ability to induce formation of new bone tissue.

answer: “The {Killers}”

At one point in this story, one character tells another that he has a lot of luck and that he “ought to play the races.” That exchange is followed by another character visiting Hirsch's rooming house where that character encounters a man lying on a bed “with all his clothes on.” Later, another figure speculates that the man lying in the bed must have been mixed up with something in Chicago. The first scene is set at a location with a long mirror that runs along the counter and had once been a bar. It opens with a man ordering a roast pork tenderloin with applesauce, at which point he is told that he can't have said item until dinner. After this response, the workers, including Sam, the black cook, are harassed by two identically dressed men in suits named Max and Al, who turn out to be the title figures. It ends with George, the proprietor of Henry's Lunch Room, discussing the fate of an old Swedish boxer with its young protagonist, who is also featured in such stories as “Cross Country Snow” and “Big Two Hearted River.” For 10 points, identify this Nick Adams tale, a work about the impending murder of Ole Andreson by Ernest Hemingway.

answer: The {Tet Offensive}

One portion of this event was witnessed by reporters at the Caravelle Hotel, who were caught in fighting over a racetrack. Successful deception about the intent of this action led the targets to launch Operation Checkers and Operation Niagara. The victors in this action were directed by the Chairman of the Central Office because that group's top general was hiding out in Hungary in fear of political reprisals for his accused role in the Anti-Party Affair. It began with diversionary attacks on small towns and a siege of a Marine base, and ultimately included attacks on sixty-four district capitals. As a result of this event, the former Imperial seat at Hue was occupied for three weeks, which came as a surprise due to incorrect predictions by William Westmoreland. Walter Cronkite's reporting on this action heavily influenced Lyndon Johnson's decision not to run for re-election. For 10 points, name this series of 1968 Viet Cong attacks which began on the Vietnamese lunar new year.

In one of them, the speaker asks that the paper he composes upon be blessed, while another describes the fatality of the butterfly. They include a characterization of the world as “changing and arrogant” and a plea to the stars for the return of the gone day. Another reflects that it has been seventeen years since the speaker has “burned with fire.” Often published alongside two of its author's letters, The Ascent of Mount Ventoux and The Letter to Posterity, one of them, “If it's not love, then what is that I feel,” was adapted for Troilus and Criseyde by Chaucer. Originally given the name Rerum vulgarium fragmenta, they were championed by Pietro Bembo and subsequent editors divided them into two sections: poems composed during their primary subject's life and poems composed after her death. Including such poems as, “Oh God! That lovely face, that Gentle Look,” and, “Diana never pleased her lover more,” its author completed 366 of these poems in all, with 317 of them written in his namesake sonnet style.

answer: {isotope} effects

One of these phenomena occurs during the manganese-catalyzed decarboxylation of oxaloacetate, but not in the enzyme-catalyzed version. The Bartell model of the “molar volume” one of them is only applicable to liquids near their melting point, and another type of them can be described by the Gross-Butler equation. Wolfsberg revised the Bigeleisen-Mayer equation, which governs these phenomena, to account for anharmonicity. Dependence of a reaction rate on this kind of effect is known as the “kinetic” variety, and can be used to probe mechanisms of enzyme function. For 10 points, name these effects caused by the substitution of one atom with another atom of equivalent atomic number and different atomic mass.

An alternative version of this operation was conceived by and named for Percy Daniell, while Fatou's lemma states that this operation on a limit approaching infinity is less than or equal to the limit approaching infinity of this operation. This operator's namesake proved the dominated convergence theorem, which establishes conditions for which pointwise convergence commutes with this operation. The monotone convergence theorem does not work on this operation's predecessor, and that namesake's eponymous measure provides the grounding with which a function is integrated. For 10 points, name this type of integration, a generalization of the Riemann integral named for a Frenchman.

answer: The {Revenger's Tragedy}

This play features an oath sworn on a sword right before one of its main characters tries to procure his own sister, Gratiana. One of its characters rationalizes his actions by noting that a “bastard by nature should make cuckolds / because he is the son of a cuckold maker.” That figure, Spurio, allows himself to be seduced by his step-mother, whose real son is charged with the rape of the virtuous Lord Antonio's wife in the first Act. The two protagonists spend much of this play disguised as men named Carlo and Piato, and in one notable scene a character is killed after kissing a poisoned skeleton. Its sources include Heliodorus' Aethiopian History, which features a similar scene to the one where Lussurioso bursts in on his father in bed, as well as Seneca's bloody Thyestes. It opens with the protagonist telling of his mistress' murder at the hands of the Duke as he cradles her skull and vows to get even.
