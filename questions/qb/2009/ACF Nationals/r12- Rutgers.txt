answer: {Lord George Gordon}

This man resigned from the navy after being refused a promotion by the Earl of Sandwich and ultimately died in Newgate after being convicted of libeling Marie Antoinette. Baron Erskine's defense of this man brought an end to the doctrine of "constructive treason," and this man was successfully opposed by liberal arts college namesake Jeffrey Amherst in his most notable action. Johann Ramberg's cartoon Moses Choosing His Cook satirized this man's late-in-life conversion to Judaism. His supporters were shot at by troops stationed outside the Bank of England under the command of John Wilkes, discrediting that figure. Five hundred died during the week-long assault on the houses of Parliament led by this man's Protestant Association, which used the slogan "No Popery" in protest of the Catholic Relief Act. For 10 points, name this British agitator who led some namesake 1780 riots in London.

answer: {Persian} [or {Farsi}]

One collection of poetry in this language states that “one grain of rice will make up each man's measure” and describes an unjust king's arrival to a shrine where the prophet John's body is contained. This language was used to write the book Advantages of Silence by the author ofThe Rose Garden. In a narrative poem written in this language, a stepson uses the trial by fire to escape from the lust of his stepmother. Another poet in this language wrote "Our Death is our Wedding" and "A Star Without a Name," composed the epic Spiritual Couplets, and popularized the ghazal form. Landmarks in this language's medieval corpus include theDiwan by Sa'di. For 10 points, name this language used by Rumi, as well as by Ferdowsi for the Shah Nameh and an author who wrote about "a loaf of bread" and "a jug of wine" in the Rubiyat.

answer: {Paolo Veronese} [accept {Paolo Caliari}]

This artist's later work included a series of seven allegorical female figures, including Temperance Triumphing Over Vice and Charity, all of which were drawn in brown ink on gray paper. This artist's Lamentation depicts a foreshortened, seated Christ being held by a man in red. In another work by this man, a putti tries to steady a large gray horse as a fully clothed Mars tries to resist a nude Venus' advances. Even though he worked with Palladio on a commission by the Barbaro family to fresco the Villa Maser, his greatest commissions were executed in Venice and include Age and Youth, for the ducal palace, and a pair of large banquet scenes. One of those scenes depicts Christ in Galilee at a wedding, while the other was produced for the monastery of Santi Giovanni, but resulted in a charge of heresy. For 10 points, identify this painter of Marriage at Cana and Feast in the House of Levi.

Nugent et al. protected these compounds with tert-butoxycarbonyl in a variant of the Henry reaction representing one of the first known chiral proton catalysis reactions discovered outside of proteins. They produce ketenes in the Wolff rearrangement, then react with those ketenes in the Staudinger cycloaddition. Both alkenes and tertiary alcohols yield a product that can rearrange to form them in the Schmidt reaction. Any reaction that uses them is denoted by the prefix “aza.” Their namesake functional group is attacked by a cyanide ion in the Strecker synthesis of amino acids, and they are produced intramolecularly via the reduction of azides. Reacting carbonyl compounds with primary amines gives derivatives of these compounds known as Schiff bases. For 10 points, name these compounds characterized by the presence of a carbon-nitrogen double bond.

answer: John {Wayne} [or Marion {Morrison}]

In one song by a band of this name, the singer states that he “had to jerk off the dog just to feed the goddamned cat.” The best-known song by that band is “Texas Funeral”, which appeared in From Dusk till Dawn. A film directed by Demetrios Estdelanecropolis tells of a young girl, Shirley Pimple, who battles against a “Temple of Doom” named for another person by this name. This man's ghost appears to advise the title character in the Garth Ennis comic Preacher, and he lent his name to a can opener and became an early spokesman for the American Cancer Society after having a lung removed. That actor is also cited among the casualties of suspected radiation poisoning tied to his role as Genghis Khan in The Conqueror. For 10 points, identify this portrayer of Hondo Lane, McClintock, and Rooster Cogburn, an icon of American Westerns.

answer: {Graves}' Disease [accept {Basedow's Disease} until read

This disease causes fibroblasts containing IGF-1 receptors to express IL-16 and RANTES in the presence of Immunoglobulin G, and roughly three percent of sufferers also exhibit the related Marine-Lenhart syndrome. CTAL-4 and HLA are two genes known to be associated with this disease, and it is associated with an increase in estrogen receptor expression, possibly explaining why it occurs in seven times as many females as males. Patients exhibit the “Merseburg triad,” named after the town in which Carl von Basedow first described it, and in some parts of Europe this disease is known by his name. That triad includes heart palpitations, exophthalmos, or protruding eyes, and goiter. For 10 points, name this disease named after an Irish doctor, an autoimmune form of hyperthyroidism.

answer: {Letters} to the {Corinthians} or the {Corinthians}

They touch upon the hospitality of Rahab and discuss the impossibility of serving both God and Mammon. One of them includes a discussion of the Phoenix myth before it segues into the omniscience of God and the hope of Resurrection. That discussion is preceded by a reference to Job and the example of a vast sea being withheld by God's Will. Although Johann Hug argued that the strident tone of the last four chapters in these works marks that section as the work of another author, that section's defense of the author's life as an apostle, which included trips to Salonnica with Silas, is biographically accurate. The longer one is best known for Chapter 49's statement that there is “nothing base or arrogant” in love, and that love “bears all things,” and was probably written while the author was in Ephesus in AD 56. For ten points identify this pair of Epistles written by Paul to a church in the namesake Greek city.

answer: {Estonia} [or {Eesti Varbariik}]

Shortly after this nation achieved independence, Sir Stephen Tallents settled the border with its southern neighbor, dividing the city of Valga. A major foreign policy concern for this country is reacquiring the former Petseri County, which had been granted to this country in a 1920 treaty. Friedrich Kreutzwald was the first to document the Setu people found in its Voru County, and on this country's eastern coast and islands, the Rannarootslased, ethnic Swedes, form a small minority. With important ports like Sillamae, Ida-Viru County is this country's chief industrial area, though more economically and environmentally important are the facilities and power plants associated with this nation's oil shale reserves near the city of Narva. The home of the city of Tartu, it is located to the west of the Leningrad Oblast and to the north of Latvia. For 10 points, name this Baltic republic, whose economic hub is the capital Tallinn.

During their production, two different spin states must be trapped in the f = 9/2 hyperfine ground state. The experiment that created them used Feshbach resonances to prevent molecules from forming instead of the intended result, and further experiments by Chin et al. on Lithium-6 strongly imply that they have superfluid properties. First created by Jin, Greiner, and Regal using 400,000 potassium-40 atoms, this substance must be created using Cooper pairs, since the Pauli exclusion principle does not allow its constituents to occupy the same quantum state. For 10 points, name this state of matter that roughly corresponds to Bose-Einstein condensate for particles with half-integer spin.

Louis Smirnow blames the “Christian world” which “said naught” in a poem named for Christendom's version of this “bloody” figure. An anti-war poem in The White Messenger and Other Poems by Edith Matilda Thomas was named for the “altar” of this figure, and a poem describing the outrage that the author felt concerning the return of a runaway slave toward the state of Massachusetts is named for this figure “in State Street” and was written by John Greenleaf Whittier. The son of a slave, along with many other children, are offered to this figure in a novel which ends with the offering of the heart of Matho to this god, that work being Flaubert's Salammbo. “Besmeared with blood/ of human sacrifices,” this demon gives a speech demanding war with God in Paradise Lost. For 10 points, name this demon who appears prominently in Allen Ginsburg's Howl as a representative of the American city.

A letter of Joseph Jones told this man to be on the lookout for "dangerous combinations" and "sinister practices," and the Louis Nicola letter to this man proposed that he proclaim himself dictator. This man quashed a conspiracy instigated by Christopher Richmond and John Armstrong. The goal of that movement was to illicitly use this man's prestige to gain the power to tax imports. When this man denounced that attempt of Alexander McDougall and Walter Stewart, known as the Newburgh Conspiracy, he took out glasses and stated that he had grown both gray and blind. This man was also targeted by the inspector general of the army, who was miffed that this figure had not granted a promotion to major general, and sought to replace this man with Horatio Gates.

answer: {gender} [prompt on {noun class} or {phi characteristic}]

Tucker, Lambert, and Rigault tested French speakers' skill with this construct, which a 2007 study by Dalila Ayoun showed was being lost from that language. The Lak word for “house” is the only word in that language that expresses the inquorate form of this construct, which is fairly common in Tsova-Tush. That language differentiates between eight types of this construct, as does Swahili, which marks this construct by prefixing every word in the clause related to the noun which carries it, even the verb. Although this construct is generally arbitrary in Indo-European languages, Dyirbal uses this to distinguish between “things related to fire” and “non-flesh food”, and many languages, such as Ojibwe, use it to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects. Often marked by articles like French la and le, or case endings like Latin -us, -a, and -um, for 10 points, what is this noun characteristic, most commonly seen as “masculine”, “feminine”, and “neuter”?

A rotational period of 1.08 earth days for this object was determined using Lomb-Scargle periodograms and measurements by the Swift satellite in the B-band frequency. Methane ice in the atmosphere most likely covers up the deposits of red tholins on this object, leading to its high albedo, second only to Enceladus in the solar system. It lies 44 degrees off the ecliptic, a fact that places it in the scattered disc region and explains its late discovery by Brown, Trujillo, and Rabinowitz. Originally known as UB313, Xena, or Lila, its satellite was jokingly called Gabrielle, but is now known as Dysnomia. The most distant non-comet object in the solar system, for 10 points, identify this object whose 2005 discovery led to the classification of both it and Pluto as "dwarf planets", which is named for the Greek goddess of strife.

A stone statue of King Idrimi relates how Idrimi became a vassal of this polity after returning to the throne of Alalakh. This polity was given control of Alalakh by a neighboring power in exchange for relinquishing its coastal claims. Based on terms in the Kikkuli horse-training manual, the names of several rulers, and a list of deities found in a treaty, the rulers of this polity are argued to have been Indo-Europeans. Princesses of this polity include Gilu-Kheba and Tadu-Kheba and were used in marriage alliances between it and Egypt, and the murder of one ruler of this kingdom by his own son Kurtiwaza and others was regarded by Amartana of the “Khurri Land” as a sign of Teshub's judgment that Tushratta was a usurper. Tushratta had overseen the destruction of this kingdom and the sack of its capital at the hands of the Hittite king Shuppiluliumash. For 10 points, identify this empire that ruled from the capital Washshukanni, held northern Syria and Mesopotamia, and was populated by ethnic Hurrians.

One character in this play recommends a glass of schnapps with a pinch of powder for the main character's insomniac notion that the walls are speaking, as both occupy the same bed. At this work's beginning, that character is cutting canes in the undergrowth with Andres when he notices a part of the grass where a decapitated head once resembled a hedgehog. A pooping horse rendered the remark to “be natural,” but his doctor, who is angry at him for the natural act of pissing against a wall, asks him to do it in a bottle to evaluate his diet of peas. Later, the protagonist notices “The moon's like a bloody knife!” as he stands in a pool of water. For 10 points, after discovering an affair with the Drum Major, the title character murders his wife Marie in what posthumously performed and fragmented play by Georg Büchner?

This thinker compiled a didactic set of essays on education and religion originally attributed to Lady Mary Wray. That work, The Ladies Library, preceded a piece on Mt. Vesuvius and a work with a Latin title analyzing the nature of motion. He expressed an interest in monetary reform in The Querist and in another essay penned the line, “Westward the course of empire takes its way.”In addition to criticizing the theory of fluxions, he argued against Malebranche's representationalist theories by positing that because we perceive objects, but can only immediately perceive ideas, it is virtually impossible for an object to exist outside of the mind. That idea, now known as “the master argument,” was elaborated upon in a work written “in opposition to Skeptics and Atheists,” as a supplement to his 1710 work Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge.

This molecule's receptor, which is degraded by PCSK9, contains three EGF-like domains sandwiched around a beta-propeller domain. The gene for that receptor is activated by the bHLH fragment of SREBP. Endocytosis of this molecule can induce macrophages to become foam cells. ASPs can inhibit a reaction in which copper ions oxidize this molecule; an important step in that reaction is the modification of apoprotein B-100.

One structure at this site features Giovanni Sogliani's Madonna on the left hand side of the pier, offset by Andrea del Sarto's St. Agnes on the right hand side. That building's bronze doors were rebuilt in Giambologna's workshop after a fire gutted much of the complex in 1595. Rainaldo built the façade, thus continuing the work of the original architect, Buschetto. Visitors usually enter the site through the Bonnanus designed Porta di San Ranieri, which opens onto the courtyard and a more well known structure. A pair of lions, accompanied by statues of Michael and Hercules, supports the columns of the main building's large ornate pulpit, which was designed by Giovanni Pisano. It also features a 16th century bronze lamp that was said to have inspired some well known experiments at this site by Galileo. For 10 points, identify this cathedral in the Piazza dei Miracoli, best known for its campanile, a famed Leaning Tower.
