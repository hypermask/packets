answer: “A {Far Cry} from {Africa}”

Gerald Guinness accused this of being an "unlikable poem" which uses the word "batten" when it should use "cause" and engages in phrases such as "colonel of carrion" for "reasons rather of sound than sense." This poem describes “brutish necessity” wiping its hands “upon the napkin of a dirty cause.” A worm in this poem urges no waste of compassion on “separate dead.” Its speaker claims that “statistics justify and scholars seize” policies that lead to a child being hacked in bed. Addressing similar themes as the author's "Ruins of a Great House," the speaker of this poem contrasts “a white dust of ibises” with men who “Dance to the tightened carcass of a drum.”This poem's central conflict is compared to “The gorilla wrestling with the superman,” and the speaker wonders how to choose between the title place and “the English tongue I love.” The speaker wonders how he can “face such slaughter and be cool” before questioning “How can I turn from" the title place "and live?” For 10 points, name this poem about a continent by Derek Walcott.

answer: {stellar wind} [accept {solar wind}]

This phenomenon can broaden the P Cygni line profile of objects in its “line-driven” version. This phenomenon's involvement causes a warped magnetic field known as the Parker spiral. This phenomenon can cause a namesake “bubble” in systems like Eta Carina.In some binary systems, this phenomenon can interact with itself to form a pinwheel nebula. A very strong form of this phenomenon characterizes Wolf-Rayet stars, and occurs when stars exceed the Eddington limit. In the solar system, this phenomenon interacts with a planet's magnetosphere to produce the “bow shock,” and the boundary where it slows to sub-sonic speeds is known as the termination shock. For 10 points, name this phenomenon, a plasma stream ejected from stars.

answer: {Franck}-{Hertz} experiment

The setup for this experiment was improved by using platinum wire wound on a pyrex glass support to reduce the amount of metal, and that version was performed by Goucher and Davis. An apparatus named for its performers requires a precise temperature-pressure environment to avoid changing the mean-free path of electrons. The sudden drops in voltages at multiples of 4.9 volts allowed its performers to come to its conclusion. Its setup used a tube containing an anode, a cathode, and a counter electrode whose potential relative to the other electrodes was negative, and the inelastic collisions between the accelerated electrons and the electrons in the mercury vapor was observed in this experiment. For 10 points, identify this experiment which demonstrated the idea of energy quantization and was performed by two German physicists.

answer: The Red {River} War

The U.S.'s abrogation of the treaty signed prior to this conflict was held constitutional because of Congress's “plenary power” in the case Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock. One party in this conflict had earlier been defeated at the battles of Beecher Island and was known as the “Dog Soldiers.” One combatant in this war, Billy Dixon, is one of six civilians to earn the Medal of Honor, and sniped a man at 1500 yards in “the shot of the century” during a battle in this conflict instigated by Quanah Parker and Coyote Dung, the second battle of Adobe Wells. This war was spurred by the abrogation of the Medicine Lodge Treaty, and ended when Red Warbonnet was routed by Ranald Mackenzie at Palo Duro Canyon. For 10 points, name this 1874 war to remove the Arapahoe, Cheyenne, Comanche, and Kiowa from the southern plains, named for the border waterway between Texas and Oklahoma.

answer: {Debye}-{Hückel equation/theory}

An approximation of it named for Russell uses the TDS value to determine one of its parameters via the Langelier approximation, while one constant that appears in it has units of moles per kilogram to the one half power, according the Bates-Guggenheim convention. Along with Guggenheim, Scatchard and Bronsted improved upon this model by developing the SIT theory, and that model has a better fit than a modification of it named for Davies. This relationship assumes the existence of only long-range interactions, and it was extended to account for Brownian motion by Lars Onsager. It assumes that the solvent is structure-less and that the solution is dilute, and the theory behind it implies that the electrostatic potential falls off exponentially when r is greater than the atomic radius due to screening by counter ions. For 10 points, identify this equation which is used to calculate the activity coefficients, and is named for a German and a Dutch scientist.

answer: {Prison Notebooks}

The second volume of them features a discussion of the “latinity” of Central and South America, as well as a consideration of St. Benedict's influence on feudalism. Another analyzes the story of an animal who tears off his own testicles in order to save his life. That piece, “The Fable of the Beaver,” is contained in the same section as its discussion of “Agitation and Propaganda,” where their author focuses on the rise of dictatorships through the party system. Including other pieces like “An Introduction to the Study of Grammar” and “Americanism and Fordism,” they are broadly divided into three major sections including “The Philosophy of Praxis.” Their composition over the course of six years was precipitated by the passage of a series of “Exceptional Laws.” Notable for a piece that uses Marx to explicate Machiavelli and another that discusses the development of “cultural hegemony,” for 10 points, identify this collection of short essays, named for the disciplinary setting in which they were written, the masterpiece of Antonio Gramsci.

An opera named for this work's composer claims that this work was inspired by angels and written in one night shortly after the death of its composer's wife Lukrezia. That opera by Hans Pfitzner sees this work recovered by its composer's pupil Silla and his son Ighino. Its composer structured the longer movements homophonically and deployed a slow contrapuntal technique. This work, which was first played at Cardinal Vitellozzi's home, included a dedication letter detailing its composer's “novo modorum genere”, or “new stylistic approach." Its last section is scored for a countertenor and a treble rather than a tenor, and that section, the Agnus Dei, is in two parts rather than three. Its Kyrie and Sanctus were written to show that imitation didn't have to obscure the content of the words and was presented to the Council of Trent. For 10 points, identify this work sometimes credited with saving polyphonic music, a mass dedicated to and named for a particular pope, which was composed by Giovanni Palestrina.

This work's description of mutability, “a shadow of a cloud on the stream,” is contrasted with the steadfastness of the stone, which also becomes a heart in a subsequent stanza. In another section, the narrator recalls the sweetness and sensitive nature of a poet, and even agrees to sing the praises of a man he once thought of as a “vainglorious lout.” It alludes to Gertrude's suffering with the lines “That is heavens part,” while at the beginning the speaker recalls exchanging “polite meaningless words” with such figures as Countess Markiewicz and a man briefly married to its author's muse, Maud Gonne. Ending with the assertion that “A terrible beauty is born,” its previous lines refer to the executions of such leaders as James Connolly and Patrick Pearse. Named for the holiday and the year on which a certain event took place, for 10 points, identify this poem commemorating a failed Irish uprising, a work by William Butler Yeats.

This polity saw a group of thirty-three men led by Antonio Lavalleja declare it to be part of the southern United Provinces, and it was previously annexed by its northern neighbor into the Cisplatine Province. Colonia del Sacramento was the first major city founded in this country, which was led by Jose de Artigas. This country gained independence through an 1828 treaty brokered by Britain, after which it saw a war between factions led by Fructuoso Rivera and Manuel Oribe. For 10 points, identify this South American country which saw intermittent conflicts between the Blancos and Colorados and was originally named the Banda Oriental.

Aided by such men as Halitherses, this figure once took in a stranger from Pylos named Theoclymenus, who told him about a “bird of omen” he'd seen. Some stories claim that this figure married and fathered Perseptolis with a woman who'd once bathed him, Polycaste, while others claim that he married his possible half-sister Cassiphone or the princess Nausicaa. He learned of a prophecy of Proteus from Menelaus, whom he visited after leaving the court of Nestor, and he undertook those travels on the advice of Athena, who was disguised as Mentor. Palamedes once placed him in front of a plow to foil his father's attempts at avoiding a certain conflict by pretending to be mad. He would ultimately be reunited with his father in Eumaeus' hut. He would later help that father by clearing the palace halls of weapons in order to ambush a bunch of suitors. For 10 points, identify this prince of Ithaca, the son of Penelope and Odysseus.

Substitutions of an alanine at position 143 or a histidine at position 175 allow this protein to bind to hsp70. Its L2 loop binds to an ankyrin repeat of a protein homologous to ASPP1. Wip-1 reduces the activity of this protein by dephosphorylating MAP kinase. The C-terminal RING finger motif of one protein promotes ubiquitination of this protein, while the N-terminal domain of that MDM-2 protein binds to it. Inheritance of only one copy of the gene coding for it leads to Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Human cancers typically involve mutations in either the retinoblastoma pathway or the pathway involving this protein. For 10 points, name this tumor suppressor, the “guardian angel of the genome.”
