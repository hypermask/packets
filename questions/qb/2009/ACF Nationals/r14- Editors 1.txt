answer: {Culpepper's} Rebellion

John Gibbs led a revolt in its epicenter a few years after this event, which saw prisoners held for two weeks in the house of Captain Crawford. Arms for this event were provided by Captain Zachary Gilliam, which started after Valentine Byrd and Timothy Biggs were replaced by Thomas Eastchurch and Thomas Miller to enforce a statute ignored by John Judkins and Governor Drummond. One of its leaders was later exonerated thanks to testimony in London by the Earl of Shaftesbury, and it was also led by George Durant. Sparked by the enforcement of the colony's proprietors of the Navigation Acts and based in the Albermarle region, for 10 points, name this 1677-1679 rebellion which made its namesake the temporary governor of the Carolinas.

answer: {Channel Firing}

One character in this poem describes “nations striving strong” as being “mad as hatters”, and another wonders “will the world ever saner be." Another stanza cites the drooling of the "glebe cow," as well as “the howl of wakened hounds” and describes how “the worms drew back into the mounds” after the titular event. Stourton Tower, Camelot, and “starlit Stonehenge” are reached by the sound of the title activity which “broke the chancel window-squares,” and caused the narrator and his companions to think "it was the Judgment-day”. Written in April 1914, its second to last stanza features Parson Thirdly, a character from the author's novel Far From the Madding Crowd, noting that he should have stuck to pipes and beer rather than preaching. Beginning “That night your great guns, unawares / shook all our coffins as we lay," for 10 points, name this poem describing English naval drills, a work by Thomas Hardy.

answer: {transposons} [or {transposable} genetic elements; prompt on {jumping genes}]

Pogo and tad are two of the few examples of these entities found in Neurospora. In May 2005, Kapitonov and Jurka found the first “free-living” one in a tunicate. Nancy Kleckner used the lacZ gene to demonstrate one process performed by them, while another process was modeled by Jim Shapiro, after whom an intermediate involving them is named. Johng Kim studied their hobo variety, and Discovery Genomics, Inc. has trademarked the Sleeping Beauty variant. Some forms of hemophilia may be caused by the LINE variety, and the SINE variety includes the Alu gene that accounts for around ten percent of human DNA. Unlike replicons, they do not contain their own replication origin. For 10 points, name these genetic elements that include the P element, which “jump” from place to place in a molecule of DNA.

Deutsch and Gerard repeated this experiment using partitions to decrease uncertainty. Crutchfield's modified version of this experiment demonstrated that its central findings held when subjects were presented with statements of opinions. This experiment was designed to correct for the subjectivity of previous experiments involving the autokinetic effect. The psychologist who performed this experiment divided its subjects into "yielders" and "independents" in his writings about it, which include "Opinions and Social Pressure." Subjects in this experiment were placed sixth out of a group of seven, and told that they were participating in a vision test. During this experiment, subjects were shown a card with lines marked A, B, and C, and asked to select the one most similar to line X. For 10 points, name this experiment in which confederates who gave unanimously wrong answers influenced subjects to select an incorrect line.

On the cover of the album named for this song, the singer wears black boots and a dress and has a woman's hairstyle while lounging on a blue-draped couch in front of a floor where several dozen photographs are scattered. Some of its lyrics are borrowed from William Huhes Means's poem "Antigonish." When this song was first performed on Saturday Night Live, along with "TVC 15" and "Boys Keep Swinging," its singer was wearing a plastic tuxedo and was backed up by performance artist Klaus Nomi. The original singer of this song collaborated with Lulu to produce its first hit cover, while another cover of this song was performed after a version of "Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam" and before "Pennyroyal Tea" on an acoustic album recorded at the Sony studios in New York. This song is narrated by a figure who "searched for form and land" after stating "I thought you died alone a long long time ago" to someone whom he "passed upon the stairs." For 10 points, name this song in which the narrator claims "we never lost control" after being "face to face" with the titular merchant, the title track of a 1970 David Bowie album which was notably redone by Nirvana.

It compares the pursuit of pleasure by men to the stinging of a bee because each leaves something behind after the act. The last part opens with the story of a farmer digging for gold to illustrate the belief in chance. It discusses the concept of “honor” by referring to “an ulcer” of a man named Nonius and illustrates its consideration of the “world-soul” with references to Plato's Timaeus. This volume inspired Alcuin's preface to De Grammatica, and its translators included such authors as Jean de Meun and Geoffrey Chaucer.

answer: Alejo {Carpentier}

His short stories include one in which five different Noahs sail five different boats, “The Chosen,” as well as a humorous work about an ambassador, “Right of Sanctuary.” Both of those stories were collected in The War of Time, a volume that preceded this man's novel about a conquistador's encounter with Vivaldi and the subsequent decision to compose the opera Motezuma. Another of his novels, which features the prostitute Estrella and climaxes at a concert hall during a performance of Eroica, centers on the pursuit of an informer and is called Manhunt. In another novel, this author adopted the story of Victor Hughes, a naval hero who led the assault against the British at Guadeloupe. That work, originally called The Age of Enlightenment, was translated into English as Explosion in a Cathedral. His earliest success which begins with the resistance of Macandal and tells the story of Ti Noel, who lives through the revolution in his native Haiti, may be best known for its preface which argued for an intermingling of the everyday with the miraculous in Latin American Literature. For 10 points, identify this Cuban author of such works as The Lost Steps, who introduced the concept of magical realism in his novel The Kingdom of this World.

This work's second subject, in E major, introduces a moment of tranquility, but is soon overtaken by the rhythmic intensity of the main theme. In the finale, that main theme, a seven note melody, begins quieter, then transforms into ecstatic celebration, and is marked Rondo (Allegretto moderato). This work, which opens with a pulsating progression, originally included an Andante favori at the beginning of the final movement, but this was a replaced by a shorter Adagio introduction. Its composition was preceded by the composer's acquisition of an Erard fortepiano in 1803.

Though he is not from the eighteenth century, this man was mocked in periodicals such as The Mosquito and The Meddler. An unsuccessful revolt against Decree 798 and other parts of his attempt to take a national census is sometimes known as the “war of the wasps,” and peasants destroyed scales to protest this man's new system of weights and measures in the “Smash the Kilos” revolt. This man's fight over whether bishops could expel freemasons from their churches is known as the “Religious Question,” and his son-in-law, the Count d'Eu, was derisively known as “The Frenchman.” Abraham Lincoln is said to have remarked that this man was the only one he trusted to arbitrate the U.S. Civil War. He eliminated the practice of kissing the royal hand upon returning from a trip to Europe, during which his daughter Isabel enacted the Law of the Free Womb, which freed children of slaves in his country.

This construct is related to the m = 5 and m = 6 cases of a Virasoro algebra discrete series representation. A chiral form of it was developed by Rodney Baxter, and the Tutte polynomial is a generalization of the chromatic polynomial that applies to the partition function of this construct. Pauline Hogeweg extended its cellular type, also known as the Glazier/Graner model, to the study of morphogenesis, and its original formulation, known as the clock model, becomes the XY model as q approaches infinity. Its Hamiltonian is expressed as a summation of Kronecker delta functions of all sites on the lattice. For 10 points, identify this model that is also known as the Ashkin-Teller model and is exactly solvable in one dimension, a model of lattice spins that is a generalization of the Ising Model.

This work critiques the definition of “sad” and “happy” songs and questions the utility of the rallying cry, “protect our women.” At one point its author recalls that his devout father feared his ambition and it recounts his struggles for acceptance at a majority Jewish school. This work argues that life is tragic and that the majority of people in the author's community believe the cold war, not a desire to change, precipitated the decision in Brown v. Board. It outlines and ultimately rejects the teachings of Elijah Muhammad and is divided into two of what its author has dubbed “letters:” one “to the author's nephew,” the other “from a region in the author's mind.” Its final pages repeatedly ask, “What will happen to all that beauty?,” and cites Du Bois' assertion that “The Problem of the 20th Century is the problem of the color line” in order to urge white Americans to reexamine what they think, before the titular disaster occurs. For 10 points, identify this 1963 book, composed of the sections “My Dungeon Shook” and “Down at the Cross,” a plea for racial acceptance by James Baldwin.

In one story, an enraged Diomedes took this figure's body and tossed it into the river Scamander. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, this figure, who was arrayed in “flaming mail that resembled lightning,” wielded a pair of spears and a halberd created by Eris; with these weapons, this figure killed such warriors as Machaon and Podarces. Chalon of Cyparissus met his end trying to defend this figure, while Cleite's ship was blown off course during a voyage to meet up and join this figure's expeditionary force, whose other members included Themodosa and an eventual successor, Antianara. It was this figure's purification at the hands of Priam that motivated this ruler to come to Troy. Shortly after this figure's death, the bow-legged Thersites mocked a certain Greek hero for falling in love with this woman's corpse.

At one point in this work, its author makes a curious distinction between the Saracens and the Ishmaelites. Towards the end of this work, the narrator describes entering a temple with a foreign king and looking at images made out of stone and wood that appeared “as if the devil had devised them.” The fourth part of this work catalogs certain doomed couples, including Hercules and Omphale, and makes the point that lust always has consequences, even for the powerful. Scattered throughout this work are references to the historical exploits of Gerald the Fearless and the shepherd warrior Viriatus. Canto V, which documents a vision of St. Elmo's fire and a landing at Saint Helena Bay, may be best known for its introduction of the evil Adamastor, who controls the Cape of Good Hope and who is sent to interfere with the heroic fleet. First published in 1572, it begins with the author's appeal to the “nymphs of the Tagus” and sets up a struggle between Bacchus and Venus over a quest to reach India.

It includes such chapters as “Of the Diversity of Affections” and “Against the Enticings or Provokings unto Avarice.” One of its most notable sections asks why one should speak to God through a priest, when one can speak to God directly. It avoids any discussion of the sacraments and argues that scripture should be made freely available to all people. Its primary argument is that true Christianity is an inner, personal practice that is based on going back to the Bible and leaving aside rituals and ceremony. First translated into English by one of the author's students, William Tyndale, its composition and title were inspired by a meeting with an uneducated warrior. For 10 points, identify this 1503 work describing the nature of piety and true religion to a layman, written by Erasmus.
