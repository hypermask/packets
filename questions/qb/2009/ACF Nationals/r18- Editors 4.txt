answer: Anglo-{Ashanti} Wars

The resolution of one of the conflicts by this name involved a promise to end human sacrifice and a fine paid in gold dust. After another one of these events, the royal family was deported to the Seychelles. Another one of these was prompted by a ten-year buildup which included provocations such as the seizure of Elmina and the movement of troops under Kwaku Dua. Garnet Wolsely's sack of Kumasi ended one of them, and the last one erupted when Frederich Hodgson sought to use a certain piece of furniture as his gubernatorial seat, provoking the final conflict of this nature, also called the War of the Golden Stool. For 10 points, identify this series of wars fought in the second half of the nineteenth century between British colonizers and a West African people.

In addition to that story in which rich car salesman Chandler Vaught gives each of his children a hundred thousand dollars, The Last Gentleman, this author wrote about the psychic Miss Marva, who sells “astrological real estate” to some black radicals who occupy Paradise Estates. That novel is about the inventor of the lapsometer and is subtitled “The Adventures of a Bad Catholic at a Time Near the End of the World.” In another of his novels, a breakup with Walter Wade causes Kate to attempt suicide, but a trip to Chicago with Binx Bolling cheers her up.

answer: {population inversion}

The requirement that this state be achieved has been circumvented by using quantum interference in rubidium and on the D1 line of cesium by Marlan Scully. This process can be enhanced by using heterojunctions composed of gallium arsenide between layers of aluminum arsenide, and this state can be created in hydrogen by applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field to a gas undergoing the 21-cm transition. It is usually explained through a four-level system, which is characteristic of rare earth ions like neodymium, or the simpler three-level system with the top layer known as the "pump band", as seen in ruby. For 10 points, identify this situation where a majority of particles are in a more excited state, which is necessary for the operation of most lasers.

The fourth section includes a lusty tavern song that was originally intended for voice but is usually played by a wind instrument and is set against a backdrop of sleighbells. The second section, which features a dark melancholy theme, is typically played by a double bass or the saxophone. Beginning with an offstage fanfare for cornet, its fifth and final part, “The Internment,” ends with a muted trumpet, but is preceded by melodies from the other movements recalling the titular figure's career. Due to translation issues, it was originally released in the United States as the score to a film by Alexander Feinzimmer called The Czar Wants to Dance.

answer: The {Second} Amendment

University of Texas professor Sanford Levinson questioned why this provision does not get more coverage in legal journals in an article titled for its "embarrassing" consequences. The 1886 Presser v. Illinois case, which said that this restriction does not apply at the state level, was challenged in April 2009 by a Ninth Circuit ruling which held that this amendment is now incorporated. The majority opinion in a recent case addressing this law noted that “a purposive qualifying phrase that contradicts the word or phrase it modifies is unknown this side of the looking glass, except, apparently, in some courses on Linguistics.” An earlier Supreme Court case addressing this amendment turned on the transportation of an item from Oklahoma to Arkansas in violation of a federal registration statute and the meaning of the phrase “well-regulated militia.” For 10 points, identify this subject of the DC v. Heller and U.S. v. Miller rulings, a Constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to keep and bear arms.

Its central figures re-unite in a valley full of pomegranate trees, and one later accuses a group of being “bloodthirsty tigers” before being clubbed to death. At the start of this story, one character begins to hang himself in jail at the sound of bells, because his lover is going to be executed for committing adultery while a Carmelite nun at Our Lady of the Mountain.

These structures are notably absent in dogs and cats with the Pelger-Huët anomaly, and they are absent in flies and C. elegans because, in those organisms, their major function is performed by the Sxl and sdc-2 proteins, respectively. Boggs et al. hypothesized that these structures may be characterized by hypoacetylation of core histones, and Mermoud et al. showed that the histone macroH2A1.2 relocates to these structures after they are formed. Their formation is opposed by the gene TSIX, which inhibits the production of siRNA by the gene XIST. They are formed by lyonization, named after Mary Lyon, who hypothesized that they are responsible for dosage compensation. These structures are absent in Turner's syndrome, while multiple ones of them occur in Kleinfelter's syndrome. For 10 points, name these inactivated X chromosomes.

His glamorous portraits of the Royal Ladies in Waiting are now known as the Hampton Court Beauties. This rival of Peter Lely's, who succeeded him as Charles II's Painter to the Crown, eventually bought a house at Whitton where he became Alexander Pope's neighbor; fitting, since he would go on to paint the leading literary figures of his day, including Pope, Steele, and Vanbrugh, in a namesake series of less than half length portraits.

This character supposedly resides in the "most sincere" location, and in a special named for this character, his primary supporter gives the advice of "never jump into a pile of leaves with a wet sucker."

Pulsed amperometry is combined with this technique in analysis of sugars. Preparation of reagents for this technique include sparging and endcapping, though endcapping cannot fully prevent the peak-tailing problem encountered in one version of it. The MuDPIT technique developed by John Yates employs a multidimensional form of this technique followed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Invented by Csaba Horváth, it often uses either a refractive index or UV detector. This technique employs “organic modifiers” to control the polarity of the mobile phase in its “reverse phase” variety, and it also comes in “normal phase” and “ion exchange” forms. For 10 points, name this version of column chromatography in which a mobile phase that is neither solid nor gas is forced through a column at a high flow rate, allowing for the analysis and separation of small molecules.

Perhaps most famous for its metaphor of a “transparent eyeball” that sees nothing but sees all, it was partially completed in the same room as Mosses for an Old Manse.

One leader in a war for this cause was known as the Bronze Titan and issued the Protest of Baraguá against compromises in this pursuit, whose advocates were later subjected to the “reconcentration” policy. Another man who worked for this goal summoned all his slaves in order to announce that they were free and should join his army in pursuit of this end. This cause was advocated in the Grito de Yara by the antislavery activist Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, and advocates for this goal were briefly placated with the Pact of Zanjón by a man who had earlier fought against the Carlists, Arsenio Martínez Campos. Antonio Maceo and Calixto García were later leaders in conflicts fought to achieve this end, known as the Little War and the Ten Years War. Brutally suppressed by Valeriano Weyler, this cause achieved success after the explosion of the Maine triggered U.S. involvement.
