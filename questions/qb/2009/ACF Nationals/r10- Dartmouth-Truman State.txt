answer: {Antonio Allegri da Correggio}

This artist painted a work in which Mary offers her breast to a distracted baby Jesus, the Madonna del Latte. He depicted a tense and trembling Mary Magdalene kneeling before Christ in a golden dress in his Noli Me Tangere and included a golden lion's head at the bottom of his Madonna of St. Jerome. His frescoed ceilings and walls with scenes of the hunt were meant to recreate a bower sacred to Diana for the Abbess' salon in the Camera di San Paolo, and he painted twelve apostles sitting around the base of a dome and staring at a foreshortened Christ for the San Giovanni Evangelista. His greatest works were to be given as gifts to Charles V and were commissioned by Frederico Gonzaga; they depicted such scenes as the Abduction of Ganymede, Leda and the Swan, and Danae receiving the "golden rain." For 10 points, identify this painter of the Assumption of the Virgin for the Cathedral of Parma, as well as the Loves of Jupiter.

This company is the only major American corporation with a "Manager of Non-Traditional Marketing" and is currently led by two former Rally's executives. Like its leading competitor, this chain was founded in Denver in the mid-1990s. In 2006, the opening of one of these restaurants in the White City Shopping Center of Shrewsbury, Massachussetts, led to a court case in which Panera Bread sued over an exclusivity agreement. The resultant ruling held that a burrito is not a sandwich. Currently owned by Jack in the Box, this company rolled out the "Ancho Chile burrito" in 2007 to go with other menu items such as the mango salad and Fajita Ranchera burrito. For 10 points, name this vendor which offers poblano pesto and "fiery habañero" salsa on its products as it competes with Chipotle.

answer: {photorespiration}

The Bloom lab at UC Davis showed that inhibiting this process also inhibited nitrate assimilation in plant shoots. 5-FCL removes 5-formyl-THF, which inhibits this process by binding to SHMT. SHMT cooperates with GDC to mediate glycine-serine interconversion in this process. In one step of this process, two glycine molecules are converted to one serine molecule, and in a later step in the peroxisome, serine is reduced to glycerate. The final step of this process occurs in the chloroplast and sees glycerate phosphorylated to 3-phosphoglycerate, which subsequently enters the Calvin cycle. For 10 points, name this side reaction that releases carbon dioxide when oxygen binds to RuBP instead of carbon dioxide.

answer: {Franck}-{Condon} principle

Raymond Birge first jointly referenced the namesakes of this idea in a 1926 Physical Review article on the band structure of carbon monoxide. A schematic representation of the absorption and fluorescence spectra using this principle leads to an approximate mirror symmetry when applied along with Kasha's rule. A close analogy of it occurs due to the interaction of phonons and the quantum mechanical formulation of this principle can be interpreted such that the intensity of a vibronic transition is proportional to the square of the overlap integral between the two vibrational wavefunctions involved. For 10 points, name this dually eponymous principle sometimes interpreted to mean that electronic transitions occur instantaneously relative to nuclear motion.

answer: {prospect} theory

Thirteen years after the development of this concept, its originators put forth its cumulative version that corrected a violation of first order stochastic dominance. Chapter 16 of Peter Bernstein's Against the Gods discusses the formation and development of this theory, which is often represented by a graph that rapidly increases in the fourth quadrant but flattens out in the first quadrant. One example of this concept, which can be avoided by hedonic framing, is the disposition effect, which occurs when investors tend to sell assets that have appreciated but hold those that have depreciated. This theory contradicts the belief that people process the net effect of gains and losses, and argues instead that gains and losses are valued differently. For 10 points, name this theory from behavioral economics about the assessment of risk, developed by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.

The main female character of this novel carried on a romance with the easy-going miner Gustaf before marrying her husband. Prior to selling his land, one man helps another character leave prison, where she was sent after the rumor-mongering of her sister and the Lapp tramp Os-Anders. In this novel, the daughter of the lazy Brede Olson was forced to live with Fru Heyerdahl after she defended her from accusations of infanticide. Babro's claim that she stumbled in a brook while pregnant, which led to her daughter drowning, does not convince the owner of Maaneland, though he ends up marrying her anyways. Another infanticide resulted after the birth of a daughter with a harelip, though the mother later gives birth to Leopoldine in prison.

answer: {carbonic anhydrase}

In marine diatoms, the catalytic metal in this enzyme may be substituted with either cadmium or cobalt. In humans, this enzyme is inhibited by drugs such as acetazolamide in order to treat glaucoma, hypertension, and osteoporosis. A mutation in which alanine replaces the histidine at position 64 decreases catalysis by this enzyme, lending support to the hypothesis that that histidine deprotonates an aqua ligand to start the reaction it catalyzes. The resulting hydroxide ligand then attacks a linear triatomic substrate to generate a biologically important buffer ion. It was the first discovered enzyme to have an active site including zinc. For 10 points, name this enzyme that catalyzes the hydration of carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate.
