answer: {Lev Vygotsky}

One of this thinker's students developed activity theory along with Rubinstein. This thinker distinguished between primary defects caused by heredity and secondary defects caused by a person's social environment, and argued that the apex of knowledge was decontextualization, or the ability to transfer a skill into a new context. This psychologist asserted that egocentric speech leads to advanced thought, and postulated the importance of assistance from More Knowledgeable Others. Steven Toulmin called this thinker the "Mozart of Psychology," and his ideas were promulgated by his students Leont'ev and Luria. Scaffolding is based on the ideas of this psychologist, who postulated a space between a person's actual level of development and his or her potential area of development. For 10 points, name this Russian psychologist whose book Mind in Society introduced the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development.

answer: Kingdom/Empire of {Kongo}

This empire was the site of a heretical movement that legalized polygamy and opposed the use of crucifixes, Antonianism, led by native prophet Donna Beatrice. It declined following a loss at the Battle of Mbwila. A long civil war in this empire was ended by an agreement to alternate the kingship between the Kimpanzu and Kinlaza. Other problems befell it in 1568, when this empire was occupied by the Jagas, and its ruler Álvaro I had to seek foreign help to reconquer its territory. Its capital was at a city renamed São Salvador under colonization, which has since reverted to its original name of Mbanzaa. Founded by its first "mani," Lukeni lua Nimi, this land was Christianized in 1491 but was ultimately absorbed into the Portuguese colonial empire following a souring of relations with Angola. For 10 points, name this empire which existed from 1390 to 1914 in southwest Africa and shares its name with two modern-day countries.

answer: {crystal defects} [prompt on {crystals} until "{lattice}"]

These entities can be described using Kröger-Vink notation. The Howie-Whelan theory was developed to account for them, and Kikuchi lines are used to select conditions under which to image them. The Brouwer diagram plots the log of the change in their concentration against temperature or partial pressure of oxygen. Wadsley ones occur due to randomly spaced shear planes, and linear ones can be classified using Volterra's method. The most common ones are named after Frenkel, in which an ion migrates to an interstitial site, and Schottky, in which both cations and anions are missing completely. Divided into stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric varieties, for 10 points, name these places in a lattice that contain misplaced atoms.

answer: {Huffman Coding}

A variation of this algorithm which preserves the natural ordering does not perform a merge if an original node exists between two merged nodes and is named for Hu and Tucker. Faller, Gallagher, Knuth, and Vitter all worked on a modification to this algorithm which allowed it to operate in one pass, the so-called dynamic or adaptive form of it. The length limited version of this problem is reduced to the Coin-Collector problem in a generalization of it known as the Package-Merge Algorithm. It is more efficient than a similar technique named for Shannon and Fano, and the selection of the locally smallest two nodes at each step makes it a Greedy Algorithm. Using a binary tree to create prefix-free codes so that the most frequently used symbol has the smallest code, for 10 points, name this type of lossless data compression named for an MIT Computer Scientist.

They eventually split into two factions, primarily over the question of communal land ownership. One of those factions, the Sons of Freedom, would lead a series of nudist strikes.The major element in their life was “the gathering,” at which large passages of the Book of Life would be read, and their leaders included a man named Silva and Peter Verigin who commanded a namesake rebellion. It was their refusal to be conscripted that led to their exile from the land they'd been given by Alexander I around the Sea of Azov. Originally called “Christians of the Universal Brotherhood,” after they burned their weapons in an 1895 protest, their struggle and eventual emigration to Canada was supported by Leo Tolstoy. For 10 points, identify this Russian religious sect whose supposedly heretical beliefs led to them being given a name that translates as “Spirit Wrestlers.”

answer: {Klein}-{Nishina} formula

The Meitner-Hupfeld effect is a deviation from this formula in heavy elements. The first experimental confirmations of this were made by Louis Gray, and studies of it by Chung-yao Chao led to the discovery of the positron. Mathematically, one side of it can be expressed as the product of the fine structure constant, Compton radius, and several terms containing the ratio of the photon energy before and after collisions, and, for low energies, it reduces to the classical Thomson equation. For 10 points, identify this formula that was the first experimental proof for Dirac's relativistic electron theory, which gives the differential cross section of a photon scattered by an unbound electron.

Though the first of these conflicts ended bloodlessly due to a settlement engineered by Niklaus Manuel, the second one soon erupted after a dispute over a 2500-crown reparation payment led to a blockade. In the period between these two conflicts, an invasion by Giangiacomo Medici was turned back by the same man who defended Valais in the second of these wars, Hans Franz Nägeli. The second one included the battles of Saint Gall and Schaffhausen, where the forces of Jörg Göldli were defeated. The first of these conflicts ended with an agreement by the Christian Union to cease allying with Austria, and the second erupted during a dispute over forced conversions in Thurgau. Named for a monastery that straddled the Zug and Zürich, these conflicts erupted in 1529 and 1531.

This artist painted numerous nude images of Betalo Rubino, but also painted her in costume as a Dancer of Dehli. This man adopted Hardesty Maratta's twelve basic color system later in his career; this switch brightened his subsequent portraits appreciably when compared to such earlier works as his Gypsy series and Laughing Boy. His admiration for Degas was evident in such works as Dancer in a Yellow Shawl and his portrait of Madame Voclezca as Richard Strauss' Salome.His theories were eventually collected in The Art Spirit, some years after this student of Thomas Anshutz moved from Philadelphia to New York where he made his name. It was his decision to spurn the National Academy of Design that led him to organize a breakthrough show at the Macbeth Gallery in 1908, that exhibition featured such like minded artists as William Glackens and George Luks.

In it, the author debunks the work of Antonio Maffei on the relationship between “crooked feet” and sleep. It also argues that Joseph Spence's translations are intolerable to any reader of taste, and opens by ruminating on the depiction of grief and the need to temper violence for the sake of beauty.Its ultimate conclusion, which follows a comparison of Virgil's Shield of Aeneas versus Homer's description of the Shield of Achilles, recalls an earlier argument made in the 1757 essay “Main Principles on the Fine Arts and Sciences,” by the author's close friend, Moses Mendelssohn. Concerned with delineating the limits of representation, it was written primarily as a response to the ideas of Johann Winckelmann. For 10 points, identify this 1766 work of aesthetic philosophy that takes its name from a statue depicting a Trojan priest being strangled by a serpent, written by Gotthold Lessing.
