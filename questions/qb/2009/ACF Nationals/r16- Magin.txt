The second of this man's namesake functions is sometimes approximated as x minus the log of two pi. That the remainder when dividing prime numbers by 4 is more likely to be 3 than 1 is called this man's “bias”. His namesake distance operation is sometimes called the chessboard distance, and his two namesake polynomial sequences, symbolized T sub n and U sub n, have recursive definitions, as they are solutions to his namesake differential equation.

answer: {attention} [accept word forms]

Hans Phaf created a connectionist model of this concept, SLAM. Eriksen and St. James developed the zoom-lens model of this concept in contrast to the spotlight model of it.  According to Anne Treisman's model of this concept, selected features are assimilated into a saliency map. That model is known as feature integration theory. The Stroop effect occurs because of interference with this concept. Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris demonstrated this concept's "blindness" in an experiment in which fifty percent of subjects did not perceive a person in a gorilla suit because they were counting the number of times that teams passed a basketball. For 10 points, name this psychological concept which William James defined as the mind's possession "of one out of...several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought," whose deficit leads to a disorder found in hyperactive children.

One variation on this reaction proceeds via the Smiles rearrangement. Poly-?-leucine acts as a catalyst in an epoxidation reaction named after Colonna and this reaction's namesake. Keck et al. demonstrated that when samarium (II) iodide is used in the second step of this reaction, deuterium from a deuterated methanol solvent is not incorporated into the final product, in contrast to the use of a sodium amalgam in that second step. A variant that eliminates that second step is partially named after Kocienski. An alcohol intermediate is formed in its first step via the addition of a phenyl sulfone to an aldehyde or ketone. For 10 points, name this alternative to the Schlosser modification of the Wittig reaction for producing (E)-alkenes.

Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in PEST domains activates this process when it is mediated by calpains, and when mediated by the von Hippel-Lindau complex, a leucine at position 574 of HIF-1? is necessary. Ti and La are ATPases that perform this process in E. coli, and this process can also be performed using phenyl isothiocyanate. The cathepsins perform this process in lysosomes.

Six types of these formations have been listed by Robert Riding, including tufa and skeletal. First coined in name by Kalkowsky in 1908, one group of them, Conophyton, is characteristic of Late Precambrian sequences. The study of fossilized ones in general was driven by a discovery of Stanley Tyler and Elso Barghoorn in the Gunflint Formation, where these have created a namesake form of chert. A rare example of a living one of these can be seen at Shark Bay in Australia. Similar to calcretes, these organosedimentary structures typically form when cyanobacteria present in algal mats acts to trap and laminate sediment in thread-like filaments on the floor of a body of water. For 10 points, name these formations which provide the oldest macroscopic evidence of life on Earth, whose name comes from the Greek for "stony carpet."
