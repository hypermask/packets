answer: The {Sickness Unto Death} [or {Sygdommen til Doden}]

This work contains a discussion of recognizing oneself in a mirror and recognizing the self in “the mirror of possibility.” It claims that while the loss “of an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife” will be noticed by a religious fanatic, he will not notice that he has lost the self. According to this work, even “feminine youthfulness” is informed by the the titular phenomenon, which it explains can be caused by blind ambition or what its author terms the need to be "Caesar or nothing." Scattered throughout are references to plays like Macbeth and Richard II, and it explains the “defiance” and “weak” types of a certain phenomenon. This work ultimately asserts that true Christians are the only ones who can escape the title condition. For 10 points, name this work published under the pseudonym “Anti-Climacus” whose title malady is described as “despair,” a book by Soren Kierkegaard.

answer: {Oslo Accords}

Its first component was the Declaration of Principles, which promised, among other things, the formation of a Committee for Economic Cooperation that was to include the Electricity Developent Program. The APF formed as a coalition of those opposed to this treaty, and a key mediator in the negotiation of this treaty was the man who was later criticized for declaring the West "stingy" in response to the 2004 tsunami, Jan Egeland. Almost immediately after the signing of these documents, the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre soured relations between the parties. Including a change to the charter of one party to remove clauses about the “destruction” of the other, the completion of its first phase was signified by a celebrated handshake on the White House lawn. For 10 points, name this 1993 series of agreements between Yitzhak Rabin and Yassir Arafat on Palestinian autonomy.

answer: {stress}-{energy} tensor

The conservation law for this quantity depends on whether the context is special or general relativity, as in the former situation the divergence is 0, and by Noether's theorem, the translation symmetries imply this conserved current. While it is generally symmetric, this is not true if the spin tensor is nonzero. In general relativity, where the conservation law is more complicated, there is a relation between it and another quantity which is a nonlinear function of the metric and which satisfies the Bianchi identity. It has an electromagnetic portion which can be expressed as a function of the electromagnetic field tensor. It is a relativistic generalization of a quantity from mechanics that is graphically represented as Mohr's circle, expresses the internal force per area of surface on which the force acts, and whose eigenvalues are called principle stresses. For 10 points, name this quantity which appears in the Einstein field equations as proportional to the Einstein tensor, is defined as the flux of generalized momenta through spacetime, and which causes and determines the way spacetime curves.
