answer: {seismometer} or {seismograph} [{grudgingly} accept {seismoscope} or {even seismogram}]

These devices are characterized by a magnification coefficient that appears in the indicator equation characterizing the instrument response.Most modern examples of them use force feedback and employ Galitzin's innovation of using a transducer to couple to a galvanometer. The reduced response of Galitzin systems was a critical factor in developing the Sprengnether and Benioff variants of these instruments. The Wood-Anderson torsion variant is used in defining a popular magnitude scale.Their placement in a borehole will reduce the noise recorded by them, which has been used to infer the locations of large storm centers. They record arrival times of S and P waves, whose difference is proportional to the distance to the epicenter. For 10 points, name these devices used to record earthquakes.

answer: Karlheinz {Stockhausen}

This man wrote a collection of thirty-two pieces that each begin with a "stroke" from a Japanese temple instrument.The 17-piece collection For Times to Come accompanies a set of fifteen works, one of which requests the performers to fast in silence for four days. In addition to From the Seven Days, this composer wrote a piece based on the Book of Daniel called Song of the Youths, as well as Crossplay, a work scored for oboe, bass clarinet, piano, and three percussionists that was inspired by Messiaen.Michael, Eve, and Lucifer are the central characters in an opera cycle, parts of which are performed as some of his Klavierstücke and whose individual works are named for days of the week. A proponent of "formula composition" and "punctual" music, for 10 points, name this German composer of Helicopter String Quartet and Kontra-Punkte, whose opera cycle Licht is an example of his electronic music.

answer: The {Heart} of Perfect Wisdom {Sutra} [or The Essence of {Wisdom Sutra}]

This text claims that a bodhisattva “has not been made to tremble” because he “dwells without thought coverings” and that “there is no cognition, no attainment and no non-attainment.” The longer version used by Tibetans opens with the Lord Buddha at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rajagriha with a gathering of sangha, and that version asks how a child of a noble family is supposed to train. It mentions “no eye element up to no mind element and no mind consciousness element” among a litany of concepts declared to be empty, and the primary figure of this text realizes the emptiness of the five skandhas and earlier claims that “Form is emptiness; emptiness is form.” It contains the mantra “om gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha” and this work is largely addressed to Shariputra. It features Avalokitesvara instead of Subhuti, unlike most works of the Perfection of Wisdom genre. For 10 points, name this text which, along with the Diamond sutra, is among the most important sutras in Mahayana Buddhism.

One group in the universe of this game, the Tolgath, rang the Apocalypse Chime, which was later recovered in Ulgrotha by the vampire Baron Sengir. A magical ship in the continuity of this game was invented at the Tolarian Academy and transported the Bones of Ramos. That vehicle, the Skyship Weatherlight, was designed by Urza, whose wars with Yawgmoth and Mishra scarred the plains of Dominaria. Recently expanded with the Shadowmoor and Shards of Alara sets, this game has a "Power Nine" that includes the Ancestrall Recall and Timetwister. Common strategies in it depend on using the Counterspell or the Circle of Protection. For 10 points, name this Richard Garfield-designed card game, the flagship product of Wizards of the Coast, which involves tapping lands for white, green, red, blue, or black mana.

He is the namesake of the criterion that ions in a plasma must enter the Debye sheath at or above the sound speed.He expanded on de Broglie's pilot-wave theory to give a namesake theory that avoids the measurement problem. Plasma microinstabilities produce a scaling of one over the magnetic field strength in his eponymous anomalously rapid plasma diffusion process. With one of his students, he predicted a geometric phase observed in double-slit experiments due to the influence of the vector potential, even in regions with zero magnetic field. For 10 points, identify this proponent of a non-local hidden variables interpretation of quantum mechanics, the namesake of an effect with Aharonov.

In this battle, Zachariah Deas forced the retreat of General William Carlin from La Fayatte Road, before an attack on Lytle Hill caused confusion among opposing generals. The victorious general here had kept command despite the agitations of Leonidas Polk and William Hardy, while another of that general's critics began the fighting at this battle. That man was John C. Breckinridge, who attacked Glass's Mill. The right side of the Union line was demolished by reinforcements under Longstreet, but another man held position on the left side at Snodgrass Hill earning the nickname the “Rock of” this battle, George Henry Thomas. It saw the defeat of the Army of the Cumberland under William Rosecrans. For 10 points, identify this Civil War Battle on the Tennessee-Georgia border, a victory for Braxton Bragg.

answer: Jean Baptiste Simeon {Chardin}

One of his works depicts a Cross of the Order of St. Michael and a small plaster statue of Pigalle scattered among objects on a table. That piece, Attributes of the Arts, was painted a few years before this artist's failing vision caused him to turn primarily to working in pastels. Though he had no students of his own, his influence on subsequent painters, such as Lucian Freud, who made multiple copies of his The Schoolmistress, may be attributed to his use of short parallel strokes that built up layers of pigment.His earliest success, depicting a bristling cat next to a gutted fish, The Ray, was followed by notable half length portraits of children including Girl with a Shuttlecock and a picture depicting Monsieur Lenoir's Son Building a House of Cards. For 10 points, identify this French artist renowned for his still lifes and genre works, including 1734's Young Man Blowing Bubbles.

answer: Magnetic {monopoles}

In Grand Unified models, these particles catalyze proton decay in the Callan-Rubakov effect. One variety of them emerges and disappears in a tunneling event between two Gribov vacua, and in a 3-dimensional gauge theory with a Higgs field, one variety of them takes the role of an instanton. Besides the Wu-Yang and t'Hooft-Polyakov varieties, a dyon with no electrical charge is one of them. A curve from one of these to infinity is known as the Dirac string, while the Dirac one is a topological defect in compact U(1) gauge theories. Their existence would change the right hand side of Gauss's law and explain the quantization of electric charge. For 10 points, name these hypothetical particles which would be units of magnetic charge.

answer: {cytokinesis}

This process requires Polo-like kinases and the formation of a complex including the proteins Incenp, survivin, and Aurora B. In Arabidopsis, this process requires the syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE. During this process, E-C-T-two in conjunction with RhoA activates non-muscle myosin II and targets anillin, cofilin, and other actin-binding proteins, which have been localized to an area partially determined by astral microtubules. This process occurs via phragmoplast formation and Golgi body vesicle fusion in plants, creating the cell plate. In animal cells, it involves the formation of a contractile ring. In both cases, it requires the formation of a cleavage furrow. For 10 points, name this process of dividing a cell's cytoplasm to form two daughter cells.

answer: {Jahn}-{Teller} effect or distortion

The cooperative pseudo- form of this phenomenon has been linked to the vibronic theory of ferroelectricity. A version of this phenomenon arising from mixing of two or more interacting states was studied by Opik and Pryce. The Ham factor is used to simplify calculations of electronic and vibronic properties affected by this phenomenon. It is frequently observed in complexes where the e-sub-g orbitals contain an odd number of electrons, as in compounds of copper(II). For 10 points, name this effect in which nonlinear systems in a degenerate electronic state distort to remove the degeneracy, which can result in the distortion of a coordination compound with octahedral symmetry to tetragonal geometry.
