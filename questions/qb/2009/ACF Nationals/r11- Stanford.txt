answer: {Magnetoresistance} [accept {Giant Magnetoresistance} or {GMR}]

Bruce Gurney did pioneering work towards developing a room-temperature version of this phenomenon, while Xiao and Berkowiez independently discovered a type of this phenomenon in granular Cobalt-Copper solids. One version of it can be understood in terms of RKKY coupling, while devices which exploit a namesake type of this effect come in CPP and CIP varieties, and are known as spin valves. One version of this phenomenon is a result of spin-dependent electron scattering, and was discovered in Iron-Chromium-Iron multilayers by Albert Fert and Peter Grunberg in 1988. For 10 points, identify this effect in which a metal's conductivity is altered in the presence of a magnetic field and whose “giant” variety led to the 2007 Nobel in Physics, and which is commonly used in read-out heads in hard drives.

Sohrab Modi starred as the title character in a 1935 Indian version of it called Khoon-ka Khoon, which added seventeen songs to the work. A special jury prize at the 1964 Venice Film Festival went to a version of it in which Innokenty Smoktunovsky played the title character. That version was directed by Grigory Kozintsev, and was based on a translation of this work by Boris Pasternak. A Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode featured a re-enactment of a famous scene from this work as a game show in which participants had to identify the femur of Biz Markie; that episode watched a German version of this work that starred Maximilian Schell. Georges Méliès played the title character in a 1907 adaptation of this work which reduced it to ten minutes in length. Julie Christie played the title character's mother in a 1996 film of it, and a 2000 adaptation of it by Michael Almereyda is set in New York City and features the title character as a film student played by Ethan Hawke, who investigates goings-on at the Denmark Corporation. For 10 points, name this play which has also seen Kenneth Branagh and Laurence Olivier star in the title role of a melancholy denizen of Elsinore.

This thinker wrote about the poet Paul Celan in the essay “Who Am I and Who are You?" He investigated the art of medicine in The Enigma of Health Care, while his first important book focused on Plato's dialectical ethics. In another work, this author explored the ability of art to transport the reader or viewer from ordinary time to “fulfilled” or “autonomous” time, an idea that relates to the subtitular concept of art as “festival.” That essay, which further posits art as “play” and as “symbol,” is entitled “The Relevance of the Beautiful.” His most famous work, which criticizes Wilhelm Dilthey for his “entanglement in the aporias of historicism” and which led to various debates with Jurgen Habermas, describes the process of the “fusion of horizons” and argues for the importance of “historically-effected consciousness” in understanding and interpreting texts.

answer: {cooperativity} [prompt on early “{allostery}” or similar answers]

Avidity is a form of this concept resulting from polyvalency, and Levinthal's paradox assumes that one process governed by it proceeds via a sequential rather than parallel mechanism. The KNF model describes a sequential induced fit pattern for it, which accounts for the negative form of this phenomenon, while the WMC model proposes molecules changing conformation from a T-state to an R-state. It is quantified by the Hill coefficient, which for myoglobin is 1.0 and for hemoglobin is 2.8. It is typically exemplified by deoxyhemglobin's weaker affinity for oxygen versus oxyhemoglobin.

answer: {Heartbreak House}

The preface to this work notes that “those who do not know how to live must make a merit of dying” and contrasts the title thing to a “prison for horses” named Horseback. At the beginning of the second act, one character notes that macaroni is too rich for him, because he's a man of business and thus is “always thinking.” The final scene sees Nurse Guinness warning the characters that they will be summoned by the police if they don't put the light out. At the end, we learn that Randall at last “succeeds in keeping the home fires burning on his flute,” while an explosion seems to have killed Mangan. It also features Hesione Hushabye, Ellie Dunn, and the dynamite-obsessed rum fiend who has built the title structure in the shape of a ship, Captain Shotover.

His opus one is a single-movement piano concerto in F-sharp minor. Songs by this composer include the “Song of Selim” and a work that would later be adapted as this composer's Scherzo No.3, the “Song of the Golden Fish.” He gave the title 1000 Years to the second of his two overtures that he referred to as "a musical picture," and works inspired by Spain include the Fandango-etude for piano and the orchestral Overture on a Spanish March Theme. The second of his two second symphonies features a Scherzo alla cosacca, or Cossack scherzo, and he composed incidental music for King Lear. A symphonic poem about a beautiful but evil princess was inspired by the poetry of Lermontov, while his first successes including an orchestration of the The Lark and a Piano Fantasia on Life for the Tsar were based on the work of his predecessor and inspiration, Glinka.

answer: {Wilson's} disease [or {hepatolenticular degeneration}]

In Asian populations, this disease is most commonly caused by an arginine-to-leucine point mutation at position 778 of the gene responsible for it, while among Western populations, it can be caused by a deletion of cysteine at position 3402 or a histidine-to-glutamine point mutation at position 1069. That gene, found on chromosome 13, codes for a P-type cation transport ATPase called ATP7B. This disease causes liver damage via Fenton-like chemistry and deposition in Descemet's membrane called Kayser-Fleischer rings, and often results in decreased ceruloplasmin levels. After treatment, patients often take zinc acetate to prevent an excess amount of a particular element. Usually treated with penecillamine or chelating agents like syprine, for 10 points, name this condition, the most common cause of copper accumulation in the body.

answer: {Hunsdiecker}-{Borodin} reaction [or {Borodin}-{Hunsdiecker} reaction; accept early {Borodin reaction}]

When triethylamine is used as a catalyst in it, N-halosuccinimides, cinnamic acids, and propiolic acids can be converted into halostyrenes and haloalkynes. A similar reaction uses lead(IV) tetraacetate and lithium chloride to generate secondary and tertiary products, and is named after Kochi. If alpha-hydroxy and alpha-amino salts are used as substrates, aldehydes and ketones will results, and esters tend to form if iodine is used. It was first developed by Alexander Borodin, but is more often named after the husband-and-wife pair that converted it into a general method. It is similar to Kolbe electrolysis in that an alkane is formed from the decarboxylation of a carboxylic acid, and it usually proceeds via a hypobromite intermediate, eventually resulting in silver bromide. For 10 points, name this reaction that synthesizes alkyl halides from silver salts of carboxylic acids.

Efforts in this opera to lift the title character's spirits include the piano-accompanied “Lieben, hassen” and a quartet sung by four men with a coloratura soprano descant. That coloratura soprano role is best known for the massive aria “Grossmächtige Prinzessin!”, in which she lists men who have seduced her, to which the title character responds by withdrawing into her cave. The title location disappears upon the appearance of a certain god, and the Prologue to the opera, not included in its original version, ends with the Composer singing “Musik ist eine heilige Kunst.” Zerbinetta and four commedia dell'arte characters star in the comedy that infringes upon the Composer's opera seria, creating the opera-within-an-opera that forms the body of this work. For 10 points, identify this opera with libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, a work by Richard Strauss about the abandoned lover of Theseus.
