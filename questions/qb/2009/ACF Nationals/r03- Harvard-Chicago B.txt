answer: {Albania}

During World War II, resistance movements in this country included the Legality Party. Abdyl Ypi was unable to attend the Congress of Lushnjë, which reformed this country, because he was assassinated by the puppet government which ruled from Durrës. This modern state declared its independence in the Vlorë Proclamation, shortly after which it was ruled for six months by the German prince Wilhelm zu Wied. Riven by conflict between the traditionalist bajraktars and the liberalizing forces led by Fan Noli, it was later oppressed by a secret police called the Sigurimi. Since 1990, events in this country have included the fall of Ramiz Alia's dictatorship and the bankrupting of most of its population during a 1997 wave of pyramid schemes. Invaded by Italy during World War II, this country was once ruled by King Zog. For 10 points, name this state which became an isolated outpost of the Communist world under its longtime ruler Enver Hoxha.

answer: {MOdified Newtonian Dynamics}

Dodelson and Liguori showed in a 2006 paper that the vector field introduced in Bekenstein's relativistic version of this theory could play a role in generating the instability that produces large-scale cosmic structures. Mathematically, it results from a modification of Poisson's equation, and evidence against this theory came in 2006 when the Bullet Cluster was observed to exhibit gravitational lensing that evidently doesn't result from baryonic matter. It proposes that a function of unknown form denoted “mu of a over a-zero,” which approaches unity if the ratio is much greater than one, alters the law of physics traditionally used to calculate force. Proposed by Mordehai Milgrom to solve the problem of galactic rotation, for 10 points, identify this theory that is an alternative to Dark Matter.

answer: {“Monadology”}

At one point in this work, its author contrasts the laws of efficient causes with those of final causes and ultimately concludes that they must be in harmony. Its discussion of the means by which God obtains the greatest variety possible is followed by a reference to the work of Jerome Rorarius. Its final section discusses the role of pure love and the construction of a perfect government under God the architect. Composed of 90 sections, it has numerous parts devoted to the attainment of sensitivity by animals and humans, so that their spermatic animalcules may progress to the rank of reason. First published in 1714, Christian Wolff's doctrines would draw upon this work's discussion of entelechies or simple substances, as well as its author's previous treatise, The Theodicy.

answer: DNA {polymerases} [accept {DNA polymerase III} before “{Cdc28}”]

Overproduction of the epsilon subunit of one of these proteins counteracts the SOS response generated to nalidixic acid, while the epsilon subunit of a different one of these proteins is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. The idling turnover reaction is catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of a third protein in this class, and a homolog of that fragment in a certain bacteria is called Klentaq. The delta subunit of these proteins complexes with PCNA and Rfc to form a complex that kicks out a complex containing the alpha subunit after a primer is formed. For 10 points, name this class of proteins that add nucleotides to the leading and lagging strands of DNA during DNA replication.

Key reconnaissance for this battle was done by Lieutenant Colonel Sir Redvers Buller. Prior to this battle, Evelyn Wood's forces were renamed the Flying Column. Garnet Wolseley was supposed to replace the leader of the British in this battle, and it was started to delay that turnover. Shortly before this battle, the son of Napoleon III, Louis, was killed by the eventual losers, angering Lieutenant General Lord Chelmsford. The winners in this thirty-minute battle approached its site through the White Mfonzi valley, and they pursued the ruler of the losing side after destroying his royal Kraals, partially out of revenge for losses suffered at Isandlwana. For 10 points, name this 1879 battle that resulted in the capture and exile to England of Cetshwayo, the decisive battle of the Anglo-Zulu War.

answer: The {Death} of {General Wolfe}

Its artist interviewed some of the principals in preparation for this painting, which features a cloudy, dark sky on the upper right side of the canvas. On the left a man in a Green coat and a sash made out of beads bends towards the central group. Another figure's embroidered hat lies in front of him as he clenches his fists, while another man clutches a large flag. Completed two years after its artist's more conventional depiction of Agrippina Landing at Brundisium, the artist defended his decision to depict “the modern garb of war.”This, however, did not exclude its artist from taking historical license, for neither the wounded Robert Monckton nor the pensive and crouching American Indian were there when the titular event occurred. For 10 points, identify this 1770 painting that depicted a certain British commander being killed at the Battle of Quebec, a work by Benjamin West.

In addition to his early Cantiques spirituelles, this author created a character who decides to go to bed in his judge's robes one evening, and later he is put to sleep by the impassioned arguments another character makes defending Citron, a dog that had eaten a chicken. That character, Dandin, tries to climb out a window to go to court in this author's only comedy, which closes with the marriage of Leandre and Isabelle. In another play by this author, Roxane attempts to marry the title character in order to dethrone Amurat. This author of some biblically inspired works about Esther and Athalia wrote the plays The Litigants and Bajazet. He also wrote about a character who is urged to murder another by Hermione, who then betrays him, explaining that she'd been distraught that Pyrrhus had wanted to marry the title character. Another of his plays is about a character whose love for Aricie leads him to declare that he will leave Troezen, only for his stepmother to fall in love with him.

Ortony, Clore, and Collins developed a computational model of these phenomena. Rosalind Picard is a leading proponent of programming computers to recognize these phenomena. According to Solomon and Corbit's opponent-process theory, these phenomena disrupt homeostasis and are inversely proportional to their opposites. Robert Plutchik constructed a "wheel" of these entities and argued that they evolved biologically, in contrast to Carroll Izard, who thought they were hardwired into humans and identified ten major ones. Based on his studies of the Fore tribesmen, Paul Ekman argued for six universal ones. According to the Cannon-Bard model, these phenomena precede physiological reactions. They arise from the combination of arousal and cognition according to the two-factor theory developed by Singer and Schachter. For 10 points, identify these phenomena, examples of which include anger and joy.

Columbanus stressed its importance concerning commotions of the mind, while in The History of Sexuality, Michel Foucault wrote that this practice is imbued with relations of power and that its goal is submission rather than freedom. Its early adherents include John Chrysostom, who discusses it as an earthly manifestation of Christ in his On the Priesthood, and Tertullian, who argued for selective applications of it. In Lamentabili Sane, Pius X condemned the theory that it was a modern development, tracing its origins to the Book of John, via the Council of Trent.

Three times in this work, the music suddenly stops. Its second movement introduces a gentle oboe solo, while it opens with an orchestral depiction of an urban landscape which is interrupted by a clarinet solo and the beginning of a group of sections that its creator identified as “decoy games.” Its composer was inspired to begin this work while reading Menyhert Lengel's namesake tale, in which a young girl is forced to wave at passersby from a window. In this musical adaptation, it is the girl's seductive dancing that results in the quick robbery of an old rake and a young man, which occurs before three loud trombone crashes symbolize the entrance of a more formidable, foreign character. Written on the heels of its composer's The Wooden Prince, cymbals mark the three consecutive unsuccessful attempts on the titular figure's life.

According to NMR relaxation experiments, its Hamiltonian consistently dominates the ZFS Hamiltonian, and it may on rare occasions be observed along with a diamagnetic shift. David Akers established that its occurrence in dyonium explains away what appeared to be a magnetic monopole. Its molecular form occurs in diatomic molecules at sunspot-like temperatures and results in antisymmetric Stokes profiles, while its incomplete form occurs when the eigenvalues of a certain matrix cross each other instead of spreading linearly. Only occurring when the orbital and spin contributions to angular momentum cannot be considered coupled because the spin-orbit interaction is dwarfed by the magnitude of the external magnetic field, for 10 points, identify this strong-field variant of the Zeeman effect.

Two generalizations of its continuous formulation are related by a Weitzenböck identity, while the discrete version of this operation evaluated on a graph vertex sums the difference between the function value at that vertex and all of its nearest neighbors. Under conditions of chemical equilibrium, it vanishes when applied to the density of a quantity like concentration, and a generalization of it is found in a relativistic version of the Schrödinger equation, the Klein-Gordon equation.
