One character in this work shouts, "Kills! Kills! Kills! Kills! Kills!" after a bombing kills thousands at a city block, and a Marxist claims that "Guilt is a sociological accident" in Scene 9. It is written in unrhymed four-stress lines. In it, six-year old Rebecca is raped and killed by a teenage drug addict and left in an alley holding onto her parasol. Scene 8 of this work occurs in the aftermath of a nuclear attack. A balloon seller and popcorn seller are the first characters to appear in this work, and two drunken soldiers inform the title character that his son David was killed by his fellow soldiers in a pointless accident after the end of the war. Mr. Zuss and Nickles portray God and Satan in this work, and Sarah leaves the title character after he refuses to curse God. For 10 points, name this work of Archibald MacLeish, which was based on the Book of Job.

answer: {Andrea del Verrocchio}

This artist created a bronze candle stick for the Palazo della Signoria, while Lucrezia Donati was the subject of his Woman With a Primrose. Other works by this man include a painting that features two children in white kneeling in front of Saint Monica and a bust of Alexander the Great, in ancient armor, that was given as a gift to the King of Hungary. The relative lack of Christian imagery in his work is particularly notable in his porphyry and marble tomb of Piero and Giovanni de Medici at the Church of San Lorenzo, though his only surviving metal work is The Beheading of John the Baptist. Although the Villa Careggi is home to his bronze Putto with a Dolphin, his greatest work was originally placed in the Piazza San Marco in Venice and depicted a noted condotierro on horseback. For 10 points, name this sculptor of the Equestrian Monument of Colleoni, whose painting Baptism of Christ was created with his student, Leonardo da Vinci.

answer: Battle of the {Boyne}

It was somewhat overlooked in its time due the naval Battle of Beachy Head, which occurred at the same time. A large amount of troops here were separated from each other by a deep ravine near Roughgrange, a landform that neither side knew existed. That mistake cost the losing side its cannons. The actual fighting broke out at Oldbridge, where George Walker and the second-in-command of the winning side, the Duke of Shomberg, were killed. The Dutch Blue Guard managed to force its way across this battle's namesake feature. The winning side had the help of infantry from the region of Ulster known as Inniskillingers, while much of the losing army in this battle had been raised by Richard Talbot, First Earl of Tyrconnel in an attempt to reclaim the landholdings lost by Catholics in Ireland during the event which this battle prevented from being reversed, the Glorious Revolution. For 10 points, name this 1690 battle that took place in Ireland, in which William III of England crushed the former James II near the namesake river.

answer: {osmotic pressure}

Along with the reflection coefficient, this is the only variable to appear in both of the Kedem-Katchalsky equations. For a polymer gel, it is roughly equal to the temperature over the cube of the mesh size. A nonlinear increase in this property is sometimes due to the Gibbs-Donnan effect, and Alexander et al defined it as the negative partial derivative of the free energy with respect to volume with a fixed number of macroions. Alfred Gilman related this property to the voluntary intake of water in humans, showing that it does not increase until its value for a solution of urea is greater than that of a solution of salt. It is directly proportional to the ideal gas constant, temperature, and concentration by the Morse equation, and Einstein related it to the molecular theory of heat. For 10 points, name this colligative property, a gradient in which causes water to flow across a semipermeable membrane, which is dependent on the van't Hoff factor.

answer: {Donald Davidson}

This thinker pointed to a "third dogma of empiricism," which distinguishes sensory components, in his "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme." In another work, he posited an example of a beautiful garden as proof that desire in the mind of one person may be transferred to another, without compromising rationality. He adopted G.E.M. Anscombe's idea of “under a description” in his first major publication, which argued that certain behaviors may be understood as intentional or unintentional depending on the context. That work, "Actions, Reasons, and Causes," was completed after his Decision-Making: An Experimental Approach. His works deployed what he called “radical interpretation,” which focuses on how human beings understand language from scratch. For 10 points, name this former Berkeley philosopher who expounded on his contention that the mind cannot be reduced to physical elements, an idea known as “anomalous monism,” in works like Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation.

answer: {Gauss}' law [of {electricity}; do not accept “{Gauss's law} of {magnetism}”]

Rossi and Testa noticed an inconsistency between it and the canonical commutation relations, and a pure-glue form of it was implemented to apply to both gluons and quarks by Chen and Belloni. In theories of quantum gravity, this law implies that the total energy-momentum density at every point in space vanishes, and it is non-linear in QCD, while in QED it can be implemented by choosing wave functions that are dependent only on the transverse parts of the vector potential. In its gravitational form, it can be re-written as the Poisson equation by replacing the gravitational field with the gravitational potential. It can be used to demonstrate the safety of a Faraday cage, and in the case of stationary charges it is equivalent to Coulomb's law. The first of Maxwell's equations, for 10 points, name this physical law that states the total electric flux out of a closed surface is equal to the charge divided by the permittivity.

answer: {Zanj} Revolt

This event was centered in the city of al-Mukhtare, and many of the people involved in this event had been imported for the back-breaking work of clearing out the marshes in the Tigris River basin. The leader of this movement adopted the position of the Kharajites in saying that leadership should be based on abilities and not on heredity, but only after his own claims of descent had been disproved. It allowed the existence of an independent Egypt for its length and originated around the salt mines in the city of Basra, which was besieged for fifteen years by this movement. Its leader claimed descent from Caliph Ali ibn Abu Talib; that leader, Ali ibn Muhammed, had befriended some of the slaves under Caliph al-Muntasir and incited an earlier, short-lived rebellion in Bahrain. For 10 points, name this massive ninth-century revolt of some 500,000 African slaves against the Abbasid Empire.

This deity is aided and attended by seven wise men called the Abgal. One myth concerning this god involves Shukaletuda's rape of another deity, and he fulfills his role as judge and mediator of disputes by defusing the situation. Sometimes depicted while holding the half-bird, half-man, Zu, this god once lost track of his divine powers, known as the Me, while drunk, and had to use demons created out of the dirt under his fingernails to track them down in the city of Uruk. His consorts included Ki and Ninhursag and his main center of worship was at the Abzu Temple in Eridu. This cleverest of the gods warned mankind of Enlil's flood and helped his son defeat Tiamat.

Prominent historians who wrote about this event include Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay. Raymond-Roger de Trencevel was heavily involved in its early stage; that period saw the city of Bezier completely obliterated and the residents of Carcassone forced to strip naked before leaving the city. During this event, a commander died when ammunition from a mangonel allegedly manned by women crushed his head at the siege of Toulouse. In addition to the death of the elder Simon de Montfort, this event led to the marriage of Louis IX's son when Blanche of Castile signed a treaty that gave Raymond of Toulouse control of much of southern France in exchange for fighting in this conflict. It was prompted by the murder of papal legate Pierre de Castlenau shortly after the excommunication of Raymond. Innocent III promised the land of the target group to anyone willing to fight.
