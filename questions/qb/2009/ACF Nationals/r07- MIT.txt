answer: {Safavid} Dynasty

One ruler of this dynasty negotiated the Peace of Amasya with a western neigbhor. A later leader hired Sir Robert Sherley, who restructured the army into the divisions of ghulams, tofongchis, and topchis. This dynasty came to power by defeating the Ak Koyunlu, or White Sheep, and, after it won the Battle of Merv, this dynasty's founder used Shaibani's skull as a goblet. Shortly before its fall, this dynasty's capital was seized by Mahmud Khan, the leader of the Ghilzai; earlier, Selim the Grim had captured another of this dynasty's capitals by winning the Battle of Chaldiran. Its court at Esfahan was established by Shah Abbas I, while its founder ruled from Tabriz as Ismail I and came to power with the backing of the Qizilbash. For 10 points, name this dynasty which made Iran a Shia state and was ultimately overthrown in 1736 by Nadir Shah and the Afsharids.

answer: The Adventures of {Tintin} [or {Les Aventures} de {Tintin}]

One polity featured in this series remembers the fourteenth-century defeat of Baron Staszrvitch with the motto, “Eih bennek, eih blavek.” That place uses Cyrillic orthography but has a language closely resembling the Marols dialect of French. Mineral water near Klow and uranium around Sprodj figure into this series, which at one points depicts an elaborate plot by the Iron Guards to depose King Muskar XII in favor of Müsstler, the dictator of Borduria. King Ottokar's Sceptre is protected by the title character during an adventure in Syldavia, while his other adventures often involve the detectives Thomson and Thomson, the near-deaf Professor Calculus, or a man with a repertoire of nonsensical insults, Captain Haddock. For 10 points, name this comic series created by Hergé in which the dog Snowy also tags along with the namesake teenage Belgian reporter.

answer: {Gustave Courbet}

His landscapes include The Valley of the Loue in Stormy Weatherand The Torrent, which depicts a stream in the Jura mountains. He painted a young woman nodding off at the wheel in The Sleeping Spinner, while Meyer Schapiro suggested that he was influenced by images d'Epinal, prints circulated in the countryside, in an essay on this man and “popular imagery.” That influence can be seen in the frieze-like composition of Enterrement and in his self-styling as the Wandering Jew in The Meeting. An extrovert, he depicted himself in numerous works such as Self-portrait with a dog and Self-portrait as a desparate man. He created a painting of two naked women cavorting in Sleep and he called his close-up of Jo Hiffernan's genitals The Origin of the World. Two young girls play next to a man sitting on a step in a portrait of his friend Proudhon, who also appears along with Champfleury, George Sand, and himself, in a huge painting subtitled An Allegory of the Last Seven Years of My Artistic Life. For 10 points, name this painter of The Artist's Studio and The Stonebreakers.

answer: {magnesium} cation [or {Mg2+} or {Mg++}]

The cobalt ion is a competitive inhibitor of the CorA system for transporting this ion across cell membranes. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are thought to work by displacing this ion in the active site of the hammerhead ribozyme. In yeast, a defect in MSR2, which transports this ion into the mitochondria, leads to abnormal RNA splicing. Unlike the AMPA receptor, the NMDA receptor is blocked by this ion, and its voltage-dependent removal allows a similarly-shaped ion to enter the cell. This ion also functions as a cofactor for DNA polymerases, so its chloride salt is added to PCR mixtures. For 10 points, name this divalent cation at the center of the porphyrin ring in chlorophyll.

answer: The {Second Sex}

This work quotes Montaigne on how much easier it is to accuse than to excuse and Engels on the shift from a regime based on community ownership to one on private property; a shift which its author claims coincided with the application of tools, the domination of nature, and subsequent social differentiation.This work asserts that the determinism of psychoanalysis must be rejected in Part I, which is divided into three chapters, “Biology,” “Psychology,” and “History.”Part II, On the Master Slave Rebellion, argues for an existentialist perspective to understand how the supremacy of one group developed.Its Introduction disputes the nominalism of Dorothy Parker's contemporary call for equality and outlines this work's true goal, which is to explore how the concept of “the eternal feminine evolved.” For 10 points, identify this book that posited the evolution of woman as “the other,” a 1949 work by Simone de Beauvoir.

answer: Republic of the {Philippines} [or Republika {ng Pilipinas}]

A Communist group in this country once assassinated the chairwoman of its Red Cross because she was the widow of a detested former president. Forces of this country, which was the subject of the Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation, were killed during an outnumbered stand at the Battle of Tirad Pass after a constitution for this country was ratified at the Malolos Congress. A war fought in this country saw one general order "kill everyone over the age of ten" and lingered on as the Moro Rebellion. This country was also the site of the Balangiga Massacre, during a war in which the Taft Commission acted as its legislature. The Tydings-McDuffie Act made this country independent, over thirty years after the Macabebe Scouts acted at Palanan to help Frederick Funston capture Emilio Aguinaldo. For 10 points, name this country which rebelled for independence, first against Spain and then against the United States, decades before it was ruled by Ferdinand Marcos.

answer: Alexander {Borodin}

This composer's works for piano include a Fantasia on a theme of Hummel as well as the songs “The Pretty Girl No Longer Loves Me” and “The Sea Princess.” This composer relied extensively on syncopation and dotted rhythms in his Symphony No. 1, in E flat major. In another work, composed in D major, this composer represented himself as the cello and his wife Ekaterina as the first violin. That piece, the second of his two string quartets, preceded this man's Petite Suite, which was edited and orchestrated by Glazunov. Although he died before he could complete a third symphony, he did finish a certain “musical picture,” for the anniversary of Alexander II, that sought to depict a caravan moving across the deserts of an exotic title location. For 10 points, identify this composer of the Polovtsian Dances, Prince Igor, and In the Steppes of Central Asia.

answer: William Dean {Howells}

In one of this man's novels, Evelith Strange must decide whether to leave her social position for love and whether to accompany Aristides back to his home country. In another, Angus Beaton loves Alma Leighton, who is his rival for the position of illustrator. In addition to writing about what would happen before the “real grasshopper” could be appreciated, this man is responsible for such works as The Lady of the Aroostook and The Minister's Charge. Another of his works sees a one-armed socialist beaten to death by police and Conrad killed by an errant bullet while trying to intervne. He also wrote a novel in which Ben Halleck is unsure of whether he should propose and Marcia retreat to her father's home in Equity, Maine, following the escape to Arizona of Bartley Hubbard. This man also wrote about Basil March publishing the magazine “Every Other Week” during a streetcar strike and the love triangle between Tom Corey and the sisters Irene and Penelope Lapham. For 10 points, name this author of A Modern Instance, A Hazard of New Fortunes, and The Rise of Silas Lapham.

answer: Treaty of {Karlowitz}

This treaty led to a sixteen-year period in which Venice controlled the Peloponnese, and it compelled Poland to withdraw from Moldavia. The Hungarian nationalist Imre Thököly was deposed as prince in the wake of this treaty. Its Russian portion was supplemented in the following year by a treaty which transferred Azov, and it exempted an area defined by the Tisza, Mure?, and Danube rivers, the Banat of Temesvár, from one provision. In addition to the namesake town and the surrounding region of Vojvodina, Transylvania and Hungary also changed hands under this agreement, sixteen months after Eugene of Savoy's victory over Mustafa II at the Battle of Zenta. For 10 points, name this agreement signed between the Austria-led Holy League and the Ottoman Empire, who lost territory, in 1699.

answer: {aquifers}

These entities are described by the Dupuit assumption, which says that they are characterized by horizontal transport. That assumption can be used to develop the steady-state Thiem equation for these systems, which relates their transmissivity to their specific storage, but is less useful than the non-equilibrium Theis equation. Their pressure properties can be tested using straddle packers, and the perched variety of these occur in an area known as the vadose zone. Prominent examples of these include the Guarani and the Floridan, and their cross-sectional area can be multiplied by conductivity in a key application of Darcy's Law, often used to describe the confined type of these, which are surrounded by two impermeable layers. Bounded by a piezometric surface, for 10 points, name these beds of rock which store groundwater for wells.

answer: ({Georg Friedrich}) {Bernhard Riemann}

This man is the namesake of a formula relating the Euler characteristics of two surfaces when one is a ramified covering of the other with Hurwitz. He names a theta function whose expansion begins with a t over 2 log of t over 2 pi term together with Siegel, with whom he also names a formula approximating his namesake function. With Christoffel, he names a curvature tensor which is central in his namesake geometry, where all tangent spaces feature smooth inner products. With Roch, he names a theorem giving the dimensions of certain spaces of meromorphic functions, and the fact that any open set can be holomorphically mapped to the unit disk is his namesake mapping theorem. Also naming the conjecture that a certain function has no zeroes with real part one half, for 10 points, identify this German mathematician with a namesake zeta function and hypothesis.

answer: {Seventh} Day {Adventist}({s}) (accept reasonable equivalents; prompt on “{Millerites}”)

Clorinda Minor took a group of them to Jerusalem, while Joshua Vaughn Himes helped to popularize their beliefs in publications including The Voice of the West and Signs of the Times.Their beliefs originated with the founder's experience of a miracle at the Battle of Plattsburg and a series of sixteen articles in the Vermont Telegraph, where its founder discussed his rooted interpretation of prophecy by citing such books as Numbers 14:34. Featuring such leaders as Joseph Bates and Ellen White, they met at Albany after incorrectly predicting that, according to Daniel 8:14, a new millennium would begin on October 22, 1844, an event that never happened and has subsequently been called “The Great Disappointment.” For 10 points, identify this religious denomination founded by William Miller that believes in the imminent second coming of Christ on a certain day of the week.
