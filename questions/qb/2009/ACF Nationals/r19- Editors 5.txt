answer: The {Three Philosophers}

An estate surrounded by woods can be seen in the background of this work, which was commissioned by Taddeo Contarini and also features a fig tree in the foreground. Previous names for this painting include “figures” and, more in line with the current name, “geometers and mathematicians.”One of its subjects wears an ornate gold necklace, red robe, and a turban, while another, seemingly the oldest, holds a parchment which he may have removed from his gold cloak. Although the rocky path on the left is well lit, much of the canvas is taken up by dark cave that beckons the youngest of the title figures, who is seated and holds compass and a slate in his hands. Owned by the same family that purchased its artist's previous work, The Tempest, for 10 points, identify this 1506 work by Giorgione featuring the titular number of thinkers.

answer: The {Murders} in the Rue {Morgue}

About halfway into this work, the narrator is instructed to recall the lead actor's height in a contemporary production of Crebillon's Xerxes by a gentleman he once met in a library at the Rue Montmartre. It compares the skills needed to succeed at chess with those required by whist and, at one point, reproduces a full excerpt from the Gazette des Tribunaux. It begins with a quote from Thomas Browne asserting that even the most puzzling questions are not beyond all conjecture and ends with a visit to the Prefect to secure the release of Adolphe Le Bon, who had been apprehended near the scene at Quartier St. Roch. It is through a process its author dubs “ratiocination” that the protagonist determines who was responsible for the mangled corpses of a mother and daughter named L'Espanaye. While the story features a bevy of witnesses who attest to the culprit's nationality, the protagonist deduces that the true killer at the house on the titular street was a recently captured Orangutan. For 10 points, identify this 1841 short story that featured the debut of the detective C. Auguste Dupin, a work by Edgar Allan Poe.

answer: {B}-{Tree} [or {B Minus} Tree]

The Tetris Algorithm can be used to perform a range query on the universal type of these data structures, which make use of a Z Order Curve. A function which compares only the first k bits of data can be used to implement the space-saving prefix type of these data structures, while the regular type places elements to the left and right of a median node during the split portion of data insertion. A. A. Toptsis developed a variant of this data structure which increased the density of certain components within it to two thirds from another variant's one half, the so called star variety. In that latter variant, records are only stored at the leaf level, that is, the plus variety of this data structure, which is used to implement the NTFS file system. Developed by Ed McCreight and Rudolf Bayer, it is a more generalized form of a 2-3 tree. For 10 points, name this data structure, a type of self-balancing tree often used to implement databases.

answer: {Drogheda} [or {Droichead Átha}]

This city's position at the midpoint of two bridges four miles apart, Oldbridge and Bewley, enabled its defenders to protect its curtain walls as well as the West Gate and St. Lawrence Gate from Phelim O'Neill during the Eleven Years War.

answer: {Pockels} effect [or {electro}-{optic} effect]

The 18-coefficient tensor used for calculations of this effect can be simplified to 4 independent values if Kleinman symmetry is present, and it is most complex in the case of triclinic crystals. This effect allows perovskite to be used for photon-induced electric field poling and can also be used as a shutter for Q switching in a laser. Cells that utilize this effect are most often created with potassium dehydrogenated phosphate or lithium niobate. Those cells will cause polarization rotation if they are not aligned parallel or perpendicular to the light beam, and are used in voltage-controlled retarders. For 10 points, identify this effect in which an electric field creates a linearly proportional birefringence, unlike the similar but quadratically proportional Kerr Effect.

answer: {caspases} [or {cysteine}-{dependent aspartases}]

The Omi/HtrA2 and DIABLO families of proteins binds to enzymes that inhibit these proteins, one of which processes the transcription factor SATB1 in activated T cells. Abnormally high concentrations of one of them are found in polycystic kidney disease, and two others cleave the huntingtprotein in Huntington's disease. Granzyme B activates multiple proteins in this family. One of them is recruited by FADD, and another by a cytochrome c/Apaf-1 complex. Numbers 8 and 9 are the “initiators” of their namesake cascade, which occurs at the death-induced signaling complex. CED-3, which performs their function in C. elegans, is a homolog of ICE, or number 1 of these enzymes. For 10 points, name these proteases that play a critical role in apoptosis.

answer: {ergosphere}

The Blandford-Znajek process can only occur in this area, and plasmas in this region will generate Alfven waves that emit energy outward via the Poynting flux. Superradiance is the spontaneous emission of positive-energy photons in this region, and, under certain conditions, negative phase velocity propagation can occur here. One interpetation of this defines it as the area in which it is impossible for a particle to move on an integral curve of a Killing vector. Small relativistic jets can form in this area since it is undergoing the Lense-Thirring effect, and it only exists when a Kerr metric is present.

The Lucas critique argues that it cannot be used to predict the effects of a change in government economic policy. Construction of it may begin with a “cross” popularized by Alvin Hansen, for whom this model is sometimes named. The liquidity trap occurs if one of the curves in this model is nearly horizontal.
