answer: {Zaire} [or {Zara}]

Several secrets come to light in this play when a character remembers the burning of Caesarea. Chatillon laments that he has been freed but his king remains enslaved after a monarch is so impressed by the honor of a former captive in this play that he frees one hundred slaves upon receiving ransom for ten. The sultan ultimately orders Corasmin to free all the Christians before stabbing himself at the end. Misunderstandings began over a furtive letter sent by Nerestan, who learns that the title character is his sister and both are the children of Lusignan, the putative king of Jerusalem. For 10 points, name this play in which the title slave girl converts back to Christianity and ends her plans to marry Orosmane, a melodrama by Voltaire about the Crusades whose title figure once shared her name with an African country.

answer: George {Mason}

This man argued that all states should give up claims to western lands after accusing Governor Johnson of Maryland of trying to profit from recent land purchases made from Indians. A document written by this man said that slave importation was an "unnatural trade" and that "descendants not of the conquered, but of the conquerors" were speaking. In another document by this man, he praised "the great bulwarks of liberty" that "can never be restrained but by despotic governments" and stated "that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity toward each other." That document also outlined the "right to uniform government,” to bear arms, and to free speech. This master of Gunston Hall was the principal author of both the Fairfax Resolves and the Virginia Declaration of Rights, and thus refused to support the Constitution until a Bill of Rights was added. For 10 points, name this American independence figure who, due to his founding of Alexandria, became the namesake of a northern Virginia university.

answer: {Illuminations} [prompt on an answer like “{Benjamin's Essays}” or “{Essays} by {Benjamin}”]

One of this volume's pieces cites Kant's descriptions of gambling as “a vulgar appeal to experience.” It includes an analysis of Russian culture's debt to Origen, as well as an assertion that Marx was basically rewriting Eugene Sue, but the most peculiar piece ends with an appreciation of Spitzweg's painting The Bookworm and is titled “Unpacking My Library.” While the editor's note apologizes for the exclusion of the piece entitled “Karl Kraus,” this first translation of its author's works into English featured an introduction by Hannah Arendt that commented on his un-dialectical approach and reflected on his interest in the figure of the flaneur. Containing such essays as “Theses on the Philosophy of History” and “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” for 10 points, identify this most well known collection of essays by Walter Benjamin.

answer: {cracking} [accept {catalytic cracking}; prompt “{refining petroleum}” and equivalents]

Some now-defunct ways to achieve this action include the Rittman process and the Gyro process. The Alchlor process was an alternative to the expensive McAfee batch process to do this, which pioneered the use of aluminum chloride. The once commonly-employed Burton process was modified by the impact route and an innovation by Clark which connected stills in series to form batteries. Those methods were all supplanted by Eugene Houdry, who developed the first fixed-bed method for this, though more common today are fluid-bed or moving-bed procedures. Charles Plank and Edward Rosinski developed the first useful zeolite in this process, and natural and synthetic zeolites often serve as catalysts in the riser-type reactor employed in this process. For 10 points, name this procedure by which complex heavy hydrocarbons are broken down into lighter molecules, important in refining petroleum.

answer: The {Eureka Stockade} [or {Eureka Uprising}, etc]

A few months before this event, tensions were inflamed when the politically connected James Bentley was acquitted of a murder. Proponents of this event used slogans such as “no property qualifications” and “annual goddamn elections,” and many participants had been involved three years earlier in the Forest Creek Monster Meeting. This conflict turned violent with the murder of James Scobie, which prompted the Peter Lalor-led “diggers” to form the Ballarat Reform League. The roots of this conflict were in the “licensing fees” introduced by lieutenant governor Charles La Trobe. For 10 points, identify this 1854 standoff named for the hastily constructed fort of the gold miners, twenty of whom were shot after agitating for reforms in the colony of Victoria.

The hydroelectric plants of Silver and Kakabeka Falls power the industrial landscape of this city. The early photosynthesizers represented by the Gunflint Fossils were first collected in the environs of the city by this name, which was previously known as Fort William when the headquarters of the North West Company were moved here from Grand Portage. Another feature by this name forms a coastline on Sibley Provincial Park and is the destination of the Current and Kaninstiquia Rivers. The home to Lakehead University, the city of this name absorbed Port Arthur in 1970 and is found about thirty miles northwest of Isle Royale. For 10 points, name this Ontario city which shares its name with the inlet of Lake Superior that it overlooks.

answer: “The {Kraken}”

A parody of this poem mentions that "the PRB must keep the shady side" and is about a figure who is "getting his pictures, like his supper, cheap;" that parody was written by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Though it has fifteen lines, this poem otherwise is structured as a Petrarchan sonnet. Its placement of the title figure at Judgment Day is possibly based on the forty-second line of the first book of Paradise Lost. The title entity “hath lain for ages” and “will lie until the latter fire shall heat the deep,” when he will “once by man and angels” “be seen.” This poem describes the “ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep” of a creature that is covered in “sponges of millenial growth and height” and is “battening upon huge seaworms” as “enormous polypi winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.” For 10 points, name this poem by Tennyson, set “far far beneath in the abysmal sea,” about a legendary monster.

answer: {Halting} problem or {HaltTM}

This problem is a type of membership problem, and, by formulation as a dynetic decision problem, it is neurally solvable. Rice's theorem was proven as a result of this, and Chaitin's constant is also sometimes named as this problem's probability. This problem is sometimes stated as a form of Hilbert's second problem. The first proof of this problem's undecidability, as well as that of the Decision problem, was published by Turing in a paper where he defined the Turing machine. One method of proving a quality on this problem relies on Cantor's theorem and the diagonalization of the results on input of a sequence of Turing machines. For 10 points, name this problem of determining whether a program and a certain input will run forever or finish.

answer: {Myrrha} [accept {Smyrna} before it is {said}]

Although this figure attempted to commit suicide by hanging, an old nursemaid saved this figure and, during the Festival of Ceres, helped to coordinate the central event in this figure's life. According to one story, the patriarch of this figure's family, who had sent Agamemnon a beautiful breastplate before the Trojan war, killed himself after losing a lyre playing contest to Apollo. That death occurred after this figure was chased away from Cyprus and ended up at Sabo. As punishment for not performing her rites, the goddess of love had caused this daughter of Cenchreis and Cinyras to lust after her father. That incestuous union ultimately resulted in the birth of a child, who was initially placed in a box, but grew up to become Aphrodite's lover. Also known as Smyrna, for 10 points, identify this tragic mythological figure who gave birth to Adonis after the gods had turned her into a namesake tree.

answer: {Hyundai} Motor Company [or {Hyundai} Kia {Automotive Group}]

An episiode of Top Gear clocked one of this company's flagship models as taking nineteen seconds to go from zero to sixty. In 2008, this company began phasing out its supermini model, which is not sold in the United States; both the i20 and a new electric version will replace the engine-driven Getz. This firm entered the international market with the Pony following a technology-sharing agreement with Ford that enabled it to develop assembly lines for the Cortina. Its first American car was the highest-selling debut import in history, the Excel, which was rebadged as the Mitsubishi Precis. This manufacturer of the Santa Fe SUV purchased Kia in 1998, giving it an eighty percent share of the South Korean market. For 10 points, name this automaker whose models include the Accent, Elantra, and Sonata.

answer: {Rayleigh}-{Taylor} instability

This process resembles the resistive ballooning mode of magnetized plasmas except the plasma pressure replaces rho. In this process, penetration distance is proportional to the Atwood number and gravitational acceleration, and the sonoluminescent bubbles created by snapping shrimp are destroyed via this process. It can be seen in delamination of lithosphere layers and in carbon detonation within a type 1a supernova, in which it displays its characteristic "fingers". For 10 points, identify this configuration where a more dense fluid lies on top of a less dense one, resulting in instability.

answer: Thebes

This state aided the Thessalians in a war with Alexander of Pherae, defeating that tyrant at the less-heralded first Battle of Cynoscephalae. One military victory for this polity saw it deploy fifty ranks of troops on its left wing to match twelve for the opponent, inventing the "oblique order" to great success in a battle against Cleombrotus. Forces of this city orchestrated the Arcadians' founding of Megalopolis and reformed the state of Messenia after allying with a helot revolt in Sparta, but this polity, which was victorious at Tegyra, declined following the death of its greatest general at Mantineia. For 10 points, name this city which led the Boeotian League during the days of Pelopidas and Epaminondas and won at Leuctra before being defeated by Philip of Macedon at Chaeronea.

answer: {Rachmaninoff's Concertos} for {Piano}

One of these works finishes with a movement marked Alla breve that is preceded by a brief cadenza. Another, written while its composer was still a student, opens with portentous horn declarations and a cascade of chords meant to evoke the pealing of bells. Yet another one of them is prefaced by eight stark chords at the beginning and includes a soaring second theme in E flat. That piece, which featured an “Oriental” second subject later popularized by the song “Full Moon and Empty Arms,” was completed soon after the composer began visiting the hypnotist Nikolas Dahl. Although the first one remained unfinished, by 1909 the third and final one had been completed. For 10 points, identify this set of works for a certain instrument by the composer of The Isle of the Dead.

answer: {Roman Osipovich Jakobson}

This thinker noted that aphasia can occur across either the syntagmatic or paradigmatic axis, and can involve either word combination or vocabulary substitution. He postulated the Gesamtbedeutung and Grundbedeutung, or invariant and contextually specific meaning, of morphological constructs, which he used to analyze his native language's case system in terms of directionality, marginality, and quantification. This man came up with six functions of communication, including context and code, in his expansion of Karl Bühler's Organon-model. One of his theories, put forth in Preliminaries to Speech Analysis, states that each phoneme can be described by possessing or lacking certain qualities. For 10 points, name this creator of the distinctive features theory of phonology, who, along with people like René Wellek and Nicholas Trubetskoy, was a leader of the Prague School of Linguistics.

One character in this story annoys his family by spending his days at the home of La Blanche, while another discusses the cutting of fingernails with the turban-wearing Zandrine. While burning a layette and a velvet dress, that character finds a letter which thanks “the good God for having so arranged our lives.” The title character was abandoned at a pillar by some Texans who rode a canvas-covered wagon. Adopted by the Valmondes, that character later grows suspicious when she observes a quadroon using a fan, and later exiles herself into the swamp.

answer: {flow cytometry} [or {FCM}; or {Fluorescence}-{Activated Cell Sorting}; or {FACSTM} - {FACS} is the name of the trademarked technique, which is a specific kind of flow cytometry, so it's easier to just accept rather than "anti-prompt"]

In 2000, Sohn et al. described a variant of this technique that uses capacitance as an alternative to more traditional measurements. This technique often uses propidium iodide and Hoechst dyes, and one important technique associated with it is known as compensation. One type of this technique was developed by Leonard Herzenberg, and its acronym is trademarked by Becton Dickinson, a leading producer of devices used in it. This technique is based on the concept of hydrodynamic focusing, which produces a single file of droplets, and a photodiode detects forward and backward scatter caused by fluorescently-labeled objects inside the droplets. For 10 points, name this technique most often used to sort cells based on physical characteristics.

The original design included a statue of the Risen Christ, but this was later replaced by an orb and a cross. Its decorative details include lizards, vines, and a smattering of bees, in honor of its patron. Open tie rods connect two pairs of putti who lean over its front edge; one pair holds a book, while the other a set of keys. Originally conceived of by Carlo Maderno, its columns allow sight of another work by the same artist, the Cathedra Petri, a great gilt bronze chair. Rising at the cross section of the Latin Cross, more than 100 feet above the main altar, its dark, twisted, columns were derived from a set believed to have come from the Temple of Solomon. Commissioned by Urban VIII in 1623, for 10 points, identify this grand baroque canopy in St. Peter's Basilica, a work designed by Gianlorenzo Bernini.

answer: {Jerome Klapka Jerome}

In one of this author's novels, the title character is sent a ring by the "princess of the golden locks.” He wrote a play in which a cheap landlady passes off rotten veal as curry and a Jewish schemer tries to collect investments for a fictitious silver mine until a rhetorically gifted stranger arrives at the boarding house to moralize the inhabitants. In addition to Paul Kelver and The Passing of the Third Floor Back, he wrote about a man who remembers burying two malodorous cheeses on a beach in another novel. That man has every disease except housewife's knee and treats himself by eating a one-pound steak and a pint of beer every six hours. This author wrote of that man's journey from Kingston to Pangbourne with Harris and George, as well as Montmorency the dog, in a work that was followed by a story set “on the bummel.” For 10 points, name this English humorist who wrote Three Men in a Boat.

answer: {Carlsbad Decrees}

Due to the insistence that these acts be ratified within four days, a secret set of minutes was prepared which included the legislative objections on them, while the published minutes showed a unanimous, unquestioned vote. The next year, the legislature was stripped of debating privileges and allowed only to vote under the “Final Act,” which strengthened these laws. The idea for these acts was formulated during demonstrations at the Wartburg Festival. Their provisions included establishing a secret police at Mainz, empowering the confederation Diet to censor all periodicals, and dissolving the “youth associations” at Jena and other universities. A response to Karl Sand's murder of August Kotzebue, they were agreed to by eleven ministers at a meeting in Bohemia. For 10 points, identify these 1819 laws written by Metternich, which restricted liberal and nationalist groups in German lands.

Lesser known works associated with this movement include “Oriental” by Stanton Macdonald-Wright and Patrick Henry* Bruce's reconfigurations of still lifes. The magazine linked with this movement was called Montjoie! and its development was precipitated by the formation of the Puteaux Group. One of its proponents referred to it as “Simultaneity” and his early works include a series of images depicting a certain monument as seen through refracted light. That series of Eiffel Tower paintings was followed by such works as A Window and Circular Forms: Sun and Moon, which are examples of this art movement's underlying theory that “color alone is form and subject." Given its name by a 1912 Guillaume Appolinaire essay on cubism, Fank Kupka, Sonia Terk, and Jacques Villon, were all prominent members of, for 10 points, what art movement led by Robert Delaunay and named for a mythological singer.

This functional group is reduced in the Luche reaction. The Burgi-Dunitz angle is important in Anh's modification of the Felkin model, which involves the minimization of torsional strain of a transition state when molecules containing this functional group are nucleophilically attacked. If the desired product of a Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley reduction contains this functional group, then that reaction is known as the Oppenheimer oxidation. Molecules containing two of these functional groups are condensed in the Paal-Knorr synthesis, and one of its bonds is broken to form a betaine in the Wittig reaction. For 10 points, name this functional group that is attacked by a hydroxide ion in the Cannizzaro reaction and can be reduced to a hydroxyl group.
