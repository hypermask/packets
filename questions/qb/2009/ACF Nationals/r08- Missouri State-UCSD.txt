answer: {Preludes}

They include a piece interpolating a Neapolitan folksong, while another bases its rhythm on a Habanera in order to invoke a historic gate at the Alhambra. Still another uses a fragmented melody to depict a stark glacial landscape. That piece, the sixth of them, is marked “slow and sad.” Another one quotes “God Save the Queen” and is dedicated to Samuel Pickwick.Collected in two books, they were composed between 1909 and 1913 and include works with such titles as “The Hills of Anacapri,” “The Sunken Cathedral,” and “Girl with the Flaxen Hair.” Markedly shorter than this composer's previous works, like Three Nocturnes, their name derives from a type of music that would often begin a church service or introduce another work, like a fugue. For 10 points, identify this set of 24 pieces for piano, by Claude Debussy.

answer: {vowel harmony} [prompt on {assimilation} of {vowels}]

Haruo Aoki proposed three criteria for this and rejected two in an article entitled “Toward a Typology of” this, while a book by Martin Krämer on this feature describes some certain phonemes as Trojan, hybrid, opaque, or transparent. Arisaka's Laws indicate that Old Japanese may have had a form of this feature. Guaraní has a form analogous to this one with nasals, and Germanic umlaut was a weaker form of this phenomenon. It is often determined by height, backness, or roundedness of the phonemes at hand, and can occur progressively or regressively, often affecting suffixes, as in Hungarian. Estonian has notably lost this feature, while Finnish retains it, classifying /i/ and /e/ as neutral. Also present in Altaic languages like Turkish, for 10 points, name this feature of languages in which the vowels of a word assimilate to be only of one type.

answer: The {Shoemaker's Holiday}: A Pleasant Comedy of the Gentle Craft

This play was based on a Thomas Deloney tract which was the source for an “Epistle to the Professors” and which prefaced this work in its first edition. A boy in this play enters wearing an alderman's gown after one character mentions his dealings with Skellum Skanderbag. Another character grants command of his troops to Askew and returns disguised as the Dutchman Hans. Sir Roger Oteley, the mayor of London in this play, goes with the Earl of Lincoln to St. Faith's to disrupt the wedding of Jane and Ralph, and goes to Savoy only to be foiled by Simon Eyre, the title character. Shrove Tuesday is set aside as the title day, and the marriage of Rowland Lacy is recognized in, for 10 points, what play by Thomas Dekker about some cobblers?

answer: {South Sea Bubble}

It eventually forced the 3rd Earl of Sunderland, Charles Spencer, out of office. This event inspired the street ballad “Every fool aspired to be a knave” and drew comparison to the Trojan Horse by the second Earl Cowper. It involved a rumor of Earl Stanhope's reception of overtures. James Craggs and his son John were both tried for this event, and through a Parliamentary inquiry, John Aislabie was expelled for his involvement with it. Madam von Platen and the Duchess of Kendal's bribe-taking helped pass a measure by which the entity responsible for it assumed the British national debt. That entity, established by Robert Harley, excited Exchange Alley investors with its promise of abundant wealth with zero taxes from Philip V, despite being limited to one vessel after the Treaty of Utrecht. For 10 points, name this 1720 British speculation crisis.

answer: Niels Henrik {Abel}

By a special case of the projection-slice theorem, performing the Hankel transform is equivalent to performing this man's transform for axially symmetric functions along with Fourier's. The absolute value of the inner product of two vectors is bounded by an inequality named for this man, who sometimes names the formula for summation by parts. The equation of tetration is derived from this man's equation, which equates f(h(x)) with f(x+1), but he is better known for an identity linking the Wronskian of a second order differential equation to the equation itself and for an identity with Ruffini. Better known for proving that the general form of a quintic polynomial is insolvable, for 10 points, name this mathematician who names groups which are commutative, a Norwegian.

answer: {Alberto Giacometti}

This artist's earlier pieces, such as the marble Torso, emulated Fernand Leger, while this artist's last sitter was the photographer Elie Lotar. One of this artist's works depicts a woman sitting on a chair with her calves hidden from view, while the title feature of another one of this artist's subjects protrudes far outside the outline of a cage. In addition to Invisible Object and The Nose, this artist designed a notable set for a production of Waiting for Godot and completed numerous abstract portraits of his wife Caroline. Recently his animal sculpture Le Chat, one of eight bronze cats the artist sculpted in the early 1950s, was set to be auctioned off by Sotheby's. Another of his bronzes, subtitled Composition with Seven Figures and a Head, depicts a group of women as trees. That work, The Forest, as well as an earlier piece featuring four men walking, the City Square, depict this sculptor's characteristic elongation of the human figure. For 10 points, identify this Swiss creator of Palace at 4AM and Woman With her Throat Cut.

answer: Treaty of {Amiens}

Portugal did not attend the talks leading to this treaty, but later signed the Treaty of Madrid, a separate document. Robert Jenkinson, Lord of Liverpool, led negotiations on the British side, which were prompted by losses such as Hohenlinden. The Republic of the Seven Ionian Islands achieved recognition as a result of this treaty, and under it Egypt was taken from France and restored to the Ottoman Empire under British supervision. Additional terms of this agreement included Britain ceding overseas territorial gains except for Trinidad, Tobago, and Ceylon to France, France bringing a halt to advances in the Papal States, and Spain reclaiming the island of Minorca. For 10 points, name this treaty spurred by the Battle of Marengo and negotiated in 1802 among Joseph Bonaparte and Cornwallis, which ended hostilities between France and the Second Coalition.

answer: "On {Perpetual Peace}" or "{Zum Ewigen Frieden}"

In the second appendix to this work, the author discusses how the principle of publicity allows for an argument against the legitimacy of rebellions to depose tyrannical rule. That appendix, entitled “Of the Harmony Which the Transcendental Concept of Public Right Establishes Between Morality and Politics,” also contains a section in which the author argues that “All maxims which stand in need of publicity in order not to fail their end, agree with politics and right combined.” Among the articles outlined in Section 1 of this work are that treaties should not “tacitly reserve” future wars, states should not carry standing armies, and that states should not employ assassins against rulers of other states. Subtitled "A Philosophical Essay," for 10 points, identify this work that called for a confederation of nations as one of the conditions under which the title concept could be attained, a work by Immanuel Kant.

answer: {riboflavin} [or B2 before mentioned]

Kim and Min developed a method of destroying this compound by decomposing it into lumichrome, 2,3-butanedione, and another namesake compound. Coenzymes related to this compound complement cytochrome P-450 in certain metabolic reactions, and recent studies suggest that it can normalize lactate levels in patients with Complex I deficiencies. Deficiency of this vitamin can be detected by examining the relative activity of either xanthine oxidase or erythrocyte glutathione reductase, and its deficiency can lead to increased risk of both cancer of the esophagus and preeclampsia. Also confirmed to play a role in reducing the frequency of migraines, for 10 points, name this component of FAD and FMN, a water-soluble vitamin also known as B2.

answer: {Gibbs}-{Duhem} equation [prompt on partial answer]

Escobedo and de Pablo modified a type of “integration” introduced by Kofke that is derived from this equation. The Lewis-Randall rule can be used to relate Henry's Law to this statement, while it itself is derived by differentiating the Euler equation. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation follows directly from this relation. At constant temperature and pressure, its states that given multiple species in solution, the products of the number of moles of a species in solution and the derivative of that species' chemical potential will sum to zero. For 10 points, name this equation that shows that the intensive variables of a system are not independent, named after a man with an eponymous phase rule and a French scientist-philosopher.

Members of this group formed a namesake Twenty-Eighth Battalion during World War II. James Carroll was among the leaders of this people, and governor George Grey gave a seminal account of their language and culture. Toi, one semi-mythical leader of the people, is estimated to have lived around 1150 A.D. A subset of them founded a new culture on the Chatham Islands, and Frederick Maning wrote of his time spent with this ethnic group. Prior to their unification during the King Movement, this people was plagued by infighting among groups led by Pomare, Titore, and Te Wera, a series of conflicts known as the Musket Wars. William Hobson negotiated the most important agreement involving this people, among the conditions of which were the exclusive right of the British crown to purchase their land. That agreement was the Treaty of Waitangi. For 10 points, name these native people of New Zealand.
