answer: {Georgia} [or {Sak'art'velo}]

The printing press was introduced to this country by a learned king who issued a law code that prescribed blood payment as the penalty for every offense, Vakhtang VI of the Mukhranian dynasty. This country resisted the Mongols under the leadership of a king nicknamed “the Brilliant” after earlier rebelling against Persia under the leadership of Gorgasal and being Christianized by St. Nino. During its time as a client state of Byzantium, this country was ruled by the “kuropalates” or “guardian of the palace,” a title which Ashot the Great held before founding the independent Bagratid dynasty here. This country's current capital was incorporated into the state during the campaigns of David the Builder, and many of its lands were later conquered by Queen Tamar. For 10 points, name this state whose “Rose Revolution” elevated Mikhail Saakasvilli to power over Eduard Shevardnadze, and which was reconquered for the USSR by native son Joseph Stalin.

answer: {Boltzmann's} constant

According to the Stokes-Einstein relation, the Brownian diffusion of a particle under the influence of a chemical potential gradient is directly proportional to both temperature and this other value. The Kelvin scale is derived by multiplying the fundamental temperature by this value, and in the Eyring equation, it is divided by Planck's constant. The average kinetic energy of a gas is equal to 3/2 times temperature times this value. It multiplies the natural log of the microcanonical partition function to yield the entropy in an equation inscribed on its namesake's tombstone. For 10 points, name this constant that equals the gas constant divided by Avogadro's constant, often symbolized k.

answer: Herbert {Spencer}

He defended the utility of art and criticized the standard method of teaching the classics in his Education, Intellectual, Moral, and Physical. He debated Frederic Harrison in a series of articles later collected as The Nature and Reality of Religion and, in another work, argued that the uniformity of law depended on what he termed "the persistence of force." He argued that basic rights are natural in the sense that they give value to "customs" in a chapter called "The Great Political Superstition." That chapter was found in The Man Versus the State which was written after his First Principles laid out the basic foundations of his philosophical project including his "Development hypothesis." This man argued for universal suffrage in his first major work subtitled "The Conditions essential to Happiness specified, and the First of them Developed." That work was one of the first to apply the theories of Lamarck to society. For 10 points, identify this author of 1851's Social Statics, a British philosopher best known for coining the expression "survival of the fittest."

The tyrosine kinase Lck can become complexed to these molecules and triggers the phosphorylation of the serine specific protein kinase Raf-1. One class of these molecules functions as a mannose-6-phosphate receptor, and another is a polio virus receptor. Binding class 14 of these molecules may promote neural survival in Alzheimer's disease by reducing microglial activation. TCR signaling can be used to regulate the synthesis of these molecules, which are classified based on their recognition by and reactivity with specific monoclonal antibodies. A ratio of class 4 of these molecules to class 8 of these molecules helps track the progression of infection by HIV, as HIV's gp120 interacts with class 4 of these molecules to enter helper T cells. For 10 points, name these membrane bound glycoproteins, whose class 4 and class 8 recognize MHC antigens presented to helper and cytoxic T-cells, respectively.

This group sold bonds which were stamped as redeemable “six months after” a hypothetical event happened. Members of this group who were excluded from a prisoner exchange deal were the target of the Catalpa Rescue. Australian provincial governor Henry Parkes was convinced of a massive conspiracy by this group down under, taking as evidence the shooting of Prince Alfred during a visit to Sydney by a man falsely believed to belong to this organization. Founded by John Mahoney in 1858, this group was eventually absorbed into Clan Na Gael after its raids into Canada failed to provoke the intended Anglo-American war.

At this work's first performance, confusion resulted when groups of performers were positioned in different galleries where they could not see each other. The text used for this work had been previously set to music in 1660 by Henry Lawes. Its composer stated, “I have read my Bible very well and shall choose for myself” in response to the bishops' wish to assign him texts. Its middle section features the chorus repeating “Rejoice” over a dotted rhythm in the orchestra, and its opening section features the line “Nathan the Prophet anointed Solomon king”.

An algorithm of this type, developed by Matsumoto and Nishimura, failed the TestU01 Crush but passed the Diehard Tests for them. One of the best algorithms of this type hinges on the difficulty of solving the quadratic residuosity problem, and, like RSA, involves the product of two large prime numbers, the Blum Blum Shub algorithm. Another of these algorithms, which generally strive to prevent backtracking, was developed for the ENIAC by Johnny von Neummann and operated by taking a subsection of a squared number and then feeding the result back into the algorithm. Besides the middle-square method, another example is the Mersenne Twister, and they are often necessary for providing input to Monte Carlo algorithms. Often accepting a seed, for 10 points, name these algorithms which strive to produce numbers without patterns.

The king universally considered the greatest of this state was responsible for defeating the Gajapatis of Orissa and adding the Raichur Doab to this empire's territory. That king was given a glowing review by the Portuguese travel writer Domingo Paes, who wrote about this state. This state was ruled by the Saluva and Tuluva dynasties after its initial founding by the house of Sangama, including its first kings Bukka and Harihara. This polity's namesake capital was destroyed after its leader Rama Raya was killed by a four-sultan alliance during the Battle of Talikota. That began its final decline, during which it was ruled by Tirumala from the city of Penukonda. Ethnic Kannadas and Tamils were second-class citizens in this state, which was ruled by Telugus, and incorporated the preceeding Hoysala empire into its Hindu bulwark against the Muslim sultanates of the north.
