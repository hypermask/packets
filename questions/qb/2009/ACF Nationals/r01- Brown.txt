answer: {generator} [accept word forms, {e.g.} "{generates}," etc.]

In pattern theory, an object of this name is characterized by having attributes and bonds. In coding theory, the Golay code is an example of this kind of matrix, while an integer lacking a digit addition variety of one of these objects is called a self number. In a Banach space, an infinitesimal one is defined as the limit of a linear operator T of s minus the identity divided by s as s goes to zero. A Lie algebra defines the commutation relations obeyed by representations of these objects, and finite-dimensional Hermitian matrices can be used to represent those of a compact Lie group. In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator has this relation to rotations, and a group is called cyclic if some element in it has this relation to the group. For 10 points, identify this term which in group theory identifies an element whose products with itself give every element in the group.

answer: {adiabatic demagnetization} [or {magnetocaloric} effect]

The balloon-borne CMB experiment TopHat uses ferric ammonium alum in its implementation of this technique, which was first developed fully by William Giauque. In 1997, gadolinium alloys were used to discover a giant version of the effect which makes this technique possible, and in 2000, that same effect was discovered in Heusler alloys. The most common cycles utilized in this technique are the AMR, Ericsson, and Stirling cycles, and the effectiveness of this technique is limited by Nernst's Equation. Devices employing this technique typically utilize a salt pill with a high magnetic moment and the theory of this technique is derived by adding a B-dM term to the thermodynamic relation. For 10 points, identify this technique in which a change of the B-field at constant entropy results in a cooling.

Rachel DuPlessis argues that the rhythm of this poem subverts its own intellectual claim, even though the poet regarded the third section as hopeful. One group of people described in this poem have "bells on their ankles" and "pearls in their hair," while another part is intended to be read with "slow philosophic calm." The first part of this work relates how demons cut off the hands of a certain emperor's ghost in hell, and another section tells of a dance by "cake-walk princes." This work was inspired by the story of Ray Eldred as related by the author's pastor F.W. Burnham, and the speaker of this work sees the subject "cutting through... with a golden track." Parts of this poem were intended to be sung to the melody of "Hark, ten thousand harps and voices," and this poem ends with a drawn-out whisper of "Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you."

answer: Treaty of {Cateau}-{Cambresis}

The specific conflict which was ended by this treaty erupted following the violation of the Peace of Vaucelles three years before this treaty's signing, which occasioned a celebratory ode by Pierre de Ronsard. Emmanuel Philibert was able to recover most of his Savoyard possessions through a clause in this treaty, and one party to this agreement yielded control of Corsica to Genoa. Prior to signing this treaty, one monarch who was party to it sent a memorandum to his sister Joanna claiming that his presence in Flanders was necessary to prevent a possible invasion of England. The French position in negotiating this treaty was weakened by the signature four years earlier of the Peace of Augsburg, and Ruy Gomez de Silva was named Prince of Eboli for his services in negotiating this treaty, which was signed following Spanish victories at San Quentin, Arras, and Gravelines.

C.E.M. Joad argued that this work created an environment conducive to fascism. Its opening section contains a criticism of F.H. Bradley's interpretation of a statement by Wittgenstein and uses the example of a painting believed to be by Goya to illustrate its central problem. Its section on the "A Priori" rejects Mill's idea that the a priori originates from inductive generalizations, and this works's fifth chapter, partly concerned with probability, analyzes a statement about Queen Anne to advance a deflationary theory of one of its title concepts. The final section of this work argues that knowing the state of mind of the Emperor of Manchukuo is unnecessary to predict the weather and therefore dispenses with monism, while its famous sixth section contains an exposition of the emotivist theory of ethics. At the beginning of this work, the author expresses sympathy with the Viennese logical positivists, and it begins with a famous section dedicated to the "Elimination of Metaphysics." Most famous for promoting the principle of verifiability, for 10 points, identify this 1936 work by A.J. Ayer.

Rong and Golic used a linearized P-element construct and a heat-sensitive FLP system to adapt this process to Drosophila. A common version of this process uses gancyclovir or G418 as a counter-selection agent since the construct contains the HSV-tk gene, while positive selection is achieved using a neomycin resistance gene. This process usually begins with a transfection in an embryonic stem-cell line with the goal of creating an organism with an altered germline, and the “hit and run” strategy can perform replacement as well as this process. Capecchi, Evans, and Smithies won the 2007 Nobel Prize for developing this process, which also can be used to add transgenic constructs into a particular locus. For 10 points, name this process commonly used to remove specific genes using homologous recombination, often used to create a namesake type of mouse.
