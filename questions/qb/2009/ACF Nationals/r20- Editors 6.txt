answer: {hydrochloric} acid [or {HCl}; or {muriatic} acid]

A solution of this molecule is often used to extract impurities in the Kolbe nitrile synthesis. Limestone and dolomite are sometimes differentiated by applying a solution of this molecule to the rock, since dolomite will only react with it if powdered. Manganese dioxide reacts with this compound in the Weldon process, and the Alkali Act of 1863 required soda producers using the Leblanc process to absorb ninety-five percent of this byproduct. It is combusted in the Deacon process. The Lucas reagent consists of zinc chloride dissolved in a solution of this molecule, and the Clemmensen reduction proceeds in the presence of a zinc amalgam and this molecule. For 10 points, name this strong acid that combines with nitric acid to form aqua regia.

answer: {Orsanmichele}

The best known work associated with this building is based on The Golden Legend and depicts a group of men who were beaten to death on Diocletian's orders. On the ground floor, one can see Andrea Orcagna's marble tabernacle, which enshrines Bernardo Daddi's Madonna. Originally built on the site of an orchard, it housed a grain storage center, but became a hub of artistic activity after the seven major guilds were charged with decorating it in 1339. This resulted in the silk merchants bringing in Baccio to create St. John the Evangelist, while the Bankers sponsored Lorenzo Ghiberti's Saint Mathew. Located between the Palazzo della Signoria and Il Duomo, for 10 points, identify this building in Florence, best known for its fourteen niches, which hold such individual masterpieces as The Four Saints by Nanni di Banco and Donatello's St. Mark.

answer: Guru {Arjun Dev}

He argued for a reduction of taxes on farmers and established the system of Langars, or communal kitchens. In addition to constructing a colony for lepers at Tarn Taran, he taught that all, including women, were welcome in the Gurdwara. Also called the “Sacha Patshah,” or “True Emperor,” his support of Prince Khusrau led to his capture by Murtaza Khan. He was subsequently burned and executed under the direction of Jahangir. His greatest accomplishment was precipitated by the false teachings of men like Prithi Chand and dictated to Bhai Gurdas. That accomplishment was first displayed within the Harmandir Sahib in 1604. For 10 points, identify this Sikh holy man who was preceded by his father Ram Das as Guru, and who compiled the Adi Granth.

answer: The {Third Earl} of {Shaftesbury} or {Lord Shaftesbury} [accept {Anthony Ashley Cooper} before it is mentioned]

His Sensus Communis argued for the freedom provided by wit and humor and noted that virtue is often determined by affection. In a treatise subtitled “A Philosophical Rhapsody,” he argued for a morally perfect God. That work also discussed a three part hierarchy of beauty and was called The Moralists. Many of the ideas he espoused in works like Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit formed the basis for the later work of Frances Hutcheson. He argued against egoism and was the first to call man's innate ethical instincts, “the moral sense,” but was singled ohut for his seemingly deistic religious beliefs in George Berkeley's Alciphron. Best known for his 1711 collection, Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, and Times, for 10 points, identify this student of John Locke, who was born Anthony Ashley Cooper.

A splinter faction of this group was captured by a ship known as The Brindled Cow, commanded by Simon of Utrecht. That faction was led by a man named for the fact that he could drink four liters of beer without ever taking his mouth from a beaker. They had their base at the city of Visby, but, after it was captured, many of their members became known as Likedeelers and allied themselves with East Frisian tribesmen. Financed by the Hanseatic League prior to the creation of the Kalmar Union, this organization formed largely as a result of war between Albert of Mecklenburg and Queen Margaret I in 1392. For 10 points, name this maritime guild of pirates in the Baltic, whose name derives from the fact that they supplied food and other provisions to cities.

answer: Charles {Lamb}

His poetry includes a tongue in cheek work based on a meter learned from George Wither, “The Farewell to Tobacco,” as well as the ballad “Hester.” His criticism, which was singled out by A.C. Bradley, includes “On the Artificial Comedy of the Last Century” and “On the Genius of and Character of Hogarth.” He collaborated with Charles Lloyd on Blank Verse, and he was referred to as “gentle hearted” in “This Lime Tree Bower My Prison,” a work by his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Though he struggled with play writing, as evidenced by the failures of both the satire, Mr H, and the Elizabethanesque drama, John Woodvil, he found great success with a series of prose pieces such as “The Praise of Chimney Sweepers,” “Christ's Hospital,” and “A Dissertation on Roast Pig,” all of which were written after adopting the persona of a former Italian clerk at the South Sea house. For 10 points, identify this British writer of the Essays of Elia.

answer: {climate} [I {wouldn't} accept many equivalents – they're all {explicitly} “{climate classifications}”]

One system designed to model this was developed at Seabrook Farms in the 1930s by C. Warren Thornthwaite. That system of modeling this often uses a formula named for Howard Penman and a measure known as the thermal efficiency index. A genetic approach to modeling it was created by Tor Bergeron and modified by Helmut Landsberg, while empirical schemes include the Holdridge system, which generates a triangular or pyramidal diagram, and the Budyko model. The most commonly used method of classifying it was modified by Glenn Trewartha, and that system is named for Vladimir Koppen, who created five categories labeled A through E to describethis by deriving equations to map the boundaries of ecotones. Koppen later added the letter H to describe highland regions. For 10 points, name this measure which varies in different biomes, used to describe the general weather you might encounter in a region.

answer: {Max Schmitt} in a {Single Scull} or The {Champion Single Sculls}

The mansion Sweetbriar can be seen on the brow of the hill on the right in this painting, whose creation was motivated by what the artist referred to as “the prettiest problem in perspective” and was the product of numerous studies. It depicts the mellow sun of an autumn afternoon bathing the Girard Avenue railroad bridge in the background in light, and its artist included himself in the painting, pulling away from the center. A group of trees, as well as a band of people in a truss, create reflections off to the left side of the canvas. Three years after its artist completed this work he produced a similar work depicting a man in a red bandanna named John Biglin, who, rather than simply sitting on the surface of the Schuylkill, was actually in the process of moving the oars. For 10 points, identify this 1871 painting of the titular rower, a work by Thomas Eakins.

In an essay from Why America's Top Pundits are Wrong, Keith Brown asserted that Samuel Huntington's use of kinship resembles the practices of this culture. Boys in this culture are initiated into adulthood by having six sharp lines carved into their foreheads, a ceremony called receiving gaar. Sharon Hutchinson discussed how this group incorporated money using cattle as the dominant metaphor of value in a book titled for the "dilemmas" of this culture. This culture is divided into separate communities called cieng. The first anthropologist to study this culture described their system of segmented lineage in three books, including Kinship and Marriage Among this culture.

answer: {non}-{Newtonian} fluid

The Palierne equation models a suspension of two types of these. The Herschel-Bulkley model describes these when there is a non-linear stress/strain relation, and, when initial flow of these requires a finite yield stress, they are called Bingham plastics. The combined study of these and of plastics is known as rheology. When the properties of these are time-dependent, they are classified as rheopectic or thixotropic, and when they are dependent on the shear stress they are called pseudoplastics or dilatants. When considering these, the numerator in the Prandtl number and the denominator in the Grashof number are no longer constants. For 10 points, identify these types of fluids, the most famous example being a suspension of starch in water that can be walked across, that are defined by their lack of a consistent viscosity.

One member of this family took the title of “shinn?,” or “new emperor,” and attempted to establish a secessionist government at Kant?. Another member of this family destroyed the pirates on the Inland Sea; that one's father allied with Shirakawa to implement the insei system. This group controlled Japan during the so-called Rokuhara regime, having achieved complete power by allying with Go-Shirakawa against Sutoku, and then consolidated their victory in the Heiji War. Despite leading the winning forces in the Hogen Disturbance, this family's downfall was sealed by such military defeats as Ichinotani and Yashima Island, as well as a battle in which a notable sword was lost and Prince Antoku drowned. For 10 points, name this clan which met its end in the 1185 naval battle of Dan-no-ura, leaving Japan to the Minamoto family and Kamakura shogunate.

answer: {interferons} [or {IFNs}]

The story behind the discovery of these proteins was related in the article “How to Chase a Red Herring and Come up with a Smallmouth Bass.” Mice lacking the STAT-1 protein produce roughly half as many of this type of protein as wild type mice. PLSCR-1 amplifies expression of genes whose transcription is induced by them. RIG-1 activates TBK1 and IKK?, which induce transcription of one type of them. Another transcription pathway for them is induced by Toll-like receptor 3. Plasmocytoid dendritic cells are specialized producers of these proteins, discovered by Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann. The most recently discovered class of them is type III, or Type I?. Type I? is typically produced by leukocytes, while Type I? is often produced by fibroblasts and epithelial cells and Type I?, or Type II, is produced by activated T cells. They promote expression of MHC Class I molecules and activate natural killer cells. For 10 points, name these cytokines produced in response to viral infection, which inhibit viral protein synthesis.

answer: {Lorenzo Valla}

He argued against the need to fulfill vows and for the spontaneity of Christianity in On the Religious Profession. He demonstrated that divine prescience and a belief in human autonomy could not be reconciled in On the Free Will. In another work, he presented three distinct points of view on the compatibility of religion and the righteousness of man pursuing his natural appetites. That tract, On Pleasure, preceded a work that considered the question, “if Solomon could fall into idolatry,” could not the same thing happen in the case of a “supreme pontiff.” That question culminated in an argument that Rome's claim that it is “entitled by prescription to what it posseses” is based on the misattribution of a document allegedly given to Sylvester I in the 4th Century.For 10 points, identify this religious thinker who proved in 1440 that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery.

The Gelfand-Neimark theorem deals with proving two of these kinds of spaces to be homeomorphic to one another. Only Tychonoff spaces can be embedded in these types of spaces, and every topological space can be expressed as the quotient of spaces of this type. Etale spaces are the classical example of spaces failing to meet this condition, and if a space is both compact and meets this condition, it is normal and all continuous maps from compact spaces to these spaces are homeomorphisms.
