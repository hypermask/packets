answer: {hydrogen peroxide} [accept {H2O2} before mentioned]

One process for creating this compound involves using gold-palladium nanoparticles on a high surface-area carbon. Another method for synthesizing this compound involves the deprotonation of hydroxy groups on anthracene to ketones and is named for Riedl and Pfleiderer. Generation of this compound in the thyroid requires the presence of calcium ions if NADPH is used, but not if NADH is used. Along with a divalent iron salt, this compound is used in the Ruff degradation, and the Baeyer-Villeger reaction occurs in a solution of this compound and a Lewis acid. Alcohols can be synthesized from alkenes by using this compound in the second step of hydroboration.

answer: {John Carpenter}

Recently, this filmmaker has leant his name to a franchise that saw a 2005 installment about Jon Bon Jovi's pursuit of the Berziers Cross, which was earlier defended from Valek by Jack Crow, played by James Woods. The failure of his Vampires was punctuated only by a special effects award for a massive sand-dyeing effort. He claimed he attempted to adapt Waiting for Godot “in space” for his Dark Star, and he created the memorable Napoleon Wilson, who withstands a siege with the aid of a character played by Austin Stoker. Another of his films features the central antagonist declaring that “you are really pissing me off to no end” before the hero catches a knife and throws it back at him, leading to Kim Cattrall's rescue by Jack Burton from the clutches of James Hong's Lo Pan. That film, Big Trouble in Little China, featured the star of an earlier outing for this director that saw Isaac Hayes shot by the President after his rescue by Snake Plissken, played by Kurt Russell. For 10 points, identify this director who filmed Jamie Lee Curtis's pursuit by murderer Michael Meyers in Halloween and helmed Assault on Precinct 13 and Escape from New York.

answer: {Buck} v. {Bell} [or {Bell} v. {Buck}]

During the state-level hearings that led to this case, one witness testified that a certain Vivian had "a look about her." The respondent in this case was changed following the death of Dr. Priddy, and the appeal rested on the Fourteenth Amendment implications of a passage about "whatever God has given to everyone" in the Munn v. Illinois decision. This case was the first blow against the doctrine of substantive due process, and Justice Pierce Butler was the sole dissenter in this case but declined to write an opinion. This case focused on a woman who was raped by a relative and whose mother was alleged to have had a history of prostitution and immorality. It directly addressed a law promoted by Harry Laughlin, a 1924 Virginia statute mandating sterilization of the mentally retarded, and was partially overturned in the 1942 case of Skinner v. Oklahoma. For 10 points, name this 1927 case in which Oliver Wendell Holmes, in a rare majority opinion, declared that “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”

According to the myths of Central Africa, the Chiruwi, a half-man/half-spirit who must be captured before he divulges his medical knowledge, possesses this trait. In Japanese myth, it is the primary trait associated with the Nurikabe. A golden arrow given by Apollo to his priest, Abaris, temporarily enabled this ability. After the Milesians drove the Tuatha de Danann away from Ireland, the latter were said to have taken the form of the Aes Sidhe who often use this ability. According to Welsh legend, Merlin is said to live on Bardey Island in a glass house which could do this, while the Mabinogion tells the story of Luned's ring which endowed its wearer with this power. Also associated with the Ring of Gyges, before he sets out to kill Medusa, Perseus acquires this power by putting on a helmet given to him by Hades. For 10 points, identify this power that allows someone or something to not be seen.

answer: {Graphene}

Young and Kim have reported observations of Klein tunneling in heterojunctions of this, made possible by a unique band structure that simulates a relativistic wave equation with a greatly increased fine structure constant. Based on the presence of Dirac fermions, the anomalous quantum hall effect was predicted to occur in this before being observed by groups at Columbia and Manchester. Landau and Peierls argued that it could not exist, as divergent thermal fluctuations would cause it to melt at any temperature. Many groups struggled to produce it by epitaxial growth or intercalation of its quotidian parent compound, but the breakthrough in fabrication depended on 3M Scotch Tape. For 10 points, identify this material first isolated by Geim and Novoselov in 2004 and often touted as the next silicon, a two-dimensional single layer of hexagonally-arrayed carbon atoms.

answer: {Lyric Suite} [or {Lyrische Suite}]

This work originally contained a soprano line setting Stefan George's translation of Baudelaire's poem De Profundis Clamavi in its final movement marked Largo Desolato. It ends with a melancholy movement where Tristan and Isolde is briefly quoted in the cello. The lengths of various sections and metronome markings are largely dictated by manipulations of the numbers 23 and 10, and the sequence A, B-flat, B, F is derived from the names of the subjects. It takes its title from a work composed by Alexander von Zemlinsky, and along with the Kammerkonzert, it marks the composer's transition to use of the twelve-tone system.

answer: Willy Brandt [or Herbert {Ernst Karl Frahm}]

This man's tenure as head of state saw a substantial cultural clash over films like Love in the Leather Pants and Holidays at Mt. Boinker, which were a variety of pornography named after a certain region. Herbert Hupka left this man's party during his tenure and attacked an incident in which this leader visited a war memorial and dropped to one knee. Late in life, he proposed a line dividing the economies of the world between North and South in a namesake report. Systematic bribing likely prevented his ousting in a no-confidence vote by Rainier Barzel. That corruption may have been organized by Markus Wolf, who also oversaw an intelligence operative who served as one of this man's personal secretaries, Gunter Guillame, resulting in a scandal when the latter's Stasi ties were exposed.

One section of this work analyzes a defense provided before the High Court of Vendome by Gracchus Babeuf, while another examines pornography and the rise of “Aesopian Language.” It opens by comparing certain forces to the shadow of nuclear war, and includes a section quoting Barthes' Writing Degree Zero and referring to Brecht's “distancing effect,” while examining the phrase “HAPPY CONSCIOUSNESS” rendered in all caps. It advocates a process in which “the Pleasure Principle absorbs the Reality Principle,” called “repressive desublimation,” in the section “The Chance of the Alternatives.” This work claims that a “dazzling array of lifestyles” masquerades as free choice, causing false needs, and in turn the titular construct. This work issues a rallying cry for a “Great Refusal” to the technological and cultural developments this work argues have enslaved modern society. For 10 points, identify this work, published a decade after Eros and Civilization, which posits that consumerism has led to the creation of a limited figure, written by Herbert Marcuse.

Its creation was inspired by its namesake's trip to Japan with John La Farge, although most art historians believe that its creator was influenced by the works of Claus Sluter and the contemporary exhibition of an Antonin Mercie sculpture. Its central figure's hand is brought up to the face, though the hand barely touches the cheek. The rest of the seated body is obscured by a coarse cloth that forms a shroud over the figure's head. Built to honor a woman who went by the nickname “Clover” and who was born with the last name Hooper, this work is faced by a bench which is cast in bronze and is seated on a stone in Washington D.C.'s Rock Creek Cemetery. Finished in 1891, for 10 points, identify this monument created by Augustus St. Gaudens which bears the last name of the man who commissioned it, the author of Mont St. Michel and Chartres.

answer: {G} proteins [accept early {GTPase switch proteins}]

This class of molecules shares its name with a protein that associates with BiP and calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum after being produced in the secretory pathway of the vesicular stomatitis virus. One protein in this class induces membrane ruffles upon injection into fibroblasts, and another mimics the effects of the chemokine LPA. In another one, replacement of the glycine at position 12 keeps it in the active state, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Effectors associated with this class include adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, and the trimeric form breaks into a beta-gamma dimer and an alpha subunit, which activates a second messenger to begin a signal transduction cascade. For 10 points, name this class of proteins, monomeric forms of which include Rac and Ras, which, when active, hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate.

The p-adics are useful examples of these in number theory, and a theorem of Weierstrass and Hilbert shows that any attempt to generalize this concept to triplets of numbers is equivalent to the complex numbers. These are called Pythagorean if they contain the square root of one plus the square of any element, and perfect if all finite extensions are separable. The main theorem of Galois theory relates certain subsets of Galois extensions of these to the subgroups of the Galois group. The characteristic of one of these is the number of times you must add one to itself to get zero and must always be a prime, and a finite one of these must have order equal to a power of some prime. For 10 points, name this algebraic structure, examples of which include the reals and rationals but not the integers, defined as a set with two binary operators in which addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division are all well-defined and the distributive law is satisfied.
