answer: The {School} for {Husbands} [or {L'Ecole des maris}]

At this play's start, one man complains to his younger brother that he should dress more for fashion than for comfort, claiming that his clothes reinforce his ugly behavior, about which Lisette asks him “Are we Turks?” In its second act, aided by the valet Ergaste, the main lovers communicate by sending unopened letters to each other, and later, the female lover puts on a veil, pretending to be her sister so as to fool its protagonist when the notary arrives to perform a marriage. Ariste's (*) leniency toward his ward and eventual wife Leonor provides the positive example for this work's title institution, while Isabelle's ability to marry Valere by manipulating Ariste's overly-controlling brother Sganarelle provides a negative one. Followed by a similarly-titled comedy about Agnes's evasion of her guardian Arnolphe, name, for 10 points, this Moliere comedy intended to educate male spouses.

That narrator had earlier been unable to save either the peasant girl who took his virginity or the (*) hunchback Salvatore from being executed by Bernard Gui, whose solution to the deaths of Venantius, Adelmo, Berengar and others differs from that of his former Inquisiton colleague.

answer: {Aphra Behn}

This region's holes remind the protagonist of a baptismal font which he had destroyed to save a boy from drowning, and the first groups of people he meets here march in opposite directions like Romans over the Tiber at Jubilee. This place is home to Malacoda, who farts in lieu of blowing a trumpet and falsely reports the presence of bridges, as well as the dragon Cacus. Leading down to it is the waterfall of the bloody river Phlegethon, over which the beast (*) Geryon flies the protagonist, it is divided into ten ditches that culminate in a Tartaros-like pit, home to earth giants Antaeus, Briareus, and Nimrod. The protagonist also meets here five thieves who transform each other into beasts, as well as the Jovial Friars, Ulysses, Jason, and Mohammed. For 10 points, simoniacs, sowers of discord and other commissioners of simple fraud inhabit what penultimate realm of Dante's Inferno?

answer: “The {English Mail Coach}”

The narrator of this work speculates about being “number 10 or 12” among a woman's list of lovers, but then realizes that he is “number 199 plus 1.” Prior to that, this work observes that there are two possible causes of a “monstrous inaptitude for turning round,” either the length or breadth of the back, which make Fanny's father comparable to a crocodile. Between the epigraph from Paradise Lost and the text of one section, the word “tumultuosissimamente” appears, and that section goes on to reveal that the “secret word” is “Waterloo and recovered Christendom.” Opening with the claim that a Mr. Palmer, MP for Bath, had invented the title object, this essay contains a passage on “The Vision of Sudden Death” that recounts a driver falling asleep, in between “Going Down with Victory” and the concluding “Dream Fugue.” Recounting several near-crashes and the experience of riding the title (*) conveyance while high on opium, this work was originally intended as part of Suspiria de Profundis.

answer: Johann Christoph Friedrich von {Schiller}

The secretary Wurm conspires to unravel Prince Ferdinand's affair with the commoner Luise in a play by this man named, appropriately enough, Cabal and Love. One of his history plays sees Sir Mortimer commit suicide when his plan to free the title character fails and the Earl of Leicester switch his affections to that character's reigning cousin; in another, Max and Thekla's love is insufficient for keeping Illo, Terzky, and the title character from being killed by (*) Piccolomini's scheme. He contrasted the sensuous and formal drives in his treatise On the Aesthetic Education of Man, though he was forbidden from writing anything but medical tracts after deserting his regiment to see his first play, in which a university student joins with Spiegelberg in the Bohemian Forest in opposition to his brother and father, Franz and Max von Moor.

answer: Le {Citta Invisibili} [or {Invisible Cities}]

One character in this novel responds to another's belief that the ear “commands the story” by attempting to use a chessboard to understand the traveler's descriptions. That traveler then notes the infinite possibilities of the composition of such a board. That character had earlier used pantomimes for his tales before learning the language. In this work, Zemrude may be interpreted based on the mood of the observer, while Despina yields a different vision if it is approached by sea rather than by desert. This novel has no plot but divides the titular (*) locations into eleven categories, where Melania is “of the dead” and Theodora, with its vermin problems, is “hidden” and each of them has the name of a woman. The primary setting of this novel is the court of a Khubilai Khan and it follows that ruler's discussions with Marco Polo. For 10 points, name this Magical Realist novel by Italo Calvino.
