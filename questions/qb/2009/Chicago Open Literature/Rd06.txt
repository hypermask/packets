answer: {Katherine Ann Porter}

One of this author's works centers on a mentally challenged boy who is exploited by the Whipple family, while another, later, story describes how Kuno's friendship bring a young Texan named Charles Upton to Berlin.  Satirized as the “enameled lady” in Truman Capote's unfinished final work, Answered Prayers, her non-fiction included such essays as “Portrait: Old South” and an essay on the achievements of Henry James that would title the collection The Days Before.  In addition to penning the heretofore described “He” and (*) “The Leaning Tower,” this author created the character of Miranda, a woman who struggles to survive during a flu pandemic, and Homer T. Hatch, an investigator who tries to solve a murder, but ends up dead a the hands of Mr. Thompson in the story “Noon Wine.”  Her only novel is set aboard the Vera, a freighter that makes its way from Veracruz to Germany, in 1931.

answer: "The {Beast} in the {Jungle}"

Eve Sedgwick's essay on this story replaces the last word of its title with "closet." One character in this work is compared to "a serene and exquisite but impenetrable sphinx" but later is an "artificial lily, wonderfully imitated and constantly kept... under some clear glass bell." In its final scene, the protagonist sees the "deep ravage of the features" of a mourning man, allowing him to realize the true nature of the title entity, which "had (*) sprung in that twilight of the cold April." The protagonist flings himself on the tomb of the woman who loved him at the end of this work, whom he had told in Pompeii of “something rare and strange, possibly prodigious and terrible" which is his fate. For 10 points, name this short story in which the death of May Bartram precipitates the revelation of the title monster for John Marcher, a work of Henry James.

One of his poems speaks about how “the cold wind, moaning, blows against you fiercely”, while another talks about “the moon reflected on the river a few feet away”. In addition to “Overflowing”, he wrote about a bird who had lost his flock in the snow in “The Solitary Goose”. He addresses another writer with the line “what are you thinking of, old friend” before his subject drowns in a river, and this author of “Sighs of Autumn (*) Rain” wrote about a tree with green bronze brances in “Ballad of the Ancient Cypress”. Another of his works begins by talking about how the title objects “rumble and roll” while horses “winnie and neigh”, and speaks of how soldiers were “driven like dogs and chickens”.

answer: The {Preface} to the {Lyrical Ballads} [accept obvious equivalents; it {doesn't matter} if they {use} a {synonym} for “{preface}”, but {don't} accept or prompt on {Lyrical Ballads} by {itself}]

This essay contrasts the Man of Science, “who seeks truth as a remote and unknown benefactor,” with the Poet, who sees it “as our visible friend and hourly companion,” though the latter is ready to transfigure science and make it “familiarized to men.”  It also dismisses a Samuel Johnson poem by claiming “Why take pains to prove that an ape is not a Newton, when it is self-evident he is not a man,” and claims there are only five good lines in a Thomas Gray sonnet when it makes its argument for the merit of prosaic rhythm.  It pronounces poetry to be (*) “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings,” which begin in “emotion recollected in tranquility,” and suggests that poets should look more to “common life” and “the language really used by men.”  For 10 points, name this manifesto of British Romanticism that introduces a poetry collection including “Goody Blake and Harry Gill,” “The Idiot Boy,” and “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” written by William Wordsworth

answer: “The {Blessed Damozel}”

This work describes the moon “curled”  “like a little feather” and a bar made warm by a bosom.  It tells of “five handmaidens” named Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen, Margaret, and Rosalys, who weave a golden thread for the newly “born” and alludes to Revelation in its description of a “living mystic tree” which contains a dove under whose shadow the title figure and the addressee will lie.  The phrase “we two” is repeated five times, but by the end of this work, the speaker's hope for a reunion is tempered as the title figure “laid her face between her hands.”  This work, which was originally published in The Germ, takes its theme from La Vita Nuova, and ends with the line “And wept (I heard her tears).”  For ten points, identify this work about a woman who gazes down from heaven upon her earthly love, a poem by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

answer: The {Diary} of a {Young} Girl [or The {Diary} of {Anne Frank} or {Het Achterhuis}]

Early in this work, we learn that Bep has ordered a correspondence course for one character just before the punchline “a centipede with a clubfoot” is recounted, and a similarly comic story includes a sign reading “RSVP-gas!” on a bathroom door. Miep and Ellie are some women that help that family while Jopie Kleiman plays with the title character and Pim's son Peter is her possible crush. Mouchi's urine drips through the floor into a sack of potatoes below after using a pile of shavings rather than a litter box. This story follows the Van (*) Daan family, based on the Van Pels, sharing space with Dr. Düsser and the family of the title character, including Edith and Margot, at 263 Prinsengracht. Written as letters to the imaginary friend Kitty, this work opens with the title character receiving a clothbound notebook for her thirteenth birthday in 1942.

answer: {Joris Karl Huysmans}

This author's Becalmed centers on a couple's move from the hustle and bustle of the city to the country, while the struggles of the titular working class girls dominates this author's The Vatard Sisters.  This author described the odors emanating from a woman's under arms in the short story, The Gusset, which was included in his Parisian Sketches.  Some of this author's earlier work, beginning with the story of Jean Folantin's attempts at finding satisfaction, With the Flow, foreshadow his later spiritual works such as the study The Crowds of Lourdes (*) and the novel, The Cathedral.  Up to that point his best selling work had been a novel about a character named Durtal who investigates the evil Canon Docre's satanic ways.  That work, commonly translated as Down There, is less well known than an 1884 work that features rapturous descriptions of Moreau paintings, a tortoise with a golden shell, and sex with an acrobat.  For ten points identify, this creator of the ultimate aesthete, the Duc des Esseintes, in his masterpiece Against Nature.

His disavowal of (*) Negritude, whose proponents he identifies as Neo-Tarzanists, can be seen in his tale of Eman who chooses to become a “carrier” and sacrifice himself to save the young Ifada.  In addition to The Strong Breed, this author published a novel about intellectuals in Lagos, The Interpreters, and plays centering on Brother Jero.  One of his best known works climaxes with the deaths of Olunde and his father, Elesin, while another details the struggle for the love of Sidi, between Baroka and Lakunle.
