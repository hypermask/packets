answer: {Jimmy Corrigan}, the {Smartest Kid} on {Earth}

During a dialogue-free scene in this book, a man holds up a tape recorder to a singing red bird, plays back the birdsong, then repeats the process with an airplane passing overhead. Near the start of this work, that same man receives a note proclaiming “I sat across from you for SIX MONTHS and you never ONCE noticed me!,” answers his one hundredth phone call from his mother of the day, and notices a figure dressed as a superhero commit suicide by jumping off a building. A diagram pointing to two entries in a yearbook titled "high school 1964" and an image of the Oswaga County Adoption Services building explains why the protagonist's adopted sister is black, and that protagonist later commits a faux pas by hitting on said sister during a Thanksgiving visit. The main narrative, about a reunion in small-town Michigan with the title character's long-lost (*) father, is interwoven with flashbacks to the protagonist's grandfather being abandoned at the Chicago World's Fair.

answer: The {Dream} of the {Rood}

This poem's puzzling word holmwudu has been explained by analogy to the Pange Lingua of Venantius Fortunatus, or as an oblique reference to the placement of paradise in Genesis.

The line "our enemies began to fell us" is one of several images evoking the fate of a contemporary war-band, like the "gaping gashes of malice" endured by the title object, a wondrous "tree of victory" which held "felons on high" before "all creation wept" as it "bore aloft the mighty King." For 10 points, name this Anglo-Saxon poem, which describes "the best of dreams" as a vision of the Cross.
