One character in this play attempts to explain time as something which flies while he is talking, which causes one of his pupils to run away from class.

answer: Philip {Sidney}

In one of this man's songs, he exhorts "Let here his eyes be raised/On Nature's sweetest light" and another song ends each quatrain with the couplet "Take me to thee, and thee to me/ No, no, no, no, my dear, let be." Besides "Who hath this fancy pleased" and "Only joy, now here you are", another song claims "All love is dead, infected/ With plague of deep disdain" and demands "Ring out your bells."

answer: Jean-Paul {Sartre}

With Jorge Semprun, he argued against the “new novel” in the “What Can Literature Do?” debate.  Earlier, he claimed that the absurdity and lack of syntactic causality employed by Meursault yields a Voltairean effect in his “Commentary on The Stranger,” and he refused to address poetic Beauty, favoring anti-Freduain psychoanalysis, in his book-length essay on Baudelaire. This founder of the journal Modern Times also lionized the author of Our Lady of the Flowers in (*) Saint Genet and claimed that “reading is directed creation,” because the public can change anything it reads due to a writer's being “outside language,” in his “What is Literature?”, which applied to art a philosophyy that he had previously declared “is a humanism” based on the idea that “existence precedes essence.” For 10 points, name this French critic who also composed Dirty Hands, “The Wall,” Nausea, and Being and Nothingness.

answer: “{Crossing Brooklyn Ferry}”

This work becomes more personal in the seventh stanza when the speaker states “closer yet I approach you” and “Who knows but I am enjoying this?” That same narrator speaks of birds “oscillating their bodies” in the third and eighth stanzas and cites images of “the wolf, the snake, the dog” to illustrate evil in the sixth one. The repetition of the word “others” in the middle of the second stanza accentuates the people besides the speaker who enjoy the same experiences as he, especially the sunset and the (*) ebb-tide. A member of the “Calamus” poems, this work was first titled “Sun-Down Poem” and exclamatorily begins “Flood-tide below me / I see you face to face!” The speaker simultaneously stands still but is set in motion by the titular transport, drawing out “the similitudes of the past and those of the future”.
