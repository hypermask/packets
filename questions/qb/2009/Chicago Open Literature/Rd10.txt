answer: {Volpone}

During a soliloquy, one character in this play claims that "I fear I shall begin to grow in love/With my dear self" and that he "could skip/ Out of my skin now, like a subtle snake."

That claim gets him tricked when some merchants jump up and down on him while he hides in a (*) tortoise shell, and besides characters like Peregrine and the Would-Be couple, the title character disguises himself as Scoto the Mountebank and meets the servants Nano, Androgyno and Castrone playing outside, tipping him to the fact his former "parasite" may be tricking him after he is announced as heir to a fortune variously desired by Corbaccio, Corvino, and Voltore.
