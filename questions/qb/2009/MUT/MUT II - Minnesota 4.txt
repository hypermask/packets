These entities can be hierarchically classified based on the Strahler Order. The speed of objects in this kind of system varies by the sixth power of this system's speed by Brahm's law.

When these bodies form underneath glaciers, they create braided ridges known as eskers. Their cross-sectional area multiplied by their average linear velocity gives their discharge. These bodies create ox-bow lakes when they cut off a meander. For 10 points, name these bodies of water exemplified by the Amazon and Mississippi.
