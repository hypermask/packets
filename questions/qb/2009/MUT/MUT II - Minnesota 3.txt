Adding forward declarations makes "single-pass" ones less error-prone. Those that aren't used until runtime are known as "Just-In-Time" ones, and ones written in the language they're used for are called bootstrappers.

answer: glycine

The condensation of this compound and succinyl-coA results in the synthesis of ALA, which is the first step of heme synthesis. Every third residue in collagen features this amino acid, and the interconversion between this compound and serine is performed by serine hydroxymethylase. The presence of this amino acid is obligatory for the opening of channels of the NMDA receptors, and it functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Like proline, it is usually not found in alpha helices because of its small size, and it is the only amino acid which does not exhibit chirality. For 10 points, identify this simplest of the amino acids.

Pair potentials in these systems can be calculated by an equation which uses the Hamaker constant. The earliest model for a charged metal plate in these systems was developed by Helmholtz, and has been replaced by a modification of the Gouy-Chapman theory named for Stern. Richard Zsigmondy invented a microscope to observe these systems, which can be modeled by DLVO theory. Induction of clumping in these systems is termed flocculation, whereas the dispersion of light in these systems is known as the Tyndall effect. For 10 points, identify these systems wherein small particles are suspended in a medium, exemplified by aerosols and emulsions.
