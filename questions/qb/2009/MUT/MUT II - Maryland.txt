answer: {quantum} [or {simple}] {harmonic oscillators} [prompt on partial answers]

Bertrand's theorem states that stable orbits can only occur for coulomb potentials and these types of potentials. Potentials of this type possess energy eigenstates of h-bar times omega times the quantity n plus one-half and can be solved algebraically by using raising and lowering operators. These objects can be described with a second-order differential equation which equates Newton's Second Law and a displacement times Hooke's constant. For 10 points, identify these objects that experience a restoring force when displaced from their equilibrium point, examples of which include masses on springs and pendulums.

One critique of this discipline notes that its early practitioners denied “coevalness” to the object it studies.  Matti Bunzel and Johannes Fabian's Time and the Other is subtitled after “How [this discipline] makes its object.”  Jacques Derrida critiqued this discipline by claiming that it implies a center, and does not allow “play” in the essay “Structure, Sign, and Play.” One text in this discipline makes use of the term “bricolage” to describe the process of creating mythologies, and that author founded the “structural” version of this discipline in such works as The Raw and the Cooked.

answer: {transposons} [or jumping genes before mentioned]

One type of these entities is characterized by identical sequences of about 400 repeated base pairs flanked by inverted repeats of about 15 base pairs. Another type of these structures is responsible for causing the condition of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila. In addition to MITEs and P elements, another type of these structures found abundantly in humans is called Alu elements which are a form of SINEs. The first one to be discovered is the Ac-Ds system which was found during studies of the maize plant. First discovered in 1983 by Barbara McClintock, for 10 points, identify these mobile sequences of DNA that are often nicknamed “jumping genes.”

answer: {Markov chain} [prompt on {Markov Property}; or {state}-{dependent function}]

In 1970, Paul Cohen proved by induction that these constructs alone are insufficient to create an artificial intelligence that would pass the Turing test. When one of these constructs satisfies an additional property, it is named after Harris. A version of this construct in which results are completely independent is called the Bernoulli scheme. Examples include random-walk phenomena in physics and the rolling of dice to move pieces across a game-board. For 10 points, name this kind of stochastic process in which any future set of conditions is determined by and only by the present set of conditions, named for a Soviet mathematician.

The first section after this work's prologue depicts a plane's shadow over a cheering crowd. The myth that this film was edited down from 250 miles of footage was debunked in the Ray Mueller film about its director's “Wonderful, Horrible Life.” “We Are the Dawn” plays as this film opens with a rather homoerotic montage of strapping young men washing one another's backs; its closing scene is compiled from footage from an NSDAP rally, much like the director's earlier piece, Der Sieg des Glaubens, which had become unsuitable with the fall from favor of Ernst Röhm.

The Nozicki-Hiyama-Kishi reaction uses organometallic compounds featuring chromium or this element. It can be extracted from its oxide ore through heating in the presence of a mixture of hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide to yield a tetracarbonyl intermediate, which decomposes to yield four carbon monoxides in a process named for Mond.
