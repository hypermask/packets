answer: {Heimdallr}

Alternate names for this god, who once fought a rival in the form of a seal, include Hallinskidi, meaning "bent stick" or "ram," and Vindhler, or "wind shelter". One kenning for the word “sword” is the “head of [this god]”, which is odd, because his own sword was named “head”, or Hofund. He created the serfs, peasants, and warriors after spending a night in the bed of Afi and Amma in the form of the god Rig and fathering Thrall, Karl, and Jarl. With his horse Gulltoppr, he lives in the hall Himinbjorg.  He was the son of the nine billow maidens, and he and Loki will slay each other at Ragnarok, which he will announce by blowing the Gjallarhorn. For 10 points, name this Norse god with incredibly keen senses, the keeper of the rainbow bridge Bifrost.

answer: {Peyton Manning}

In this quarterback's first college bowl game, he and backup Brandon Stewart helped put up 45 points against Virginia Tech in the Gator Bowl, a school record. His first playoff appearance as a pro saw him throw no touchdowns in a 19-16 loss to the Titans in a game played a week after the Music City Miracle. This man was drafted the same year, 1998, as the man who edged him in the Heisman vote, Charles Woodson. In 2001, after an ugly loss to the 49ers, this man's coach, Jim Mora Sr., made an infamous rant about his team's playoff chances. A 41-0 playoff rout at the hands of the Jets led to this man inventing the phrase “idiot kicker” to describe Mike Vanderjagt. For 10 points, identify this three-time NFL MVP, the quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts.

This man attempted to formally legalize his leadership by passing the Organic Laws, one of which, the Law of Succession, declared the government a monarchy and gave him the power to name his successor. His deputy prime minister was assassinated in a car bombing two years before this man would himself die. One of his first major acts as head of state was the Decree of Unification, which merged all nationalist parties under his FET party. Prior to seizing power, this man had run afoul of the leftist Popular Front, which sent him to serve as the military commander of the Canary Islands. Undeterred, he helped spark an uprising which eventually led to the horrific bombing of the Basque town of Guernica. For 10 points, identify this man, who was succeeded by King Juan Carlos I, the supreme leader of Spain from 1936 to 1975.

In one scene in this film, a man describes an incident in 1896 when he saw a girl carrying a white parasol and the persistence of this memory. In another sequence, a child says “Merry Christmas” to his guardian, which is immediately followed by a flash-forward decades later of the guardian saying “and a happy new year.” One item in this movie is the titular character's Declaration of Principles, of which a copy is retained by Jedediah Leland. This movie begins with a fake newsreel in which a narrator describes the titular character as “America's Kubla Khan,” a reference to his private estate named Xanadu. The most well known object in this film is the titular character's boyhood toy, a sled.

One of this man's novels centers around the Tolm family, which is overwhelmed by the titular phenomenon, while in the title character of another work is a maid who gets mixed up with a case involving Ludwig Gotten, and shoots Werner Totges after he asks "how about a bang?" In addition to The Safety Net and The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum, he described a character who befriends Rahel, falls in love with Boris, and bears the child Lev, while various members of the Faehmel family reconcile in September 1958 as Robert routinely plays the title game in another novel.

answer: {nitric} acid [accept {HNO3} until mentioned]

Rosenheim and Callow developed a test in which a mixture of this compound and metal acetates are used to detect the presence of sterols. Millon's reagent is a solution of mercury in this substance and a similar substance, which turns red in the presence of phenolic compounds and is useful in detecting tyrosine residues. The commercial production of this compound begins with the combustion of ammonia using a platinum-rhodium catalyst; that process is the Ostwald process. For 10 points, identify this acid which is found with hydrochloric acid in aqua regia, and has chemical formula HNO3.

The majority opinion in this case compares the event at hand to that of the earlier Strauder v. West Virginia and refers to the precedent set by Roberts v. City of Boston. This opinion, written by Henry Billings Brown, rejected the arguments of counsel Albion Tourgée. This case's dissenting opinion contains the line “there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens,” an idealistic statement that contrasts with the majority's opinion that legislation is “powerless to abolish distinctions based upon physical differences.” For 10 points, name this 1896 U.S. Supreme Court case, in which John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter to a ruling that upheld “separate but equal” laws as constitutional.

One type of these exhibit a peculiar behavior which can be described by the Ridley-Watkins-Hilsum two-valley model; that type shows a negative differential resistance profile for fields higher than 3 KV per centimeter. Another type, which make use of quantum tunnelling, are named for Esaki, and they can be employed to rectify AC current into DC current. The ideal behaviour of these is governed by the Shockley equation, and another type employs the avalanche breakdown effect named for Zener. Yet another one of these is formed by the contact of the semiconductor, and they are symbolized by a forward triangle touching a vertical bar.

The "chordin" and "noggin" expressing centers in this structure contain cells which are precursors to Spemann's organizer cells, and the motility of cells during this stage may be classified as cavitation or ingression. Newport and Kirschner described a "transition" that occurs at the middle of this stage where transcription of zygotic genome begins and the cell cycle lengthens. The transition to its subsequent stage involves the formation of the endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm, and it sees a layer of cells forming a hollow sphere which encloses fluid called the blastocoel. For 10 points, identify this stage of development which precedes the gastrula.

The Glatzmaier-Roberts model can be used to explain events that affect it, and VADM and VDM values are often used to study its behavior. Certain data sets from Columbia river basalt flows from the Steens Mountains notably show evidence for its erratic behavior. The South Atlantic Anomaly is the location where it has its lowest intensity and the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary about marks the last inversion of it, which occurred 800,000 years ago.

This man labeled marriage as something that “must sooner or later come to pass,” and had his teacher, the Earl of Bute, provide him with a list of eligible princesses before finally marrying Charlotte Sophia. Unable to form long-term alliances with such ministers as the Earl of Newcastle and George Grenville, he finally found a fruitful relationship with a man whom he would ultimately break with regarding the idea of Catholic emancipation to preserve unity with Ireland. Besides William Pitt the Younger, this man's ministers also included Lord North, who was forced out of office by a vote of no confidence after the battle of Yorktown.
