answer: {telomeres}

The shelterin complex protects these entities from non-homologous end joining, and they can form G-quadraplexes with bonding between G and C sequences. The TRAP assay is used to study the activity of enzymes associated with them. Disruptions in TFR2 binding to these regions results in damage signaling. The RNA-containing enzyme that extends these was discovered by Blackburn and is responsible for the characteristic repeat of these entities. Their shortening causes the end-replication problem, which leads to the Hayflick limit on eukaryotic cell division. For 10 points, name this region found at the end of linear chromosomes.

answer: ethers

Copper catalysis is used to effect the synthesis of aryl ones through the Ullman condensation. The compound BADGE, which has one of these functional groups, is an agonist for the PPAR gamma transcription factors. The Brook rearrangement is used to produce silyl forms of these, while another type which often used for phase transfer catalysis are known as the “crown” variety. Secondary ones have a tendency to spontaneously form peroxides. Cyclic ones are known as oxiranes, and when they come in three-membered rings, they are called epoxides. For 10 points, identify this functional group, which consists of two alkyl groups connected to an oxygen.
