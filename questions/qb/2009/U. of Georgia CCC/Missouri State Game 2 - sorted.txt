answer: speed of {sound}

An object exceeding this quantity will experience amplified pressure perturbations explained by the Prandtl-Glauert singularity that causes a visible vapor cloud to form. For a solid, this value is equal to the square root of Young's modulus divided by the solid's density; for liquids, Young's modulus is replaced by the bulk modulus. An object exceeding 25 times this value causes the surrounding gas to turn to plasma, and in air, it is increased by about .6 meters per second for every temperature increase of one degree Centigrade. An object traveling at this speed is said to be at Mach 1. For 10 points, name this value measuring about 340 meters per second in air.

answer: transcription

In eukaryotes, this process is followed by a sequence of 5' (five prime) capping, 3' (three prime) polyadenylation, and splicing of exons; this produces its monocistronic type of product. The lac operon insures that structural genes do not undergo this process by automatically attaching a repressor protein to the relevant operator. This process begins when a promoter is recognized and usually only takes place on a so-called template strand of DNA. Consisting of initiation, elongation, and termination and following translation, for 10 points, name this process by which complementary base pairing is used to convert DNA into mRNA.

The Cayley-Menger type of this mathematical construct is used to find the volume of a simplex. Charles Dodgson developed a “condensation method” for calculating these values, which are invariant under a singularity transformation and are multiplied by negative one if two rows are interchanged. Cofactors and expansion by minors are used to calculate all but the simplest of these quantities, and a matrix for which this value is zero is called singular. For 10 points, name this value, which for a 2 x 2 matrix a, b; c, d is found by calculating a times d minus b times c.
