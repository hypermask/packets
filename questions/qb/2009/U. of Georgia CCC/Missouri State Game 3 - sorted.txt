answer: x-rays

Henry Moseley's plot modeling the square roots of frequencies of characteristic ones of these was used to calculate elements' atomic numbers. A law modeled by the equation two d sine theta equals n lambda models the diffraction of these entities; this relation is known as Bragg's Law. Max von Laue discovered that crystals could diffract this type of radiation, and the scattering of light by either gamma rays or these entities is known as the Compton Effect. Having frequencies between those of gamma rays and ultraviolet radiation, name this type of electromagnetic radiation discovered by Wilhelm Roentgen and often used for medical imaging purposes.

answer: {lanthanide series} or {lanthanides}

The mineral monazite consists of phosphates of several of these elements. A mixture of these elements called misch metal is used to purify steel, and an alloy of one of these elements with cobalt produces the strongest known permanent magnetic force. A slightly larger group consists of these elements as well as scandium and yttrium, the rare earth metals, and cerium is the most abundant of these elements in nature. Their namesake contraction, or unexpected decrease in ionic radius, is due the poor shielding of 4f electrons.

answer: {acid rain}

One technique used to reduce the severity of this phenomenon is called FGD and uses a limestone slurry to create harmless compounds such as calcium sulfite. Increased aluminum content in soils is a byproduct of this phenomenon. A complementary phenomenon to this one is dry deposition, and it can be produced naturally when lightning splits certain nitrogen-containing compounds. Caused by excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, name this type of pollution in which the pH of precipitation is dangerously low.

answer: Olympia

A model used for this painting was previously pictured in The Street Singer and The Fifer, in which she was conflated with the artist's stepson.

The title figure is only wearing one shoe, and she refuses a bouquet of flowers offered by a pink-clad African servant.
