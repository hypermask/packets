answer: {Henry's} Law

This law's namesake coefficient can change according to the van't Hoff equation with temperature. In one form, it is similar to Raoult's Law, substituting a coefficient based on the ratio of pressure to concentration for the vapor pressure. Like Raoult's Law, it is based on a limit, and only applies for sufficiently dilute solutions. This law also diverges when the gas chemically reacts with the solvent it is dissolved in. Name this law that explains why pop eventually goes flat when exposed to the atmosphere, which states that for a constant temperature, the amount of gas dissolved in a particular liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the liquid.

answer: {viscosity} [accept {modifier} of “{dynamic}” or “{kinematic}” before {both} have {been} mentioned]

The Navier-Stokes equations can be simplified into the Euler (OY-lur) equations by setting heat conduction and this quantity both equal to zero. Fluids for which this quantity is the same at every point are called Newtonian. One type of this quantity is sometimes called the diffusivity of momentum, while the other equals the ratio of shear stress to the rate of strain. It can be measured in pascal-seconds, which are called poise (PWAHS), or in stokes; those types are the kinematic and dynamic, respectively. Absent in superfluids, name this property of fluids akin to friction in solids.

Name this economic concept which diminishes as quantity increases, defined as the amount of benefit gained by an individual when one more unit of a good is produced or purchased.
