answer: {damping} [or {damped} simple harmonic {motion/oscillation}; accept word forms; prompt

If the discriminant of this phenomenon's auxiliary equation is positive, this effect is said to be over-present, while a zero discriminant gives the critical type. Applied to an oscillator, this phenomenon is equivalent to one present in RLC circuits, and exponentially decaying oscillations are present when the namesake coefficient of this phenomenon is less than the product of the maximum amplitude and the spring constant. This phenomenon can be modeled by the equation m s-double prime equals negative b s-prime minus k s, where b is the namesake coefficient. Name this phenomenon characterizing motion that eventually trails off, such as that contrasted with simple harmonic motion.

answer: {activation} energy [accept {E}-{sub}-{A} before it is mentioned]

This value is often determined experimentally by finding the reaction rate at different temperatures, then plotting the logarithm of the rate constant against the reciprocal of temperature and finding the slope of the line of best fit. A relatively low value of this indicates that a greater proportion of colliding reactants will result in reactions. It appears in the numerator of the exponent of the Arrhenius equation, and catalysts work by lowering this value for particular reactions. Name this value denoted as E-sub-A, that measures the minimum energy needed for a reaction to occur.

answer: {closure} [or {closed}, etc.]

With the usual metric, a set is compact if and only if the set is bounded and has this property, according to the Heine-Borel theorem. If a set has this property, then its complement consists entirely of interior points, and sets of this type contain all of their accumulation points. If a set has this property under a particular operation, then the result of that operation on two elements of the set produces an element of the set. Intervals with this property contain their boundary points. Name this property of sets that, for intervals, is denoted with square brackets.
