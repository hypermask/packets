answer: {apoptosis}

This process is caused by “ced” genes, first discovered in C. elegans. Nitrous oxide is thought to induce this event, by activating SMACs and allowing cytochrome c to exit the mitochondria.

Theories for its deliberate initiation by the human body include the TNF-induced model, which may play a role in autoimmune diseases. Triggered by caspase proteins, name this process of programmed cell death.
