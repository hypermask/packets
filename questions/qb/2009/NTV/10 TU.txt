answer: sexual {reproduction} [prompt on {reproduction}; accept {mating} or other equivalents]

In apicomplexans, this process involves the transformation of merozoites into gamonts, while in fungi, it includes a stage in which mycelia fuse: plasmogamy. While most protists do not engage in this process, some Euglena and Amoeba do. Another variation of this process leads to vivipary. In humans, it is most effective just before the beginning of the luteal phase, and it is often employed recreationally by bonobos. Birds' execution of this process is called a cloacal kiss, and most organisms pair off for it. Name this process that results in genetically diverse offspring.

The inspiration for this work was tied by its composer to the music of Scotland via the pentatonic scale. Its scherzo third movement pays homage to Beethoven's Ninth with a 3/4 molto vivace before the poco sostenuto section recalls his homeland.

answer: Publius Aelius {Hadrianus} Augustus

Four consul members were executed for plotting against this emperor before he entered Rome, and once in Rome he publicly burned records of uncollectable debts. Some historians believe he was given his throne thanks to a fictitious adoption pulled off by Pompeia Plotina just after the death of her husband Trajan. Despite his military background, there was little fighting during his reign other than putting down Bar Kokhba's Revolt in 132 CE. He traveled for over half his reign, inspecting the legions and having them build fortifications on the borders of the Empire. Name this emperor most famous for a namesake wall in Britain.

answer: Gustav Robert {Kirchhoff}

This scientist's namesake equations relate the velocity, angular velocity, and the time-derivative of co-energy to force and moment for rigid objects in inviscid fluids. One of his theories states that at equilibrium, the wavelength- averaged emissivity and reflectivity sum to one; that is this physicist's eponymous law of radiation. He worked with Robert Bunsen to discover rubidium and cesium, and also coined the term “black body”. A set of laws named for this scientist can be derived from the laws of conservation of charge and energy, and state that the current going into a junction equals the current going out of the junction, as well as that the voltage around a closed loop is zero. Identify this German physicist, the namesake of two laws about electrical circuits—the junction and loop rules.

answer: {Boltzmann} constant [accept {k}-{sub}-{B} before it is mentioned; prompt on {k}]

This constant is used in simple gas thermodynamics to find the pressure of a gas, by dividing volume by the product of the number of molecules of gas, the temperature, and it. The average energy per degree of freedom equals one-half the product of this constant with the temperature of a substance. Entropy can be defined as this constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of the number of microstates consistent with the given macrostate. Identify this constant utilized in thermodynamics, commonly denoted k-sub-B and named after an Austrian physicist crucial in developing the field of statistical thermodynamics.

answer: extrasolar {planets} [or {exoplanets}]

Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail found the first confirmed example of one these bodies using pulsar timing, but a more prolific method for their detection is the radial velocity method, which looks for changes in spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. A different method examines changes in brightness of a star due to these objects' transits. Both pulsar timing and radial velocity take advantage of small perturbations in the motion of a star due to one of these orbiting masses. Name these objects found both inside and outside the Solar Systems, examples of which in the solar system include Mars and Jupiter.
