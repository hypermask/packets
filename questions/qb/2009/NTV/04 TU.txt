answer: {oil}-{drop} experiment [accept {Millikan experiment} before the end]

Johnson's shot noise experiment had the same goal as this experiment, which used X-rays to ionize a gap that contained air as a dielectric. This experiment used three spacer balls to separate the plates of its capacitor, which usually reached a potential of about three thousand volts. The fundamental technique of this experiment was to balance the force of gravity with the forces of buoyancy and viscosity, but its result was off by about six percent due mostly to an incorrect value used for the viscosity of air. Name this 1909 experiment to measure the fundamental charge of an electron, conducted by Robert Millikan.

answer: “{Dover Beach”}

Yeats's “The 19th Century and After” was a written response to this poem, which commands the reader to “come to the window”, because “sweet is the night-air”, and also refers to the naked shingles of the world and sounds that Sophocles heard long ago. Those sounds made him think about the “turbid ebb and flow of human misery.” Beginning with, “The sea is calm to-night,” the poem goes on to equate the persistence of waves with an “eternal note of sadness.” Identify this work in which a “tranquil bay” sits near where “the cliffs of England stand”, in a world “where ignorant armies clash by night”, a poem by Matthew Arnold.

answer: Katherine Ann “{Kate}” {Moss}

Described as “the epitome of modern British beauty”, a statue of this woman entitled Siren was given to the British Museum in 2008. She is also the subject of a portrait by Lucien Freud from when she was pregnant with her daughter Lila Grace. In 2005, the Daily Mirror ran front page photos of her snorting cocaine with her then-boyfriend Pete Doherty, causing many of her contracts to be dropped; however, a year later, she rebounded with eighteen contracts, including ones for Nikon, Burberry and YSL. In recent songs, Lily Allen sings of buying jeans so that she can look like this model, while Kanye West sings “You can be my black” version of this model “tonight”. Identify this British supermodel, the epitome of 1990s heroin chic and the waif look.

answer: {Nernst} equation

A modification of this equation gives the resting potential of cell membranes, and because electrons loosely pair up in concentrated solution, this law becomes invalid at high ionic concentrations. It can be derived by taking the Gibbs free energy equation for equilibrium systems and substituting for charge. The main term in this equation is R T over n F, times the natural log of Q. Name this equation that relates the standard electrode potential to the actual cell potential of a voltaic cell.

answer: {cosine} function [or {f} of x equals {cosine} of x, etc.]

One law concerning this function describes the radiant intensity from a certain type of surface, and is named for Lambert. The hyperbolic version of this function defines a catenary, and equals half the quantity e to the x plus e to the negative x. A double-angle identity for this function is that with an input of two theta, it equals the quantity one minus the tangent squared of theta over the quantity one plus the tangent squared of theta. Its Maclaurin series is one minus x squared over two factorial, plus x to the fourth over four factorial, et cetera; and its namesake law generalizes the Pythagorean theorem. Name this trigonometric function that, for an angle in a right triangle, equals the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.

One work by this author opens with the quarrel between Uretsiti and Naotsiti, with the latter becoming a woodrat to escape into the rocks. In addition to Tales of the Cochiti Indians, a work similar to the earlier Zuni Mythology, this author argued in favor of moral relativism in a work that studied the Dobu people as an example of a human culture as a “personality writ large.” She also examined a “shame culture” derived from the concept of giri, although her observations were restricted to internment camps. Name this author of Patterns of Culture and a study of post-World War II Japan, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword.
