answer: {Golgi} apparatus [or {Golgi body}; or {Golgi complex}; etc.]

This object is located on the trans side of the vesicular-tubular cluster, whose interface with it may be described by the “homing in” hypothesis. On its opposite side, the targeting of its trans network is thought to involve mannose-6- phosphate and other molecular tags. Molecules found in this organelle's lumens include glycosidases and kinases, and its tasks include the phosphorylation or cleavage of certain molecules, which are then transported to other organelles, or out of the cell via vesicles.

answer: {beta}-{minus decay} [or {negative beta decay}; accept {electron emission} before the last sentence]

This process violates parity conservation in cobalt-sixty, as discovered by the winners of the 1957 Nobel prize in physics. The distribution of energy from this process was the inspiration for Pauli postulating the neutrino. Fermi's theory about this process includes his “golden rule”, though Fermi did not know that the mechanism for this process is the weak interaction. This event is used to activate a phosphor in tritium illumination, wherein the tritium becomes stable helium. Name this process in which a neutron turns into a proton, an antineutrino, and an electron.

answer: {crystals} [or {crystalline} solids, etc.]

Each of these substances has three numbers associated with it, the Miller indices. One law concerning these substances states that twice the distance between their layers times the sine of the angle of incidence of light equals a whole number of wavelengths. Particles within them have associated quantities describing how many nearest neighbors they have, the coordination number; and depending on whether their corners are identical to their centers, these structures can be simple, body-centered, or face-centered. The aforementioned law is named for a father-and- son pair, the Braggs. Comprised of unit cells forming a lattice, name these types of solids that consist of a regular pattern of constituent molecules, exemplified by quartz.
