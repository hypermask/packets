answer: electronegativity

Sanderson's version of this property allows estimation of bond energies due to known bond lengths, while the Allred-Rochow scale define it in terms of covalent radius.

For 10 points, name this property defined as the tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond.

answer: {recursion} [accept word forms]

Determining a relation of this type is the first step in finding generating functions, and one non-primitive function of this type is the Ackermann function. In computer science, the divide and conquer algorithm solves a problem by forming two problems of half the size and solving each half-problem via this method. This method can be used to generate the factorial because the factorial is n times the factorial of n-1, and the Fibonacci sequence is also defined as this type of sequence because its terms are found from previous terms in the sequence. For 10 points, identify this method, which defines a function's values based on its previous values.

One quantity defined for these objects is given by 2pi times the peak energy stored over cyclical energy dissipated, also known as the quality factor. One example of these objects requires the small angle approximation that sine theta equals theta, and another requires a frictionless surface to avoid damping. These objects exhibit resonance when they are driven at the right angular frequency, which may be square root of L over g or square root of k over m for two examples of these objects. For 10 points, name these objects displaying periodic motion, examples of which include a mass on a spring and a pendulum.
