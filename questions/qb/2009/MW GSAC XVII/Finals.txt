answer: {temperature} [accept {T}]

The Legendre transform of internal energy to yield Helmholtz free energy involves the product of entropy and this quantity. Heat capacity, according to the Debye model, is proportional to the cube of this quantity, and the average kinetic energy of an ideal gas is three-halves times Boltzmann's constant times this quantity. If it has a high value when changes in enthalpy and entropy are both positive, this quantity drives the spontaneity of a reaction. That is because change in Gibbs' free energy is equal to change in enthalpy minus this times change in entropy. For 10 points, name this quantity measured in Kelvins.
