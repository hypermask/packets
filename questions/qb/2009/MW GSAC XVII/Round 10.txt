answer: {diffraction}

The far-field form of this phenomenon is named for Fraunhofer. The Rayleigh criterion gives a resolution limit due to this phenomenon, whose namesake “grating” yields interference patterns. The Huygens principle considers every point of a wave front as a wave source to rationalize this phenomenon.

Its effects can be mathematically determined by setting d sine of theta equal to n lambda. For 10 points, name this phenomenon, the bending of light around a barrier.
