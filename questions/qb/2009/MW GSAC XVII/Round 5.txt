answer: {Snell's} law [accept {Fermat's principle}, {Descartes}' {law}, or {law} of {refraction} before mentioned]

This law is supported by the fact that far from a particular classical path, phase differences are negligible because other paths see destructive interference, also known as Fermat's principle. One quantity in the Fresnel equations must be derived from this law, which Descartes independently discovered as his law of sines. By setting the refracted angle equal to 90 degrees in the associated equation and solving for the incident angle, this law can calculate the conditions necessary to attain total internal reflection, which occurs at the critical angle. For 10 points, identify this law of refraction, stating that n1 sine of theta 1 equals n2 sine of theta 2, as derived by its namesake Dutch scientist.
