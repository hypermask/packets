answer: {angular} momentum [prompt on {L} or {just momentum}]

The commutator of the x and y operators associated with this quantity is i h-bar times the z operator associated with this quantity. This quantity is quantized in units of h-bar, and its conservation leads to an orbiting body increasing its velocity when closer to the body it is orbiting, the result seen in Kepler's second law. The time derivative of this quantity is torque, and this quantity is conserved when there is no external torque acting on the system. For 10 points, name this quantity symbolized L, which is equal to the product of moment of inertia and angular frequency and serves as the rotational analog of linear momentum.

answer: {colligative} properties

One of these phenomena was discovered by Jean Antoine Nollet using a pig bladder, and they can be used in determining molecular weight if the chemical potential of all phases is the same. One law concerning one of these phenomena only applies to mixtures where fugacity can be replaced by simple pressures, which are termed ideal mixtures. That example of these properties is dependent on mole fraction as described by Raoult's law. Aside from vapor pressure, these properties involve the use of the van't Hoff factor. For 10 points, name these concentration-dependent properties of mixtures which include boiling point elevation and freezing point depression.
