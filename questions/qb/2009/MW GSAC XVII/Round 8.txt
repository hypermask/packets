answer: {variable} star

Altair and Denebola fall into the Delta Scuti class of these entities. Rotation with an ellipsoidal shape leads to this classification, and eclipsing binary stars such as Algol are also classified as this. One of this class of stars is the RR Lyrae type, which is among a class with period-luminosity relationship as determined by Henrietta Levitt that occupies the instability strip like many other stars of this type. For 10 points, give this classification of a star that exhibits changing apparent brightness witnessed from Earth, as seen in the Cepheid type.

For one project, this anthropologist displayed human skulls of various races to defend the irrelevance of brain size, and one of his early studies examined the migration patterns of the Inuit.

answer: Erwin {Schrodinger}

This man's most famous paper may be his “Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem”, in which he developed an approach to determine energies of hydrogen-like atoms. That approach relies on an equation he names stating that i h-bar times the time derivative of a function is equal to that function's Hamiltonian. A thought experiment named for this man involves a Geiger counter's detection of an alpha particle causing poison to be released, so the central animal is simultaneously alive and dead. For 10 points, identify this Austrian namesake of a famous wave equation and a thought experiment involving a cat.

answer: Metaphase [prompt on {mitosis} until mentioned]

This process includes the Mad2 protein, which binds to Cdc20, an activator for the next stage after this process. A cell may not progress past this stage if there is not enough tension on spindle fibers. Colchicine is used to arrest this stage so that karyotypes can be made from it, since chromosomes are at their most coiled. Before passing the spindle checkpoint during it, each sister chromatid must be attached via a kinetochore to a spindle fiber. In it, chromosomes line up on the equatorial plate of the cell. For 10 points, name this middle stage of mitosis succeeded by anaphase.
