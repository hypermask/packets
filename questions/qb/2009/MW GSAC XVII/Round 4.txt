answer: odd

There is a bijection between the number of integer partitions with distinct parts and those with parts solely of this type. Functions of this type only have sine terms appearing in their associated Fourier series, and they remain unchanged when rotated 180 degrees about the origin and are therefore symmetric with respect to the origin. Those functions follow the property that f of x equals negative f of negative x, while numbers of this type can generally be written in the form 2n+1. For 10 points, give this adjective describing any whole number that can be expressed as one plus an even number.

answer: Commonwealth of {Australia}

Vince Gair, one of this modern-day country's Senators, was fed ample quantities of prawns by opponents of Gough Whitlam's government so that he would be distracted from resigning and opening up another seat for election.

In its 2007 election, John Howard was replaced by Kevin Rudd as prime minister. For 10 points, name this country with capital at Canberra, home to the Aborigines.

answer: {Hess's} law [accept {law} of {heat summation} or {enthalpy summation} until mentioned]

This law is used to determine entropy and free energy in the Bordwell thermodynamic cycle. As a consequence of this law, one can calculate lattice energy in the Born-Haber cycle. This law works because the quantity it concerns is the sum of internal energy and quantity pressure times volume and is thus a state function. As a result, this law allows for addition of the changes in that quantity for a series of stepwise reactions to determine the overall change in that quantity. For 10 points, name this law which states that adding the change in enthalpy of each step of a reaction yields the total change in enthalpy for the reaction.

The plan of the Pazzi Chapel is often attributed to this architect who designed the domed, cube-shaped Old Sacristy as part of one church he planned, the Basilica of San Lorenzo.

answer: {Michelson}-{Morley} experiment

One follow-up to this experiment concerned the realignment of a parallel-plate capacitor at the Earth's surface. Unlike that related Trouton-Noble experiment, this experiment utilized a device consisting of two perpendicular arms with a beam-splitter located at the intersection, designed to produce different fringe interference patterns dependent on the path of light. Its results suggested that the propagation of light does not change with direction, shown with the use of an interferometer.
