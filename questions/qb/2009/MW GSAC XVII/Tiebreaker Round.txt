answer: George {Santayana}

In one work, this philosopher identified matter, essence, spirit, and truth as the four characteristics of knowledge, and in another work, he argued that one title concept leads to the conclusion that a single instant of awareness is empty of concepts and that the other title concept is the irrational basis for knowledge claims. For 10 points, name this naturalist Spanish-American philosopher who wrote The Realms of Being and Skepticism and Animal Faith and is known for the saying “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

answer: {sea} [Accept The {Sailor Who Fell} From {Grace} With the {Sea} or {Gogo no eik?} before “{also appears}”]

This word concludes the title of a work in which a group of schoolboys murder a kitten and later poison Ryuji before he can marry Noboru's mother because they are disgusted with his change in profession. This word also appears in a metaphorical usage in the title of a series in which Toru is among several characters with three moles under their left arms. That series includes The Decay of the Angel and Spring Snow and follows Kiyoaki's friend Shigekuni Honda. For 10 points, name this body of water from the grace of which a Yukio Mishima sailor has fallen and which also titles his tetralogy.

answer: {Hungarian Revolution} [or “Uprising,” or other {clear} equivalents]

This conflict included a scuffle between protesters trying to enter a radio station and the AVH, a police force, and the policies of Rákosi helped instigate it. During it, Cardinal Mindszenty was released from jail by the new government, and a bronze statue of Stalin was torn down and desecrated at its beginning. It was incited in part by Khrushchev's Secret Speech, and featured the ousting of Erno Gero, who had refused to reform the government. In its final stages, János Kádár was put in power as the head of the Revolutionary Government of Workers and Peasants, and it ended with the removal and execution of Imre Nagy. For 10 points, name this 1956 uprising which was quelled by the Soviets.

answer: {Brownian} motion/dynamics [do not accept “{Brownian diffusion}”]

The Smoluchowski model describing this process considers collisions with a very massive test particle. This process can be mathematically described by considering spatial interactions, a time-dependent noise term, and a parameter from Stokes' law in the Langevin equation. This process can be seen as a small-step limit of a random walk, as it consists of a continuous stochastic process called a Wiener process. Perrin used it to model atomic motion to find Avogadro's number based on Einstein's 1906 description of it. For 10 points, identify this type of motion initially observed in pollen grains by its namesake Scottish botanist.

answer: {weak} nuclear force or interaction

The CKM matrix explains decays due to this type of interaction and has been important in understanding why CP violation can occur for it. This is the only type of interaction capable of changing flavor, and it typically occurs much slower than its counterparts in the Standard Model. Successful unification theories have been able to pair this force with the electromagnetic, and this force can only be mediated by massive gauge bosons such as the W and Z bosons. For 10 points, name this fundamental force that leads to beta decay and is about 10 to the 14th times less intense than the strong force.

answer: {Iroquois} Confederacy/League [or {Six Nations}; prompt on {Five Nations}]

This group's lands in the Shenandoah Valley and south of the Ohio River were ceded with the Treaties of Lancaster and Fort Stanwix. At the Battle of Newtown during the Sullivan Campaign, Loyalists and this group, including followers of one of its war chiefs, Joseph Brant, were defeated by American revolutionaries. They also took the British side in the French and Indian War. Originally from North Carolina, the Tuscarora joined this confederacy of five other tribes such as the Mohawk and Oneida in 1720.

answer: {Sukkoth} [also spelled {Succoth}; accept {Festival} of {Booths} before mentioned]

Prayers said during this festival include the ushpizin, and on the final day of this holiday, seven circuits are made around the synagogue. Like Passover, most of its days are called Chol Ha-Mo'ed and feature relaxed restrictions. Just after it are the holidays of Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah. Observers of this festival use the “Four Species” of plants during the Hallel prayer. It begins on the 15th of Tishri, and during it, participants dwell inside a small hut with two-and-a-half of the walls covered. For 10 points, name this Jewish harvest festival, also called the Festival of Booths.
