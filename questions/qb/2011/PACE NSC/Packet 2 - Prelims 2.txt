One theorem about these numbers states that every natural number can be represented uniquely as the sum of nonconsecutive ones of them; that statement is named for Zeckendorf. This sequence appears on the outer edges of Hosoya’s triangle, and its nth element gives the number of ways for dominoes to cover a two-by-(n minus one) checkerboard. This sequence is generated by a formula named for (*) Binet, as well as by the function x over the quantity one minus x minus x-squared. It is a specific type of Lucas sequence, and the ratio of consecutive elements of this sequence approaches the golden ratio. First proposed in Liber Abaci, for 10 points, name this recursively-defined sequence whose elements are the sum of the previous two elements, beginning 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
