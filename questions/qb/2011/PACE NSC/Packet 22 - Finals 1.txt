answer: linear {independence} [accept word forms]

Two solutions to homogeneous second order linear differential equations with this property have zeroes that alternate according to the Sturm separation theorem. Sets of the edges of a graph possess an analogous property to this one if they make up a forest; that generalization of this property is called a matroid. Reduction of order takes one solution to a differential equation and produces another solution with this property. The (*) columns of a matrix have this property if the matrix has a nonzero determinant. A set with this property that spans a vector space is said to be a basis for that space. For 10 points, name this property possessed by a family of vectors if no vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.

answer: Ptolemy

Beginning with the Battle of Raphia, the fourth ruler of this name heavily employed machimoi, the local militia, when making war. A monarch with this name and the surname Philadelphus was adopted after the first monarch with this name divorced his wife Eurydice and disinherited another son of this name; that latter son of this name was the assassin of Seleucus I. The first monarch of this name used his victory at the Battle of Gaza to control parts of Lebanon not already ceded to him following the Battle of (*) Ipsus in 310 BCE. Most rulers of this name had wives with names like Arsinoe or Berenice. They often fought the rival Diadochi Kingdoms of Seleucia and Macedon, and their namesake dynasty ended with the death of Cleopatra VII. For 10 points, give this common name for Egyptian pharaohs, the first of whom was a general of Alexander the Great.

answer: {symphonies} of Peter Ilyich {Tchaikovsky} [prompt on partial answer]

One of these compositions draws on folk songs like “Spin, My Spinner” and “Let the Crane Soar.” The first of them has a movement subtitled “Land of Desolation, Land of Mists.” In scherzo of the fourth of these, the strings play entirely pizzicato. The last completed one of these works, written in B minor, contains a “limping waltz” in 5/4 time followed by a third movement march before closing with a (*) lamenting adagio. The fourth of these was dedicated to Nadezhda von Meck. These works include the “Polish” and “Winter Dreams,” and an unnumbered one of these works was based on Lord Byron’s Manfred. For 10 points, name this set of works, which include the “Little Russian” and “Pathétique,” written by the composer of The 1812 Overture.

In one work, this poet narrates his experience going into a “long bay” “out of time’s monotone,” where he “affected” a “day of piracy” and “devoured the very plates Aeneas bore.” This poet of “The Mediterranean” built the reputation of the Sewanee Review and described a jaguar who “leaps for his own image in a jungle pool” in a work that prophesies, “you will curse the setting sun.” His best known work tells how “the (*) leaves/flying, plunge, and expire,” describes “row after row with strict impunity” and cries out “Stonewall, Stonewall” and “Shiloh, Antietam.” For 10 points, name this Fugitive poet and Southern Agrarian who wrote “Ode to the Confederate Dead.”

answer: orbital {hybridization}

This phenomenon is complicated by experimental evidence of a 12.7 eV and a 23 eV band both being present in the photoelectron spectrum of methane. Inaccurate models invoke this phenomenon to explain phosphorus pentachloride's apparent octet rule violation. The results of this phenomenon have adequate (*) overlap and directionality to form linear combinations that give molecular orbitals. A byproduct formed by orbitals that do not participate in this phenomenon is a pi bond. For 10 points, name this phenomenon wherein atomic orbitals mix in order to form bonds and which may be, for example, “sp2” or “sp3.”

answer: {lac} operon

This structure’s activity can be measured by the breakdown of ONPG and formation of the yellow orthonitrophenol. One mutation in it is tested for using phenyl-Gal. Two of its structural elements produce a detoxifying transacetylase and a permease. CAP forms a complex with cAMP to allow (*) RNA polymerase to bind to its weak promoter; this allows glucose to downregulate its activity. The repressor produced by this element’s I gene is inhibited by the allo- form of the sugar that beta-galactosidase, one of its gene products, breaks down. For 10 points, name this operon that regulates the catabolism of a sugar found in milk.

During the aforementioned Transylvanian campaign they were led by Hermann von Salza. Their decline is often traced to a decisive loss at the First Battle of Tannenberg in 1410, a battle also called Grunwald. This order was formed during the Siege of Acre to provide relief to the sick and wounded. For 10 points, name this medieval crusading order of German knights.
