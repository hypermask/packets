answer: {searching} algorithms [accept {binary searching algorithms} before “{probability}” is read]

Joshua Bloch famously admitted that his implementation of an algorithm to do this for the Java Development Kit could lead to an integer overflow error because of a line that added low and high values and dived by two. This operation can be performed with a high probability of success in Big O of N to the one half time using a quantum computing algorithm called Grover’s Algorithm.
