answer: {coagulation} [accept blood {clotting} before mention; accept {logical} equivalents]

The formation of tenase complex is key to this process, and one variant of a disorder in which it does not occur properly is called Christmas disease. This process is promoted by a protein named for Hageman, and VKORC is inhibited by the drug warfarin in order to prevent it. This process is initiated upon the exposure and binding to (*) collagen of von Willebrand factor.

answer: {histones}

Phosphorylation of a serine residue of one variety of these structures helps the cell pinpoint the location of DNA damage. Important modifiers of these structures include factors like CREB binding protein and p300. Lysine residues on the N-terminal domains of these proteins are (*) acetylated and various other residues are methylated to turn transcription on and off, respectively. The “linking” type of them connects the entry and exit sites of an octameric assembly of the “core” type; that assembly is called the nucleosome. For 10 points, name these spool-like proteins around which DNA wraps to form chromatin.

Prior to this battle, the victorious commander was able to establish a beachhead by winning the Battle of Cirta, and after this battle that commander demanded ten thousand silver talents from the losing side but did not destroy their capital. Laelius led a successful counter-charge in this battle after his allies placed velites in gaps and simultaneously played trumpets to repel one attack. Some troops here were commanded by Syphax, while a critical moment came when the losing side’s rear was attacked by (*) Masinissa’s cavalry. It concluded a campaign begun at the Battle of Utica. Earlier in this battle, the losing side unleashed an unsuccessful charge of some eighty elephants. For 10 points, name this defeat for Hannibal by Scipio Africanus, the final major battle in the Second Punic War.

Michel Corrette reworked the first of these pieces into the motet Laudate Dominum de coelis. That work includes violas imitating a barking dog. Another one of these contains a caccia, a type of canon which reflects a hunt. The second of these works includes in its first movement imitations of various bird calls and has a hailstorm in the third movement.

A controversy exists over the calculation of this quantity for electromagnetic waves in dielectrics between equations proposed by Minkowski and by Abraham; Barnett suggests that one equation gives the kinetic and the other gives the canonical form of this quantity. This quantity is always equal to the Planck constant over an object's (*) de Broglie wavelength. Special relativity sets the square of energy equal to c to the fourth times invariant mass squared plus c squared times this quantity squared. This quantity is conserved in all closed system collisions, whether elastic or inelastic. For 10 points, name this quantity, equal to the product of mass and velocity.

answer: {prisoner’s dilemma}

This scenario was used to model the evolution of reciprocal altruism in a 1971 paper by Robert Trivers. Proposed by Merril Flood and Melvin Dresher, this scenario tends to be defined by the conditions T greater than R greater than P greater than S, though related variants relax some of those conditions. A tournament of its iterated variant was proposed by Robert (*) Axelrod and won by Anatol Rapoport’s “tit for tat” strategy. For 10 points, name this zero-sum problem of game theory, whose title characters must agree either to stick to their story or to rat each other out.

Veselago demonstrated that metamaterials with both negative permittivity and permeability may display this property in the reverse sense. This phenomenon may happen different for oppositely-handed circular polarizations in the Faraday effect and is said to happen “double” in materials like calcite, which are (*) birefringent. This phenomenon is modeled by setting the ratio of the sines of the angles in question equal to the reciprocal ratio of the indices of the media. For 10 points, name this phenomenon, wherein a change in wave speed results in a change in wave direction.
