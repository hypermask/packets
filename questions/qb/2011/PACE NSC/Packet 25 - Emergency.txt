answer: {four color} theorem

This statement is the special case of a conjecture involving the floor function of the expression seven plus the square root of one plus forty-eight times the genus, all over two. That conjecture was proven by Ringel and Youngs. An unsolved generalization of this statement is known as the (*) Hadwiger conjecture.

He names an approach to quantum mechanics where the state vectors are time-independent but the operators are time-dependent. Independent of John Wheeler, this physicist developed the S-matrix to represent scattering outcomes. He names a thought experiment wherein the light passing through a microscope induces a Compton recoil in an electron. This formulator with Born and Jordan of the (*) matrix formulation of quantum mechanics suggests that due to a positive lower limit on the commutator between conjugate variables, quantities such as position and momentum cannot be simultaneously known to infinite precision. For 10 points, name this physicist, whose foundational work in quantum mechanics included developing the uncertainty principle.
