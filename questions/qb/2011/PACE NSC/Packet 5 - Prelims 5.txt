answer: {sickle cell} anemia

Infant dactylitis, or swelling of one or more digits, is an early sign of this disease. Prophylactic penicillin and hydroxyurea are used to treat it, and people with this disease often suffer splenic infarction and subsequently have the spleen removed. A point mutation that leads to this disease causes a sixth-residue (*) glutamine to change to a valine. Possessing one allele with this disease’s causative mutation confers resistance to malaria. The aggregation of the beta-globin chains of hemoglobin blocks blood vessels and leads to this disease’s namesake “crises.” For 10 points, name this disease most common in people of African descent that causes blood cells to form a namesake abnormal curved shape.

Foot and Lew proposed certain complementarity relations between these particles and another group of particles whose masses are related by the Koide formula. The relative likelihood of one type of these particles turning into another type is given by the CKM matrix. These particles cannot be isolated due to a property called confinement, and the force that governs them is weakest when they are nearest each other, a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom. That force is mediated by (*) gluons. For 10 points, name these particles with fractional electric charge named by Murray Gell-Mann, which combine in threes and twos to form hadrons and mesons, such as the pion and proton, examples of which include the strange, up, and down types.
