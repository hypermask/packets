Description acceptable. This object is lost at a drunken party whence its owner does not return “with ivy leaves in his hair,” as his lover had hoped. Unlike its author’s previous work, which had dealt with history up to the present day, this work forecasts the development of the future. This object’s owner dies when he goes to Miss Diana’s soiree to try and retrieve it. At the end of the play, it is revealed that the notes used to write this still exist, inspiring (*) Thea Elvsted to try and reconstruct it. By publishing this work, its author could take the university professorship already promised to his friend, George Tesman. For 10 points, name this object, which the title character of an Ibsen play throws into the fire.

answer: {Alfonso} [or {Afonso}]

Nzinga Mbemba, a ruler of the Kongo Kingdom, took this name after converting to Catholicism. The last monarch of this name from one country was almost assassinated with his wife Victoria Eugenie on his wedding day and was blamed for his country’s defeat at the Battle of Annual in Morocco. An earlier king with this name had a court that produced a law code called the Siete partidas; that tenth king of this name was known as (*) “the Wise”. Yet another king of this name called “the Brave” saw his anti-Muslim policies provoke a 1086 invasion from the Almoravids and ceded the eastern portion of his kingdom to El Cid. The aforementioned last king with this name foolishly allied himself with a dictator of his country, Primo de Rivera. For 10 points, give this common name of some thirteen kings of Spain.

The height of these structures was found by Graf to be the strongest predictor of whether they are empty. William White suggested that the primary force acting on these entities is floor deepening rather than headward sapping, noting that cols, or passes, rarely form in them. Parallel to the back wall of one of these there can form a randkluft or a bergschrund. These objects are bounded on two sides by the headwall and the sill, and many contain lakes called (*) tarns, which form from icemelt. The erosion of two of these structures towards each other can form an arête. For 10 points, name these amphitheatre-shaped rock formations that form at the head of valley glaciers.

This city was the base for a project that sent photographers across its country to capture its landmarks; that project was called the Heliographic Mission. A man with a striped hat sulks and looks away from a woman smoking in a photograph set in a bar in this city, Brassaï’s Lovers’ Quarrel. Berenice Abbott championed a man who documented this city; his photographs of it include one of a display of corsets in a store window and another showing a crowd looking up at an eclipse. One picture set in this city shows a man in mid-stride about to hit the wet ground which reflects his image, an example of its photographer’s (*) “decisive moments.” Charles Marville and Eugène Atget extensively photographed this city before and after Baron Haussman’s modernization of it. For 10 points, name this city, the setting of an Henri Cartier-Bresson landscape that includes the Eiffel Tower.

answer: the great state of {California}

In November 2010, a national panic over a “mystery missile” flying over this state was resolved the same day a city in this state struck a blow against obesity by banning Happy Meal toys. This state was the site of the 2009 shooting of Oscar Grant by transportation policemen, and a May 2011 Supreme Court decision found prison overcrowding in this state to violate prisoners’ Eighth Amendment rights. An appeal in a suit filed by Kristin M. Perry against this state alleges that (*) Vaughn Walker was biased for not revealing his sexual preferences before deciding that a particular ballot initiative violated due process and equal protection; the appeals process for that case is complicated by the fact that Gerry Brown’s government does not want to pursue it. For 10 points, name this state known for Proposition 8 and the love child of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

One incident indicative of the problems in these entities was Girl X’s rape and poisoning in 1997, and some of these entities were established by the 1937 Wagner-Steagall Act. Particularly bad examples of these entities are supposed to be revitalized by HOPE VI. Many of these entities are supervised by a cabinet department whose first head was African American Robert C. Weaver and whose current head is Shaun Donovan. FDR presided over the creation of (*) Techwood, the first of these entities in the United States that was located in Atlanta.

This process employs a submonolayer of potassium covering the catalyst as an electronic promoter, a configuration protected against sintering by a framework of alumina and calcium oxide, which work as structural promoters. Alwin Mittasch developed the modern, cheaper catalyst for this process. The elucidation of this process's mechanism won the 2007 Nobel Prize for Gerhard (*) Ertl. The occasional second namesake of this process received that credit for his design of an industrial-scale cast iron reactor that could withstand the two hundred atmospheres and five hundred degrees Celsius necessary to break the triple bond concerned.
