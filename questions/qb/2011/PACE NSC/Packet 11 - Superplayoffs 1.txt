answer: string {quartets} [prompt on {quartet}]

Alban Berg’s Lyric Suite was originally composed in this form, and Beethoven wrote three of these called the “Rasumovsky” ones. One piece of this type begins in 9/8 and has an andante cantabile second movement; that is the first of these by Pyotr Tchaikovsky. One of these by Franz Schubert ends with a tarantella and is called Death and the Maiden. Many modern compositions of this type are commissioned by a group named for (*) Kronos. A famous one of these by Antonín Dvo?ák was composed in Spillville, Iowa, giving it the nickname “American.” An adagio movement from one by Samuel Barber is frequently played on its own. For 10 points, name this type of composition for an ensemble consisting of two violins, a viola, and a cello.

answer: {symmetric} matrices [accept word forms; prompt on {matrix} before “{types} of” is read]

A process named for Cholesky decomposes these objects into the product of a lower- triangular matrix with its adjoint. These objects are always orthogonally diagonalizable, and are positive- definite if and only if all their eigenvalues are positive. Different eigenspaces of these objects produce orthogonal eigenvectors, and according to the (*) spectral theorem, these objects always have orthonormal bases of eigenvectors; thus, all these types of matrices’ eigenvalues are real. Generalized by Hermitian matrices, for 10 points, name these types of matrices that are equal to their transpose, with entries i,j always equal to entries j,i.

This substance can be broken down by COMT in the prefrontal cortex, which it connects to the ventral tegmental area via the mesocortical pathwayl. It can also operate via the tuberoinfundibular pathway, and it inhibits the secretion of prolactin. This precursor of norepinephrine is primarily produced in the (*) substantia nigra. Deficiency of this catecholamine can cause a degenerative disease whose most visible symptom is persistent tremors, since this neurotransmitter helps carry out voluntary movement. It is also associated with reward-seeking and pleasure behaviors. For 10 points, name this neurotransmitter whose deficiency leads to Parkinson’s disease and whose precursor is L-dopa.
