answer: {restriction} enzymes [or {restriction endonucleases}]

The first of these proteins to be discovered was isolated from Haemophilus influenzae, and, like many of its class, that example is nonfunctional when its target is methylated. Only one of their three types does not require ATP to function, and two of their types require AdoMet to function. Analysis by (*) Southern blot may require a sample to be digested by these proteins, common examples of which are Xbal and EcoRI. These proteins create either sticky or blunt ends when they cleave at certain sequences, which are often palindromic. For 10 points, name this class of enzyme often used in experiments to cleave DNA at specific sites.

answer: {Bahá'í} faith

Historical accounts of this faith include God Passes By, which recounts a declaration in the garden of Ridvan.

A law passed after this event provided restrictions on successive habeas corpus briefs and is commonly called AEDPA. Stephen Jones, the defense lawyer for one man involved in this incident, wrote the book Others Unknown that implicated a group from nearby Elohim City. For his complicity in this event, Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison. A famous photo of its aftermath showed Baylee Almon being held by (*) firefighter Charles Porter.

answer: {insulators} [accept {dielectrics} before mention]

These objects, which are often assembled in modular cap and pin designs, can fail due to thresholds on “puncture” and “flashover.” One type of these objects are transition metal oxides with a Coulomb potential more than twice the number of neighboring atoms times the transfer integral and were predicted by Nevill (*) Mott. One of these materials separates two conductors in a capacitor. These materials, which possess a characteristic breakdown voltage, have a large band gap due to their tightly bound valence electrons. For 10 points, name these materials, also called dielectrics, that resist current flow.

The standard in this case was limited in Whitney vs. California, which replaced it with the nebulous “bad tendency” standard. The material tested in this case included leaflets distributed that urged people not to “submit to intimidation.” Brandenburg vs Ohio superseded entirely the test from this case with its “imminent lawless action” test; that test, established in this case with the example of (*) “shouting fire in a crowded theater,” is the clear and present danger test.

answer: surface {area}

Shrake and Rupley introduced a rolling ball algorithm to calculate a form of this quantity applied to biomolecules that had been developed earlier by Lee and Richards. The polar form of this quantity should be limited to sixty square angstroms for molecules intended to cross the blood-brain barrier. Schwarz demonstrated that different methods of approximating this quantity, unlike (*) arc length, as using limiting polyhedra can give different values. This quantity is infinite in Gabriel's horn, and the folds formed by the mitochondrial inner membrane exist to maximize this quantity. Its ratio to volume is minimized for the sphere. For 10 points, name this measure of a solid, equal for a sphere to four times pi times the radius squared.
