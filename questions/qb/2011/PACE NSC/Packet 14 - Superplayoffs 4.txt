answer: {collagen}

A disease caused by a mutation in one gene coding for this protein involves symptoms like “basket-weave” kidneys and kidney scarring and is called Alport syndrome. Integrin is key in binding it to cell membranes, and cortisol stimulates the degradation of this protein. The lens of the (*) eye contains its crystalline form, and vitamin C is a cofactor in this protein’s synthesis. The amino acid sequence glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline is abundant in its triple-helical structure, and this protein’s Type I is mineralized to form bone. For 10 points, name this protein that gives teeth, skin, and bones their tensile strength, the most abundant protein in the human body.

answer: {apoptosis}

This process is inhibited by the PI3K pathway, and it can be initiated upon the binding of Apo-1 to Fas receptors, which leads to the formation of DISC complexes. Proteins in the Bcl2 family inhibit this process, while proteins like Bax and (*) Bad promote it. This process, which occurs 191 times during C. elegans development, can be initiated upon an increase in p53 concentration due to DNA damage. It occurs upon the release of cytochrome c from the inner membrane of the mitochondria, which activates a caspase cascade. The action of those proteases leads to blebbing and the eventual fragmentation of the cell. For 10 points, name this process of controlled cell death.

One of these objects results from compactifying the union of infinity and the complex numbers; that one, equivalent to the extended complex plane, is named for Riemann. The homeomorphic relation between simply connected, closed 3-manifolds and a type of these was shown in Grigori Perelman’s proof of the Poincaré conjucture. A lack of Lebesgue measure in fragments of these helps resolve the (*) Banach-Tarski paradox, which considers the set of points bounded by one of these, cuts it into pieces, and constructs two equivalent objects. Diametrically opposite points on these are called antipodes, and the angle phi joins theta in their namesake coordinates, in which rho signifies distance from the origin. For 10 points, name these objects whose enclosed volume is four-thirds pi r cubed.
