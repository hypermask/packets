answer: Pierre de {Fermat}

This mathematician names the identity that n choose k equals the sum from i equals k to n of i minus 1 choose k minus 1. The statement that local extrema of functions have a vanishing first derivative is his theorem of stationary points. This mathematician used the method of descent to prove the n equals 4 case of one of his statements, and also stated that light rays travel to minimize the time taken, his principle of (*) least time. Another law named for him states that for any a coprime to a prime p, a to the quantity p minus 1 is congruent to 1 mod p; that is his Little Theorem. For 10 points, identify this namesake of a theorem proven by Andrew Wiles, stating that for there are no integer solutions to x to the n plus y to the n equals z to the n for n greater than two—his namesake Last Theorem.

answer: {electronegativity}

This quantity for a compound is the geometric mean of this quantity for each atom in that compound according to its principle of equalization. Slater's rules and the covalent radius of an atom are used to calculate this quantity according to the Allred-Rochow scale.

Scales for this quantity, which increases with movement up and to the right on the periodic table, are named for Pauling and Mulliken. For 10 points, name this quantity that measures the affinity of an atom for electrons.
