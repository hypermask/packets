answer: {bond angle} [accept anything that indicates understanding that we're looking for the angle between bonds to an atom]

This quantity is given in terms of the s and p character of orbitals by Coulson's theorem, and it is predicted to be larger for singlet carbenes than triplets. An attempt to reconcile the optimal value of this quantity with that which is demanded by small cyclic hydrocarbons results in banana bonds. This quantity is dramatically smaller than predicted for hydrogen (*) disulfide because of lone pair donation into sigma star orbitals. This quantity is decreased in VSEPR theory when one replaces a substituent with an electron pair, because the electron pair is more repulsive and compresses the other substituents. For 10 points, give this measure, equal to approximately 109.5 degrees for methane and 104.5 degrees for water.

answer: {particle accelerators}

Fixed-field alternating gradient ones are employed in anti-cancer proton therapy. Early examples used sulfur hexafluoride to apply a static voltage of around thirty megavolts, while oscillating voltages are employed in more modern linear examples.

answer: {geometric} series

A curious one of these entities, which can be said to be equal to 1 or 0, is named for Grandi. Archimedes used one of these objects to calculate the area of the title conic section in his treatise The Quadrature of the Parabola. The St. Ives riddle can be restated as solving a finite one of these. The (*) “hyper-” form of these entities involves summing rational functions of k; that is, the quotient of polynomials P(k) and Q(k). These converge if the absolute value of the power of each term is less than 1, in which case they are equal at infinity to 1 over the quantity 1 minus the first term. For 10 points, name these series which consist of terms r to the k summed over k, which are often contrasted with arithmetic series.

One phenomenon that happens under this condition occurs in the presence of two narrowly separated metal plates; it is characterized by a force proportional to the negative fourth power of their separation. A difference between the energy of the 2s and 2p energy levels owes to the interaction between electrons and this entity.
