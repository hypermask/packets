answer: {surface tension}

The equation that balances a pressure difference against this force times twice the mean curvature is given by Young and Laplace. Mass transport due to differentials in this force is named for Marangoni. Molecules with nonpolar and polar ends, which often may be used as (*) detergents or emulsifiers, act to decrease it; they are called surfactants. This force, which causes capillary action, arises in its namesake location because cohesive forces are exerted from only one direction, unlike in the bulk fluid. For 10 points, name this force present at the surface of a liquid.
