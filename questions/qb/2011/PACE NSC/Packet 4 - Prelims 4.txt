answer: even

Binary codes with this property have generator polynomials that include a factor of 1 + x. If a finite group does not have this property, then the Feit-Thompson theorem guarantees that it is solvable. Permutations that possess this property form a subgroup of all permutations called the (*) alternating group, and they all have Levi-Civita symbol equal to positive one. Functions with this property have Fourier expansions that consist only of cosines, since for cosines f(x) = f(-x) (“eff of x equals eff of negative x”); by definition, such functions exhibit reflectional symmetry over the y-axis. For 10 points, name this property shared by numbers divisible by two.

answer: vitamin {D}

This vitamin promotes cathelicidin production.

It amplifies natural killer cell activity, and overconsumption of it can cause hypertension and kidney stones. The liver converts it to calcidiol, which the kidneys convert to the (*) secosteroid hormone calcitriol. Deficiency of this vitamin causes osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children, both of which are characterized by softening of the bones.
