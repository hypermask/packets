answer: multi-dimensional {arrays}

When these data structures have a low stride they are stored contiguously in memory, which increases throughput. One of these objects is created after determining the min and max of the items to be sorted when implementing counting sort. A form of these objects are implemented using either row-major or column-major order, and full heaps can efficiently be stored using one of these data structures. Dynamic forms of these data structures allow for their size to be increased while still maintaining close to the (*) constant time needed to read and write from them. Multi-dimensional forms of this data structure can be used to represent matrices, and they are often iterated through using for loops. For 10 points, name this simple data structure declared using square brackets in languages with C syntax.
