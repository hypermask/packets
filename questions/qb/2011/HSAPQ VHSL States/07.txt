answer: supernova

The r-process refers to rapid neutron capture during these phenomena. One type of these phenomena is useful for measuring distances in excess of one thousand megaparsecs. Another type of these phenomena lack hydrogen lines and generally occur above the Chandrasekhar limit. The abundance of the heavy elements can be explained by their nuclear synthesis during these phenomena, and the Crab Nebula was formed by one of these phenomena. In white dwarfs above 1.44 solar masses, this event leads to the formation of a black hole. For 10 points, name these extremely energetic explosions of stars.

answer: {macrophages}

The anti-EMR1 monoclonal antibody binds specifically to these cells, and they also express CD68 and CD14. So-called “Heart Failure Cells” are created when these cells become laden with hemosiderin, and in atherosclerotic [ah-thuh-ROH-skleh-RAW-tik] plaques they become foam cells. One variant of these cells line the walls of liver sinusoids and are called Kupffer cells, and these cells’ main function is triggered by activation of toll-like receptors, followed by actin polymerization. These cells differentiate from monocytes. They express MHC class II, which with they present antigens to helper T cells.

answer: {viscosity}

For an ideal gas, this quantity can be derived from temperature using Sutherland's formula. This quantity can be mathematically represented by tensors of fourth or higher orders. Bingham plastics can experience a dramatic increase in this property at high stresses, though at low stresses it instead is characterized by an amalgamation of this term and "elastic." Thixotropic and rheopectic materials respectively decrease and increase this property over time, much like the processes of shear thinning and shear thickening. This value is non-constant for non-Newtonian fluids, such as blood and ketchup. Analogous to friction, for 10 points, identify this term for a fluid's resistance to flow.
