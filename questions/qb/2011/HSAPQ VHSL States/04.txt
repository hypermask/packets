answer: blood {clotting} [accept word forms; accept thrombosis before “thrombus” is mentioned; accept

This process consists of the extrinsic pathway followed by the intrinsic pathway, which produces kallikrein (kal-ih-KREE-in). Those two pathways are this process’s namesake "cascade." Those who cannot do it may suffer from Christmas disease or a defective von Willebrand factor. It converts fibrinogen, or Factor 1, to fibrin, which polymerizes (puh-LIM-uh-"rises") to form a thrombus. A defect in Factor 8 of this process causes hemophilia A, which is the inability of the body to perform this process. It is also called coagulation. For 10 points, name this process in which platelets form to stop bleeding.

answer: index of {refraction} [prompt on {n}]

Evanescent waves increase, rather than decrease, in material with a negative value for this quantity, though such materials must be artificially engineered to have a negative permeability. This value appears squared as a function of frequency in the Frank-Tamm formula, which gives the energy emitted by particles traveling faster than the speed of light. The sine of the angle of incidence, divided by that of the angle of transmission, gives the ratio of this quantity for two different materials, via Snell’s Law. For 10 points, name this measure of the speed of light in a material relative to that in a vacuum.
