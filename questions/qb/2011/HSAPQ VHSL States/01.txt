answer: {Coriolis} force [or equivalents for force like "effect"]

A small value for the Rossby number indicates a significant effect caused by this force. Its root cause is the unequal rates of rotation for the Earth; the fastest rate is at the equator thus causing an object traveling south from the equator to deviate westward. The effect of this force is proportional to two times the rotation rate of the Earth times the sine of the angle of the latitude, thus this force causes no effect at the equator. For 10 points, name this apparent deflection of an object by inertial forces in a rotating frame of reference which is partially responsible for the rotation of hurricanes but not the flow of water in a toilet.

The magnetic field of these objects can be described using the London equations, and they can be described mathematically with the Ginzburg-Landau theory. One theory describing them notes that electrons below the Fermi level can bind together to form Cooper pairs. YBCO is notable for acting as one of these materials above the boiling point of nitrogen. These materials experience an expulsion of their magnetic field in a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect and can be described by the BCS theory. For 10 points, name this type of material, which as its name suggests has an electrical resistivity of zero.

One equation that improves upon this law exhibits oscillatory behavior that is corrected by Maxwell’s equal area rule. This law can be derived by assuming that kinetic energy is equal to one half Boltzmann’s constant times temperature and by assuming that collisions off a wall are perfectly elastic.
