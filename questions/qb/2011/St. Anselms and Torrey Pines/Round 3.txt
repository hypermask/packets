answer: {Maxwell’s} Equations

This set of statements was compiled Oliver Heaviside and these statements allowed for the discovery that the inverse of the square root of the product of the permittivity and permeability constants of free space was equal to the speed of light. The electromagnetic wave equation can be derived from these statements and one of these statements is used to determine the magnetic field created by a [*] current and includes a namesake displacement correction. Two are named after a German mathematician, one after Faraday, and one after Ampère. For 10 points, name this set of partial differential equations including Gauss’s Law, codified by a Scottish scientist.

answer: {angular momentum} [do not accept or prompt on “momentum”]

The quantum coupling of this quantity is described using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. If a system’s Lagrangian is rotationally invariant, this quantity is conserved due to Noether’s Theorem. For atomic orbitals, this quantity, represented as the azimuthal quantum number, must be an integer multiple of h bar, and its intrinsic form was quantized in the Stern-Gerlach experiment and is called [*] spin. Both Kepler’s Second Law and gyroscopes demonstrate the conservation of this quantity in the absence of net external torque. For 10 points, name this cross product of position and linear momentum, symbolized with L.
