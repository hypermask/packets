In one of this man’s experiments, individuals in Wichita and Omaha were starting points while individuals in Boston were ending points. Those cities were selected for their social and geographical disparities in this man’s [*] Small World experiment. That experiment yielded the this man’s “six degrees of separation.” This man conducted a study in which subjects believed they were administering increasingly harsh shocks to a “learner” with a heart condition. For 10 points, identify this psychologist who conducted an eponymous experiment in a Yale University basement that found alarming results about obedience.

answer: {factorial}

Fermat’s little theorem can be used to prove that this function of a prime minus one equals negative one modulo that prime according to Wilson’s theorem. When this function’s argument is downshifted by one, the gamma function results. The natural log of this function of n is equal to n log n minus n for very large n according to [*] Stirling’s approximation. This function appears in the denominator of all the terms of the Taylor series, and it is used to calculate binomial coefficients with combinations. For 10 points, name this function of n equal to the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n, symbolized with an exclamation point.

One character in this work used to work in a “black hole” of a newspaper office filled with men in shirt-sleeves, a state detested by another character who has a vision of Peter dancing with her sister Olga. In this work, a call-bell is broken, but a door opens when asked to, even though a man refuses to walk through it to prove he is not a coward. In this play, a woman who drowned her baby and another who was a [*] lesbian postal clerk are brought by a never-blinking valet to a hotel room with Second Empire furniture. Ending with Estelle stabbing Inez after Garcin proclaims, “hell is other people,” for 10 points, name this existential play by Jean-Paul Sartre.

answer: {pragmatism}

One proponent of this philosophy argued that other philosophies failed due to projecting the results of abstractions onto reality. A belief that truth is only a tag that people bestow upon claims in order to present their views was written by Richard Rorty, while another advocate of this philosophy discussed semiosis, or sign action, and the three basic elements that make up objects and their meanings in his work How to Make Our Ideas Clear. That man, [*] C. S. Peirce, founded this philosophy which was later expounded upon by John Dewey. For 10 points, name this philosophy that believes that thoughts are only true if they are practical, popularized by William James.
