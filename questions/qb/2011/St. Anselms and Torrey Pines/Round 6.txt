answer: {bystander} effect [accept “{Kitty Genovese syndrome}” before “{Genovese}”]

A variant on this effect was observed in a rope-pulling experiment conducted by Max Ringelmann. This effect was first demonstrated in 1968 by Darley and Latane. In one experiment on this effect, participants completed questionnaires while a room filled with smoke. This effect’s causes include [*] pluralistic ignorance, deference to qualified authority, and diffusion of responsibility. Good Samaritan laws combat this effect, which was observed during Winton Moseley’s murder of Kitty Genovese. For 10 points, identify this psychological effect that results in a reduced likelihood of one person helping another when in a group of observers.

answer: Michelson-Morley Experiment

This experiment was replicated with erroneous results by Dayton Miller. This experiment was replicated with a self-orienting capacitor by Trouton and Noble, and its central device was shortened in the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment. The Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction sought to explain the results of this experiment, in which [*] light was split with a half-silvered mirror. This experiment proved that the speed of light does not depend on the viewer’s movement through space.
