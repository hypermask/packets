answer: {photoelectric} effect

This phenomenon’s namesake spectroscopy can be used to determine the binding energy of a material. This effect experiences no detectable time lag due to ambient radiation. The work function over Planck’s constant equals the threshold frequency of this effect. The use of induction coils with spark gaps bombarded by ultraviolet light allowed [*] Heinrich Hertz to discover this effect. According to Lenard, the kinetic energy of the resulting particles is intensity-independent and varies with the wavelength of the incident radiation in this effect. For 10 points, name this effect by which photons hitting a surface cause emission of electrons, the explanation of which won Einstein his Nobel Prize.

answer: Szent-Györgyi-{Krebs} cycle [accept “{citric acid cycle}” before mentioned; or {tricarboxylic acid cycle}]

In this process, calcium activates isocitrate dehydrogensase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. In this process, succinate dehydrogenase turns succinate into fumarate. Electrons produced in this process transform [*] FAD+ into FADH2, which re-donates those electrons in a later process. NADH also stores electrons from this process that begins with the reaction of oxaloacetate with acetyl CoA, which is created before this process from pyruvate. Succeeding glycolysis and preceding the electron transport chain, for 10 points, name this cycle also known as the citric acid cycle, part of cellular respiration.

A set of laws which equates this process’s flux to the product of namesake coefficient and the first derivative of position was derived from the continuity equation. Another equation that governs this process states that its rate is inversely proportional to the square root of mass. This process is governed by Fick’s Laws and Graham’s Law. A specific type of this process involves movement from [*] hypotonic to hypertonic solutions; that form is specific for water moving across a semipermeable membrane and is called osmosis. For 10 points, name this process in which particles move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.
