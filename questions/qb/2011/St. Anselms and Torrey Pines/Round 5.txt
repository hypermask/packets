answer: {Hooke’s} law of elasticity

One tensor associated with this statement is simplified by Voight notation to a six by six matrix, and it was generalized to three dimensions by Cauchy. This statement can be applied to isotropic materials with Poisson’s ratio. The anisotropic form of this equation expressed results in the stiffness tensor. Cross-sectional area over length times [*]Young’s Modulus equals the force constant of this law, which fails beyond the elastic limit of the yield strength. For 10 points, name this law stating that the restoring force experienced by an object is directly proportional to the displacement, or that stress is proportional to strain, often applied to springs.
