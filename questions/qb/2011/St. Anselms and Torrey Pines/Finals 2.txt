answer: {coagulation} [or {thrombosis}; accept {blood clotting} and word forms before mentioned]

Because this process uses VKORC to recycle components, it can be inhibited by a coumarin derivative called warfarin. Tissue factor initiates the extrinsic pathway of this process, and when endothelial cells are damaged, its von Willebrand factor bonds to collagen. This process is inhibited by Bernard-Souleir syndrome and by another disorder caused by a lack of [*] factor VIII, disrupting this process’s namesake cascade. In this process, thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin strands that assist the platelet plug in closing the wound. Disrupted in hemophiliacs, for 10 points, name this process by which blood clots.
