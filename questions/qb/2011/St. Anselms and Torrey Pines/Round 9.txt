answer: {prime} [or {primality}; accept {prime numbers}; accept {primes}]

This property is tested for by Proth’s theorem, and GIMPS is searching for numbers with this property. A theorem about this property states that the distribution of numbers with it is approximately n over log n, and numbers with it separated by two are called “twins.” Other kinds of these numbers are named for [*] Fermat and Mersenne, and Goldbach’s conjeture states that every even integer greater than two can be written as the sum of two numbers with this property. Euler proved that there are infinitely numbers with this property, which can be found with the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For 10 points, name this property of numbers whose only factors are one and themselves.

answer: prophase

This process has a “pre” version which sees a namesake band form around the phragmosome.
