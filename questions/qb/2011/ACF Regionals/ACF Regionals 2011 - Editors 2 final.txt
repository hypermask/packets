answer: {P} [or early polynomial time]

Steve’s class adds a spatial constraint to this class, and an open problem concerns whether Nick’s class equals this class. The Klee-Minty cubes show that the simplex method is not in this class, while Khachian’s ellipsoid method was the first example of a linear programming solution in this class. By Schaefer’s dichotomy theorem, the Boolean satisfiability theorem for both Horn and anti-Horn formulas is in this class, and for any formula is either in this complexity class or in NP-complete. This complexity class contains problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine. For 10 points, name this class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time, which may or may not equal NP.

Like the British Israelites, that group believes that the inhabitants of this country are in fact the lost tribe of Levi. Another group from this country promotes the "Joyous Life" ideal and is the largest religion ever founded by a woman. About twenty-five percent of this country follows the so-called “new religions,” one of which was led by a man who sold his own blood as a cure-all and orchestrated the use of umbrella-popped balloons to distribute sarin gas. This country’s dominant religion has holy sites such as the Grand Shrine of Ise and the Golden Pavilion. For 10 points, identify this home of Tenrikyo, Aum Shinrikyo, and Shinto.

answer: {amines}

DCCI and BOP-Cl are common reagents in reactions involving carboxylic acids and these compounds. A common protective group for these compounds is Cbz, or a benzyloxycarbonyl group. Because sodium cyanoborohydride is unreactive toward carbonyl groups, it can be used to form these compounds in a “reductive” reaction. Secondary ones can be formed in a variant of hydroboration that takes place between trisubstituted boranes and alkyl or aryl azides. They can be formed from carboxylic acids in Hoffman rearrangement. These compounds can catalyze Knoevenagel condensations, as can a buffer solution of these compounds and their conjugate acids. These compounds are formed from phthalamide in the Gabriel synthesis. For 10 points, name these compounds that contain an –NH2 group.

answer: the {Athenian} navy [or navy of {Athens} etc]

In one battle, this navy feigned a retreat, then had its lead ship execute a 180-degree turn and ram the opposing flagship, re-igniting the battle. Another victory for this navy earned citizenship for the slaves and foreigners who fought at the battle, but also inspired the execution of several winning commanders who failed to rescue overboard sailors. This navy’s victories at Cynossema and Cyzicus achived the goal of protecting access to the Black Sea. This navy was originally built with the profits of a silver horde from Laurium in order to fulfill a prophecy about "wooden walls" but, seventy-five years later, was thoroughly defeated by Lysander at Aegospotami. For 10 points, identify this navy, envisioned by Themistocles, which included Aeschylus when it provided the majority of ships at Salamis.

answer: {literacy}

In medieval Europe, proving that one possessed this quality was all that was needed to escape the jurisdiction of civil courts. South Carolina prohibited any slave from receiving this quality in the wake of the Stono Rebellion. In Louisiana, one proved this trait by answering SAT-style math problems; in Alabama, it had to be demonstrated by a four-page examination about the Constitution. In all states which tested for this, “grandfather clauses” exempted most whites from the test. The “benefit of clergy” was demonstrated by, for 10 points, what skill, which was tested for by discriminatory voting laws in the Jim Crow South and consists of the ability to read and write?

answer: {symmetry}

Any tensor can be turned into one having this property by summing over all permutations of its indices, and a variant of this property can be created by extending the Poincare group with the fermionic operators. As a result of this property, in the case of the non-degenerate Stark effect only the terms quadratic in the electric field contribute because the selection rule for the angular momentum quantum number causes the linear terms to vanish. If every particle has the same mass as its anti-particle, the “charge-time-parity” variety of this property is conserved in any interaction. An extension of this property assigns a fermionic partner to every boson, and a conserved current corresponds to an instance of this property according to Noether’s theorem. Hypothesized to exist in a “super” variety, for ten points, identify this property of a physical system, which refers to its invariance under some transformation, such as reflection about an axis.

A gradient in MinCD complex concentration ensures that this process begins correctly, while a fifty-five carbon alcohol is required to prevent autolysis near the end of this process. This process begins as ZipA anchors a polymerized form of FtsZ to form the Z ring. Cephalosporins and beta-lactams work by inhibiting PBPs, proteins that facilitate peptidoglycan cross-linking to form cell walls at the end of this process. Unlike a similar process in eukaryotes, it does not require a spindle, and steps prior to this process include cell elongation and replication of circular DNA. For 10 points, name this common mode of bacterial replication, in which a cell simply splits in half.

One group’s outrage at the violation of national sovereignty during this action caused them to seek revenge by torturing Graciela Sirota. That Tacuara Nationalist Movement was one of many who opposed this action, which was authorized after observing a man bringing home flowers for his 50th wedding anniversary. It occurred when a man walking to Garibaldi Street was accosted with the phrase “just a moment” and led to family members calling hospitals looking for Ricardo Clement. As a result of this action, a man was tried and sentenced to death while sitting in a glass cage, and Hannah Arendt wrote The Banality of Evil.
