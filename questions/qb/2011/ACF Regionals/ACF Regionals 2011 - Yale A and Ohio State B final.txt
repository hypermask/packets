answer: Battle of {Saratoga}

This battle is commemorated by an unnamed statue of a boot. In the early stages of this battle, sharpshooters under Daniel Morgan attacked and killed nearly all enemy officers in the advance company, before unwittingly charging into the enemy’s main force. After General Lincoln brought two thousand men, the Americans were able to force a surrender when British forces moved out to find more rations. Consisting of two major action sites, at Bemis Heights and Freeman’s Farm, the result of this battle turned the war into a global conflict, bringing French and Spanish aid to the victors. Benedict Arnold was the hero of this battle, which resulted in the surrender of General Burgoyne. For 10 points, name this battle, a victory for Horatio Gates that turned the tide of the American Revolution.

answer: {pendulum} [accept {harmonic oscillator} before “{nonlinear}”]

Holmes and Marsden used the Melnikov formalism to show that coupling perturbations in this system render it non-integrable due to the introductions of horseshoes, which are intersections between stable and unstable manifolds. The differential equation describing the dynamics of a nonlinear one of these systems contains a term proportional to the sine of the angle, which means that displacement of such a system is proportional to an elliptic integral of the first kind. A linear variant of this system avoids that complication by Taylor expanding around the equilibrium point and assuming small-angle oscillations, which gives a period of two pi times the square root of the length over the gravitational acceleration. Also exhibiting chaos when two of these are connected in a “double” variant, for ten points, identify this dynamical system, a harmonic oscillator consisting of a weight on a massless rod.

Benjamin Britten depicted a series of Roman mythological characters in a piece written for this instrument titled Six Metamorphoses after Ovid. The earliest published concerti for this instrument appear in Tomaso Albinoni’s Opus 7, while it represents the quail in the second movement of Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony. A mezzo version of this instrument represents the child in Strauss’ Sinfonia Domestica and is given the epithet “d’amore.” Mozart’s concerto for this instrument was later transposed up a key to serve as his second concerto for flute, and it plays the A that the orchestra tunes to before a performance. For 10 points, name this double reed woodwind that represents the duck in Peter and the Wolf.

answer: South {Africa}

This country set up a task force called the NTTT eight years after its 1987 White Paper on Transport Policy led to gang-like violence between cartels over sixteen-seater minibus routes. Besides those “taxi wars,” its military operations included Operation Boleas. It allied with UNITA to fight against MPLA and SWAPO in its Border War, and earlier released the Fagan Commission under the government of its only World War II Field Marshal. This nation, which disarmed all six of its nuclear warheads, was home to the “Spear of the Nation” resistance group, Jan Smuts, and police who killed sixty-nine protesters in Sharpeville. Its former leader F.W. de Klerk stood before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. For 10 points, name this country which, until 1993, imprisoned Nelson Mandela.

Alkenes can react with an iodomethyl-iodide of this element to yield cyclopropanes in the Simmons-Smith reaction. In another reaction, this element is used as a catalyst to form beta-hydroxy esters. An amalgam of this element is used with hydrochloric acid in the Clemmensen reduction. This metal is present in a protein domain with varieties including “treble clef” and “gag knuckle,” which is named for the way two cysteine and two histidine residues bind this metal, the namesake “finger” motifs.

The baritone sings the “Song to the Evening Star” before seeing a funeral procession in the third act. The title character of this opera causes outrage when he praises carnal love during a song contest against Wolfram von Eschenbach for the affection of Elisabeth. For 10 points, identify this Wagner opera about the titular minstrel’s return from Venusberg.

One force in this campaign built a series of walls called “The Circle,” forcing their opponents to include a palisade-lined ditch in the second of three counter-walls near the field of Epipolae. A force in this campaign made a winter base in the town of Catana, and the losers were massacred attempting to cross the Assinarus river. Those losers surrendered to Gylippus a year after Lamachus’s death.

answer: {glutamate} [accept {glutamic acid throughout}; do not accept “{glutamine}”]

This substance is the target of transporters coded for by the SLC1A family of genes, known as EAATs. Though not kainic acid, this endogenous chemical binds to KARs, and its buildup in extracellular space causes internal calcium 2+ buildup and cell death. Its binding to another protein channel causes EPSP depolarization and induces long-term potentiation. Its N-acetyl form regulates carbamoyl phosphate synthase and, indirectly, the urea cycle, while that aforementioned channel, antagonized by the drug PCP, is the NMDA receptor. A precursor of it precedes succinyl CoA in the Krebs cycle; that precursor is an alpha keto acid. Its replacement by valine at position 6 on the beta-globin chain causes sickle cell anemia. For 10 points, name this excitatory neurotransmitter and amino acid whose ionic form is a flavor enhancer.

A modified version of this theorem’s converse is known as Lehmer’s theorem, and a Pratt certificate uses a so-called “witness” in conjunction with Lehmer’s theorem. The strict converse of this theorem is disproven by the first set of Knödel numbers, and Euler’s totient theorem is a generalization of it. Wilson’s theorem is a corollary of it, and it follows almost directly from Lagrange’s theorem. Carmichael numbers are counterexamples to this theorem’s strict converse, meaning that they are pseudoprime for all integer bases with which they are coprime.
