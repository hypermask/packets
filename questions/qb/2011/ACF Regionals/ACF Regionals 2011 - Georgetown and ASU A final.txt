answer: {Hall} effect

In ferromagnetic materials, a version of this effect occurs in which the resultant resistivity predicted by this effect contains an additional zero-field term proportional to the magnetization. Arranging two solid-state elements which demonstrate this effect at right angles to each other and summing their output voltage to eliminate the noise is a typical way of producing a magnetic field sensor using this effect. This effect is derived by noting that the current crossed with the magnetic field creates a transverse current, which results in a potential difference. For ten points, identify this classical effect in which charge flowing across a transverse magnetic field results in an electric field component orthogonal to both the current and the magnetic field, often used to measure the sign of charge carriers.

answer: {Russia}

In the late Middle Ages, this country was home to the “cutters,” a proto-Protestant group, and the Judaizers, who preached that Christians should follow Old Testament codes. Recently, this country outlawed all evangelizing and publishing by the Jehovah’s Witnesses. The issue of whether two or three fingers should be folded while making the sign of the cross led to thousands of deaths in this country during the Raskol era, when persecution of the Old Believers took place. Its later dissenting groups included the pacifistic “spirit-wrestlers” who fled to Canada. Patriarch Nikon was one of the most influential religious leaders in this country. For 10 points, the Dukhobors come from what country, which has historically claimed to be the protector of all the world’s Orthodox Christians?

answer: Georg {Simmel}

This thinker defined the “fallacy of separateness” as failing to see the interdependency of power relations, and discussed a figure representing someone that people have common bonds with but never become close to in his book The Stranger. He claimed the intellect, which preserves subjective experience, is crucial to overcoming the stagnancy of “the blasé” in a work about urban life. This man’s most notable work relates the impersonality of modern society to the way that social standing is related to the ability to buy and sell goods using the titular commodity. For 10 points, name this German sociologist who wrote the “The Metropolis and Mental Life” and The Philosophy of Money.

answer: {bubble} sort [accept: {sinking sort} ]

The more efficient bidirectional variant of this algorithm, which reverses the direction after each pass, is referred to by the term “cocktail shaker”. Another optimization is to terminate if no swaps occur during a pass. It’s not insertion sort, but for n items it approaches a time complexity of Big O of n for mostly sorted data. However, it has a quadratic runtime in the worst case and is less efficient than insertion and selection sort in practice. This algorithm works by comparing adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. For 10 points name this sorting algorithm which is named for the way that elements move up the list.

This man created the MBR-200 movement to eliminate the puntofijismo system; that later became the Fifth Republic Movement. One joke following this man’s imprisonment for an attempted coup against Carlos Andres Perez said that he deserved 30 years in prison, one year for trying and 29 for failing. Later, he used tactics such as assigning voters to precints on the opposite side of the country to solidify power. This army paratrooper was  nicknamed “El Comandante” after winning Perez’s office in 1998 and joked about still smelling the sulfur left by a previous speaker on the podium at the United Nations, part of his years-long war of insults with George W. Bush. For 10 points name this man who obtained emergency powers after his party’s loss of legislative seats in the 2010 election in Venezuela.

answer: {ammonia}

Andrussov oxidation requires oxygen, methane, and this compound as reactants. A sulfur recovery unit is necessary for the oxidation of this compound in the Claus process. The Solvay process is only economically viable because, like carbon dioxide, this compound is recycled in it. A dilute solution of silver oxide in an aqueous solution of this substance constitutes the Tollens reagent. The synthesis of this compound can be catalyzed with finely distributed osmium, or uranium, but is most typically catalyzed with iron oxide; that reaction is an exothermic reduction of nitrogen gas with three equivalents of hydrogen. For 10 points name this base synthesized in the Haber-Bosch process, and which has chemical formula NH3.

One subtype of the most common species in this microbial genus produces a protein to stabilize tight junctions between intestinal cells. That protein, AvrA, is secreted through the Type III secretory system of that species in this genus, and dampens inflammation to allow that pathogen of this genus to avoid breaking through the epithelium until its numbers can challenge  the host immune system. That secretory system, encoded by this genus’s namesake “pathogenicity island-1,” enables species in this genus to inject virulence effectors into eukaryotic host cells. Some bacteria in this genus cause typhoid fever.
