answer: {phenolphthalein}

This substance is dissolved in alcohol, then placed on concrete, in a test to measure carbonation depth. The peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of this molecule provides the basis for the Kastle-Meyer test. It was replaced by bisacodyl in the laxative Correctol shortly before FDA reports confirmed its carcinogenicity. This molecule’s most notable property occurs due to interconversion between a lactone structure and one containing a quinoid ring. It is synthesized by reacting phenol molecules with phthalic anhydride in the presence of hot sulfuric acid. For 10 points, name this “universal indicator” that is colorless in acidic solution and pink or purple in basic solution.

answer: {Quasi}-{War} [or {Franco}-{American} War or naval war with France before the end of the question]

Thomas Truxton earned two gold medals during this war. It included the expulsion of forces occupying Dutch Curacao by Henry Geddes and the Patapsco. This war led to endless litigation over the “spoliation claims” that continued for 115 years after this war itself was settled by a treaty that began a hundred-year gap in formal American alliances. Before this conflict broke out, over three hundred merchant ships had been seized to protest Jay’s Treaty. An attempt by Pinckney, Gerry, and Marshall to end that imbroglio led to the XYZ Affair and George Washington’s recall to active duty. Hostilities in this conflict ended at the Treaty of Mortefontaine in 1800. For 10 points, identify this undeclared naval war between the U.S. and France.

answer: Bishop George {Berkeley}

This thinker used the example of how a piece of wheat is small to a man and huge to a mite, and also introduced the quote, “Westward the course of empire takes its way.” He criticized Newton’s idea of infinitesimal change in a work addressed to the “infidel mathematician” and claimed in another work that the sensation of touch helps perceive distance as much as the title concept. This author of The Analyst asserted that it’s impossible for an object to exist outside of the mind in his “master argument.” He championed immaterialism in Principles of Human Knowledge and wrote a work that claimed “esse est percipi.” For 10 points, name this Irish bishop who wrote Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous.

answer: {ATP} [or {adenosine}-5’-{triphosphate}]

Earthworms uniquely use the molecule lombricine to react with this molecule. This molecule activates P2X3 and P2X2/3, two receptors that control pain responses, and in conjunction with luciferin this molecule is responsible for the light of fireflies. In the muscular tissue of chordates, this compound donates a group to creatine. In proteins, this molecule, first synthesized by Alexander Todd, is almost always bound by a magnesium cofactor, and large quantities of this molecule are produced via oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain. For 10 points, name this molecule discovered by Karl Lohmann,, the energy currency of the cell.
