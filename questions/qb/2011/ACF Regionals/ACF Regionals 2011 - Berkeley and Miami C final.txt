answer: gravitational {two body} problem [or {Kepler} problem]

The solution to this problem yields a conserved quantity given by the cross product of linear and angular momentum minus a term proportional to the position vector. This problem is typically simplified by calculating the reduced mass, which allows one to reduce this problem to the motion of the center of mass in a central potential. The inverse-square force in this problem generates the conserved Runge-Lenz vector, and for positive energies results in an eccentricity of greater than 1 and hyperbolic trajectories; the other possible solutions include parabolic, circular, and elliptical trajectories, the latter of which are bounds states. The solution to this problem also yields such rules as the “equal areas in equal time” law. For ten points, identify this problem whose solution describes the orbit of a pair of gravitationally bound objects.

answer: {steel}

Norman Gross proposed that one form of this material has optimum conduction properties in the rolling direction due to its highly ordered crystals. A “rimmed” form of this material is characterized by a highly segregated ingot. Equilibrium forms of this material include cementite and austenite, which form lamellar structures in its pearlite microstructure. Rapid cooling of austenite can produce forms not found on its phase diagram, such as martensite. Historical methods of production resulted in the sponge, crucible, and Wootz varieties of this material. Adding tungsten prevents the degradation of this material at high temperature, while the addition of chromium to this material greatly improves its corrosion resistance.
