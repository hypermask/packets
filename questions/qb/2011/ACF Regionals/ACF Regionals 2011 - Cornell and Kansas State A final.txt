answer: {hemoglobin} [or {Hb}]

Because specific variants of this protein are often named after the geographic location in which they are discovered, its variants include Yakima and Kansas, each of which lacks a hydrogen bond that stabilizes one of its two stable quaternary states. Though the Adair and Hill equations are generally used for any enzyme, they were developed in studies of this protein. Max Perutz discovered the structure of this protein. A glutamate to valine mutation in this protein leads to its S variant, found in sickle-cell anemia. This protein has a higher affinity for carbon monoxide than its more biologically necessary substrate. For 10 points, name this protein that binds to up to four oxygen molecules and carries it through the bloodstream.

In Nepal, the Hindu ritual of "khun khane," which requires a non-lactating yak, involves doing this. The prohibition on doing this is why meat killed more than three days ago and all liver must be broiled before eating in one religion. The avoidance of this activity is also why that religion’s rules specify the use of medium-coarse salt. An alleged attempt to do this on a ritual basis was claimed as the reason for William of Norwich's abduction and for Father Thomas's death in the Damascus affair. Anti-Semites often claim that this is done while eating matzah, which makes up a certain “libel” against Jews. For 10 points, identify this taboo practice in Islam and Judaism, which in Christianity is miraculously done from the Eucharist cup.

E. R. Williams has pioneered a method to use these entities to induce gas phase dissociation for tandem mass spectroscopy. Sakuma and Hattori name a formula for determining the radiative flux of one of these objects in terms of temperature. These objects were empirically modeled by a law named for Planck, while a first-order approximation to that formula proved to be essential in the development of quantum mechanics, as the Rayleigh-Jeans law predicted an unphysical “ultraviolet catastrophe”. The heat emitted by one of these is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. For 10 points, name these objects that are perfect absorbers of radiation.
