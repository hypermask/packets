answer: Clifford {Geertz} [prompt on “{Deep Play}: {Notes} on a {Balinese Cockfight}”]

One work by this thinker discusses a ritual in which a coconut is placed in a pail of water and sinks for a period of twenty-one seconds called the “tjeng.” In that work he discussed how babies are not permitted to crawl since society fears any association with animality, while a later section titled “Playing with Fire” discusses a concept from Jeremy Bentham about an action whose stakes are so high it is irrational to engage in. This thinker borrows a term from Gilbert Ryle about the difference between a twitch and a wink in an essay about “thick description.” For 10 points, name this anthropologist who included “Deep Play: Notes on a Balinese Cockfight” in Interpretations of Culture.

answer: {Haiti} and the {Dominican Republic}

One of these two countries opposed the other by adding the cross of Constantine the Great to a national flag in a movement led by Juan Pablo Duarte called La Trinitaria. That movement held the other country responsible for ending the “Ephemeral Independence.”One of these countries’ presidents, Joaquin Balaguer, wrote a 1989 book warning that allowing the other to gain power would turn a geographical entity “on its head.” One of Balaguer’s predecessors launched Operation Perejil, which exterminated all people thought to be from the other country residing in these two country’s border zone, based on the pronunciation of the word “parsley.” For 10 points, name these two countries, one French-speaking and one Spanish-, which share the island of Hispaniola.

answer: {holy water}

A one-hundred day indulgence is acquired whenever one makes proper use of this substance, which is sometimes distributed from a device called an asperges. Gregory IX ordered that this substance be mixed with ashes and salt and used in the construction of new churches. In the Eastern Orthox Church, a “great blessing” named for this substance is said at the feast of Theophany and this substance is heated and added to the wine during the Eucharist in the ritual of zeon. This substance is always replenished on the day before Easter, when it is used to fill the baptismal font. For 10 points, identify this substance which is sprinkled on parishioners entering a Catholic Church and is created by a priestly blessing over H2O.

answer: {cyclops} [or {Cyclopes}]

When Aeneas's crew visited a location formerly inhabited by one of these creatures, they picked up the marooned sailor Achaemenides. Euripides's play Alcestis describes how Apollo was forced to serve Admetus for a year after killing these figures in retaliation for Zeus's killing of Asclepius. They supposedly built the mortarless fortifications of Mycenae and Tiryns, and their other creations include the invisibility-granting helmet of Hades. After Campe was slain, they were released from Tartarus along with their brothers the Hecatoncheires. The most famous individual one, a son of Thoosa, of them crushed Acis with a rock out of love for Galatea and was fooled by a warrior claiming that he was named “No man”.

answer: Ludwig van {Beethoven’s} piano {sonatas}

The final movement of one of these pieces ends with an arioso marked “exhausted” moving into a triumphant second fugue that Charles Rosen believes represents a physical rejuvenation. The 19th and 20th ones are often called the “easy” ones and Anton Schindler’s erroneous claim that another was inspired by a Shakespeare play led to its common title “The Tempest.” Movements called “The Absence” and “The Return” appear in one honoring the composer’s patron Archduke Randolph being forced to leave Vienna. This group of works includes ones called “Les Adieux” and “Hammerklavier” and another piece is subtitled “quasi una fantasia.” For 10 points, name this series of compositions for a specific instrument including one titled “Moonlight” created by the composer of the Eroica Symphony.

answer: Emma {Goldman}

This activist’s feminist beliefs may be traced to her treatment as a child, when this woman was forced by her father to walk back and forth across the room with a glass of water and was beaten if she spilled any. William Buwalda was court-martialed on a false charge of associating with this woman, but Buwalda was so inspired by her speeches in his defense that he joined her movement after leaving prison. She was boycotted by the British left after discussing her horror with Leninism in My Disillusionment in Russia, and her other writings include the periodical Mother Earth. She was present on-site at the Homestead Strike, where her lover Alexander Berkman tried to kill Henry Clay Frick. For 10 points, name this deported activist who was the leading voice of American anarchism.

answer: Vitamin {B12} [or {cobalamin}; accept {cyanocobalamin} or {methylcobalamin}]

This vitamin is a co-factor in the conversion of methylmalonic acid to succinyl CoA, and along with folic acid, it is required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Testing for high levels of methylmalonic acid or homocysteine is more sensitive than Schilling’s test for diagnosing deficiency of this vitamin. The “methyl” form of this vitamin is the form used in the central nervous system, and is converted in the liver from a more common form. Gastric acid blockers may also inhibit production of intrinsic factor, which is necessary for this vitamin’s absorption and is lacking in pernicious anemia. For 10 points, name this B-complex vitamin that contains a central cobalt atom.

answer: {ribosomes}

In prokaryotes, one molecule found in this organelle contains the sarcin/ricin loop, while a different domain of that molecule is the binding site for micrococcin and thiostrepton. Puromycin interferes with the major reaction that takes place in this organelle. In eukaryotes, that major reaction begins with the binding of eIF2 to this organelle, while the next step involves the binding of EF1A and EF2 to this organelle. Those steps are initiation and elongation. This organelle’s major enzyme, peptidyl transferase, causes the transfer of amino acids from tRNA anticodons to a nascent protein. For 10 points, name these organelles that serve as the site of translation.

answer: {rotation}

In Euclidean spaces of n dimensions, this operation is represented by the special orthogonal group of order n. Along with translations and boosts, operations of this kind make up the Lorentz group of special relativity. In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator is the generator of the infinitesimal operations of this kind. The plane of polarization will undergo this action in light propagating along a magnetic field, and for a rigid body, any action of this type can be decomposed into three actions of this kind performed with respect to the Euler angles. In two dimensions, performing this operation by some angle theta involves multiplying by a matrix whose four entries are cosine-theta, sine-theta, minus-sine-theta, and cosine-theta. For 10 points, identify this operation which involves displacing an object along an angular, rather than a linear coordinate.

answer: {sulfuric} acid [or H2SO4 before mentioned]

In the first step of the Marsh test for arsenic, this compound is combined with zinc in a Woulfe bottle. Basil Valentine invented two ways to produce it, including the reaction of copperas with silica, but believed the products of those reactions to be different compounds. This compound is added to cumene hydroperoxide in the first step of the industrial synthesis of phenol and acetone. The Glover tower further refined a process that uses nitrogen dioxide as a catalyst for producing this compound; that process was replaced by one that uses a vanadium(V) oxide catalyst. Those processes are the lead chamber process and contact process. This compound is the “acid” found in lead-acid batteries, such as car batteries. For 10 points, name this strong acid with formula H2SO4.

answer: {Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s court}-{packing plan} [or the {Judicial Procedures Reform Bill} of 1937]

A Clifford Berryman cartoon lampooning this proposal depicted two skyscrapers added to a Classical Revival building. One of the most energetic advocates of this program was Joseph T. Robinson, who expected to gain one of the new positions it was to create. It specifically called for a ten-year term limit and a mandatory retirement age of seventy and one half years. It was averted by a matter involving the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation and another about the West Coast Hotel, in which Owen Roberts performed the “switch in time that saved nine.” It targeted Roberts along with James McReynolds and others in the “Four Horsemen,” who had opposed New Deal policies.

answer: {methane} [or {CH4}]

Eruptions of mud volcanoes are almost always accompanied by release of this gas. Plants that live in anoxic soils have developed aerenchyma to transport this gas from the soil to the atmosphere. Terrence Aym’s ridiculous claim that the Deepwater Horizon rig would release a “twenty-mile-wide” doomsday “mega-bubble” of this gas was based on Gregory Ryskin’s hypothesis that its release from oceanic clathrate hydrates caused a mass extinction during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. In the stratosphere, this gas is broken down in a radical reaction that converts chlorine gas to gaseous hydrogen chloride, while in the troposphere, it is consumed by reacting with a hydroxyl radical. For 10 points, name this greenhouse gas, a simple hydrocarbon that is the main component in natural gas.
