answer: Battle of {Leipzig} [or Battle of the {Nations]}

This battle saw an early skirmish in which surprise fighting broke on in the streets of Wachau, but its beginning occurred as Austrian forces advanced on a Polish-held mill in Dölitz. Usually considered the successful execution of the Trachenburg Plan, this battle saw the French expulsed from a school house by Poniatowski and the Polish forces in the town of Markkleeberg. One important turning point in this battle was Murat’s disastrous use of cavalry arranged in columns at Liebertwolkwitz, followed shortly by Blücher’s routing of Marmont’s French forces at Möckern. Though Napoleon’s side was bolstered by men from the Confederation of the Rhine, the Prince of Schwarzenherg’s coalition of six nations emerged victorious. For 10 points, name this October 1813 battle that resulted in Napoleon’s abdication and exile on Elba.

answer: {charm} quark

The theoretical prediction of this particle was made in a 1970 paper by Glashow, Iliopoulos, and Maiani, who connected its proposed existence to the number of then-known lepton generations. The schematic representation of particles incorporating this particle can be seen by extending the baryon decuplet to a three-dimensional pyramid. Confirmation for the existence of this particle was provided by the discovery of the D-meson, in which this particle is found with an up or down anti-quark, and the lambda-plus baryon. The most notable experimental confirmation of this particle’s existence was known as the November Revolution, during which the finding of a bound state of this particle with its anti-particle was confirmed and eventually named the J/psi meson. For ten points, identify this quark, the fourth to be discovered and part of the same generation as the “strange” quark.

answer: {acetylcholine}

The metabolism of this molecule is affected by the glaucoma drug physostigmine. One of this molecule’s receptors is opposed by atropine, which is extracted from deadly nightshade. The poison curare blocks another receptor of this molecule; that class of receptors is attacked in the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis and is called muscarinic. Botulinum toxin inhibits the release of this compound, causing paralysis.

answer: {hydrogen peroxide} [accept {H2O2} before mentioned]

The Krutzsch process produced about a ten percent aqueous solution of this compound, but was never commercialized. This compound is produced commercially by sending bubbles of air through a solution of anthracene, leading to the autoxidation of 2-alkyl anthrahydroquinone to a 2-alkyl anthraquinone. That process is known as the AO process and was invented by Riedl and Pfleiderer. This compound is found with ferrous salts in Fenton’s reagent, and oxidizes sodium hypochlorite to give oxygen. A three percent aqueous solution of it is useful for treating minor wounds. It is broken down to oxygen and water by catalase. For 10 points, name this oxidizing agent with formula H2O2.
