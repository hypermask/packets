answer: Colonel Muammar Abu Minyar al-{Gaddafi} [or {Kaddafi}, it’s the same thing]

This man’s diplomats shot constable Yvonne Fletcher just outside his country’s embassy in London, resulting in a break in relations between his government and the U.K. This leader staged a coup when his predecessor was undergoing medical treatment in Turkey. He coined the term “Jamahiriya” to describe his government in the Green Book and his planes were involved in the Gulf of Sidra incidents. Telex messages relayed by agents of this successor of King Idris to his embassy in East Berlin resulted in his implication in the 1986 Berlin disco bombing, which led to the death of his infant daughter Hanna in ensuing airstrikes. More recently, he lambasted Switzerland for arresting his son Hannibal and welcomed back al-Megrahi, the Lockerbie bomber. A virgin bodyguard contingent protects, for 10 points, what ruler of Libya?

answer: {gluconeogenesis}

Muscle and brain cells cannot carry out this pathway because they lack an enzyme found on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum in certain other cells. One step in this pathway involves the conversion of an intermediate into fumarate, aspartate, or malate in order to transport it into the cytosol. This pathway uses enzymes in the FBPase family to make energetically favorable the reverse of a reaction that uses PFK. One reaction in this pathway requires the use of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in the GTP-dependent formation of PEP. The previous step requires the coenzyme biotin and forms oxaloacetate from pyruvate. For 10 points, name this pathway carried out in the liver, which converts non-carbohydrate compounds into new glucose.

answer: {ostracism} [prompt on {ostraka}]

Whether or not this action would be attempted during a particular year was determined via a show of hands during the sixth prytany. Primary sources for this practice often contain elaborate justifications for it, such as an elegiac couplet about a dynastic curse or an accusation of being the brother of Darius. One victim of this practice facilitated it by omitting the epithet “the Just.” The first victims of this action, which was accomplished by potshards, were men related to the tyrant Peisistratus, such as Hipparchus. The last of the thirteen known ones happened in 416 BCE. In the ten years that it was in effect, the target retained full property rights, unlike targets of political exile. For 10 points, identify this practice of expelling citizens by popular vote in the Athenian democracy.

answer: {voting} [accept word forms]

The Downsian model of this practice uses an expected-utility theorem to describe its likelihood. Riker and Ordeshook described a theory on the “calculus” of this practice, deriving an equation that added a “D” term to include its “intrinsic benefits.” Morris Fiorina described the “retrospective” type of this practice as opposed to its prospective variety, while Duncan Black created a theory explaining how targeting the “median” practitioner of this action can create a Nash equilibrium. One potential problem for the legitimacy of this practice concerns how society can have cyclical preferences despite individuals maintaining their transitive preferences as outlined in Condorcet's paradox. Various systems to aggregate this action include ranked, preferential, and plurality forms. For 10 points, identify this action that usually takes place at the ballot box.

answer: {categorical imperative}

August Rehberg critiqued this concept claiming attempts to link it with “the principle of equality” did not mean that all members of society have equal rights. Its creator distinguished it from similar “problematic” and “assertoric” ones. The opening of Mill’s Utilitarianism explains that this concept was born from consequentialist considerations and offers no help for someone faced with conflicting duties. The originator of this doctrine clarified that following it makes one a member of “the kingdom of ends.” Adherence to it ends the “failure to cultivate one’s talents” and prevents anyone from lying. Originated in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, for 10 points name this doctrine stating that actions should only be performed if they should be seen as necessary under universal law, created by Immanuel Kant.
