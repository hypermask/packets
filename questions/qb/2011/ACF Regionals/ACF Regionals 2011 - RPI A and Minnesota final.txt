answer: Ronald {Coase}

Robert Ellickson wrote a paper about this thinker “and cattle” analyzing a famous example he uses in one paper. This man claimed that in a monopoly of durable goods, the seller will still have to lower their price to sell their product. He developed a theorem that is often exemplified by considering a train whose sparks damage crops in a farm. He developed a theorem, which was later named by George Stigler, which states in the presence of externalities, the efficiency of a company is independent of whether the party who created those externalities is liable for their cost. He wrote a paper that argues the formation of the titular groups occurred to reduce transaction costs. For 10 points, name this economist who wrote “The Nature of the Firm” and “The Problem of Social Cost.”

answer: {actin}

E. coli contains a protein called MreB which is an analogue to this protein. Phalloidin is a toxin found in death cap mushrooms that interferes with this protein. Vinculin is a linkage protein that binds to this protein. Formins facilitate processive assembly of these proteins at their barbed ends and long chains that consist of this protein reach a steady state condition known as treadmilling. The F type of this protein has a distinct polarity and contains a negative end which is capped by tropomodulin and a positive end that binds to the Z disk. According to the sliding filament theory, the binding of ATP to myosin causes the myosin to release its grip on this protein which is found in the thin filament of muscles. For 10 points, name this protein found in the microfilaments of the cytoskeleton.

answer: {Helios} [or {Helius}]

According to some sources, the Graces were the children of the naiad Aegle and this god. A septet of sons of this god drove the Telkhines off of Rhodes. One son of this Greek god was the ruler of Colchis when Phrixus presented the Golden Fleece. His affair with Perse resulted in that son, Aeetes, as well as a daughter of who fell in love with a white bull sent by Poseidon. This father of Pasiphae and Circe used the island of Thrinacia to pasture his cattle, which were guarded by his daughters Lampetie and Phaethusa. This god was angered when those cattle were slaughtered and eaten by Eurylochus and the crewmen of Odysseus. Another son of this only son of the Titan Hyperion drowned after losing control of his chariot. For 10 points, name this father of Phaeton, the original Greek god of the sun.

answer: French {Consulate} [prompt on answers like {France}, {French government}, or {French Revolutionary government} before “{constitution} of the {year VIII}” is read]

In a plot against this government, a naval vessel supplied by John Wesley Wright was used along by an agent named Courson and Charles Pichegru. That plot involved replacing its leader with the Duke of Enghien. The Infernal Machine also targeted the leader of this government. This government was established by the Constitution of Year VIII, which was further amended by the Constitutions of Year X and XII. This government signed the Treaty of Luneville with Austria, which enforced the previous Treaty of Campo Formio, and it also signed the Peace of Amiens with the United Kingdom. Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyes helped establish this government, which rose to power after the fall of its predecessor in the coup of 18 Brumaire.

answer: {boundary layer}

One way of estimating the size of one of these structures is by integrating the momentum thickness across the exit plane, a formalism appropriately known as the momentum-integral technique. In the case of an adverse pressure gradient, but not in the case of a favorable pressure gradient, momentum loss results in the decoupling of this structure from the immersed body beyond the separation point. For laminar flow past a plate, the velocity profile is a function of a single dimensionless variable, which allows the thickness of this structure to be given by five over the square root of the Reynolds number according to the Blasius formula. The outer edge of this region is often defined as the point where the flow velocity is equal to 99% of the free stream flow velocity. For 10 points, name this structure that represents the region of a flow where viscous diffusion is important and which are divided into laminar and turbulent types.

answer: {black Mormons} [accept {African}-{Americans} or similar {terms even though} the {doctrines} are not {restricted} to {black Americans}; accept all reasonable and {polite} synonyms for “{black people}”]

The most notable change of doctrine about these people came about after the author of The Miracle of Forgiveness spent a day alone in the “Upper Room.” These people’s particular needs are addressed through a fraternal organization known as the Genesis Group. Offshoot movements such as the Strangites and Bickertonites often elevated these people to positions of leadership to differentiate themselves. In 1966, Bruce McConkie wrote that these people were "less valiant in the pre-existence." One of these people, Enoch Lewis, inspired a change in doctrine about them when he married Matilda Webster. They were the subject of Spencer Kimball’s “Official Declaration--2”, and according to a now-abandoned doctrine, they were created when Ham married Egyptus, who was a descendant of Cain. For 10 points, identify this group within Mormonism who, as of 1978, may become priests, and who were never specifically forbidden from miscegenation.

answer: {Caligula} [or Gaius Caesar {Germanicus}; prompt on partial answer]

This emperor began the custom of donatavum, a cash bonus to soldiers which became increasingly cumbersome later on. The only primary source on this man is a work by Philo Judaeus that recounts an embassy of Jerusalemites which tried to persuade him to intervene in a religious dispute with pagans. This leader was told that he had as much chance of becoming emperor as he did of crossing the bay and keeping his feet dry, so he created a floating causeway of boats. When audience members booed him for a poor gladiator show, this emperor had their tongues cut out and then fed them to the lions. This emperor once threw a party for Incitatus, presenting him with paintings to hang in his marble bedroom. He also appointed Incitatus, a horse, to the Senate. for 10 points, name this son of Agrippina the Elder who preceded Claudius as Roman emperor.

answer: {infrared} spectroscopy [or {IR} spectroscopy]

In one variation of this technique, a beam is directed toward a dense crystal in contact with the analyte, producing an evanescent wave that is absorbed by the analyte. That variant of this process does not require any sample prep and is known as attenuated total reflectance. A molecule can be analyzed using this technique if changes to the direction or magnitude of its bond length causes a change in its dipole moment. Preparing a sample for this process often involves an oil called Nujol or creating a pellet out of potassium bromide, and part of the spectrum produced by this process is called the fingerprint region. This technique analyzes movements known as rocking, wagging, or scissoring and typically involves light from 4000-400 inverse centimeters. For 10 points, name this form of spectroscopy which as its name suggests involves light with a slightly longer wavelength than visible light.
