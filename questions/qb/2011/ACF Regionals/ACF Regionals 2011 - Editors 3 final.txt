answer: {CAM} photosynthesis [or Crassulacean {acid metabolism} photosynthesis; prompt on {photosynthesis} by itself; do not accept or prompt on “{C3}” or “{C4}”]

Ontogeny of this pathway is often studied using species of genus Peperomia, while another common model organism for studying it, Mesenbryanthemum crystallinum, switches to it in response to increased salinity. PCAT-1 is a promoter for the Ppc1 gene transcribed to produce a unique isoform of PEP carboxylase used in this pathway. Unlike a similar pathway, this pathway performs both the fixation and decarboxylation steps in the mesophyll cells, and during it, isocitric and malic acid are shuttled to the vacuole for storage. For 10 points, name this alternative to the C3 and C4 pathways that temporally separates the steps of photosynthesis and is used in plants such as cacti and pineapples.

answer: {Zealots}

This group took as their role model the Biblical Phinehas, who killed Zimri with a spear, and counted among the chief crimes the theft of a certain cup. They first rose up against a census, and forty of them were later burned to death for responding to a call to destroy a statue of an eagle. Those who informed and collaborated against this group were killed by their dagger-men, the Sicarii. Some members of this group held off the Tenth Fretensis legion for three years during an attack by Flavius Silva, though Eleazar ben Jair ultimately decided that they should kill themselves rather than surrender. For 10 points, the defenders of Masada were part of what political group in ancient Judea that worked against Roman rule with great passion?

One common reagent used to do this action is produced by reacting isocyanate groups with ethylenimine. Plasma-based methods for doing this, such as one that uses oxygen plasma, are being explored as alternatives to the Hercosett process, which produces chloramines waste products. One early method of doing this used divinyl sulfone to achieve cross-linking of cellulose fibers. The end products of another process are called Sanforized. This action is often done to counteract felting, or the unwanted entanglement of fibers.

Soldiers defending this program roughed up the Canadian David McTaggart, who was protesting it. Material used in this program was manufactured as part of a secret agreement with Israel to assist in building the Dimona facility. This program's products were first used in the Blue Jerboa test and were demonstrated underground in Agatha. Improper setup at another test of this program’s output led to a cabinet minister getting a fatal dose of radiation in the Beryl incident. Fernando Pereira was killed in another strike against this program’s opponents, which occurred in 1985 in Auckland harbor and resulted in the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior.

answer: the {Benedictine rule} [or {Rule} of St. {Benedict}, etc]

In 1938, a controvery emerged over whether this system was plagiarized from the earlier Regula mastri, with even its defenders admitting that this code took much from the writings of John Cassian. This code suggests that the guest master and the cellarer be appointed unilaterally and bars all private property without exception. Though its author was the target of a poisoning by a disgruntled subject of this code, it in fact relaxed earlier extremes by proscribing eight hours of sleep, no additional fast times, and climate-appropriate clothing. It was written by a man who was the twin brother of St. Scholastica and imposed it on Monte Cassino. For 10 points, identify this code for monastic behavior in the Catholic Church, composed by the patron saint of Europe, an abbot from Nursia.

answer: {luminosity} [prompt on {absolute magnitude}; do not accept luminance]

A function named after this quantity was modeled as a power law with an exponential cut-off by Paul Schechter. Ernst Opik calculated the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy by assuming that the ratio between its mass and this quantity was constant. It is a power function of rotation rate, according to the Tully-Fisher relation. The value of this quantity for which a star’s gravitational pressure equals its radiation pressure is known as the Eddington limit. Standard candles have a known value for this quantity, which equals the total amount of energy produced in one second. It is plotted against temperature in a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. For 10 points, name this measure of brightness from which one can compute a star’s apparent magnitude, and which can be measured in lux or lumens.

One test of this concept saw participants assert that a stone was rolling because it was afraid of the grass and leaves blow because they like to dance. Barbel Inholder asked subjects to identify a doll’s viewpoint while looking at 3D display of a mountain during this phase, while another test in which equal amounts of water are poured into identical beakers before being poured into different shaped glasses illustrates subjects do not understand the principle of conservation at this stage. Animism and egocentrism are characteristics of this stage, which is divided into the sub-phases of symbolic function and intuitive thought.

answer: {meta-stable} [accept word forms]

The quantum Zeno effect occurs when a quantum system in this type of state is measured frequently, causing it to remain in that state. This type of state is the operating basis for the bubble chamber, since the superheated liquid hydrogen used in those devices represents one realization of this kind of state. Techniques such as optical pumping are used to create population inversions in which electrons are placed into these types of states, from which they undergo a lasing cascade. This term characterizes the output of an element such as a flip-flop before it has settled following a transition, and a mechanical example of this type of state is a ball sitting on top of a hill which will roll down the hill if disturbed. For ten points, identify this type of state in which a system is in equilibrium but may easily transition to a lower energy state under any perturbation.
