answer: {degenerate} matter [accept {neutron}-{degenerate matter}, {electron}-{degenerate matter}, {degenerate helium}, {degenerate carbon}, {degenerate oxygen} and other {more specific} answers {containing degenerate throughout}]

Low-mass AGB stars temporarily contain this kind of matter after their helium has been entirely consumed; this matter is then eliminated by a carbon or oxygen flash while in low-mass stars, a similar process called a helium flash signals the beginning of helium burning and the elimination of this kind of matter. Pressure in this kind of matter is independent of temperature, but increases non-linearly as the four-thirds or five-thirds power of the density. That namesake pressure arises from the need to elevate fermions into higher energy states due to the impossibility of multiple fermions occupying the same quantum state. For 10 points, identify this kind of matter found in strange stars, white dwarfs, and neutron stars, supported against gravitational collapse not by thermal energy, but rather by the Pauli exclusion principle.

answer: {Dan White}

This man was described as “in pretty bad condition” by Douglas Schmidt, who defended him during an event he inspired on May 21. That event, named for this man, was fuelled by a Cleve Jones speech and led to a police raid on the Elephant Walk bar that ended with an order from Chief Chales Gain. During the reaction he inspired, Carol Ruth Silver was injured by a thrown object but tried to calm the situation, as did acting mayor Dianne Feinstein. Approximately sixty police officers were injured during the riots that followed his acquittal, which included one protester declaring “make sure you put in the paper that I ate too many twinkies.” For 10 points, name this former city supervisor who killed George Moscone and Harvey Milk, then launched a widely derided defense.

answer: Charles Sanders {Peirce}

This thinker used an elliptic pattern to map a sphere as a square to create his “quincuncial map.” This philosopher wrote a work that examines whether a diamond in a cushion of cotton can be called hard. He outlined the index, the icon, and the symbol as three classifications to his theory of the triadic relationship between the interpretant, the sign, and the object. He juxtaposed the “Gospel of Greed” and the “Gospel of Belief” in his article “Evolutionary Love” and wrote a work that dismisses the “method of authority” and the “method of tenacity” in favor of the scientific method in an article in Popular Science Monthly. For 10 points name this author of “The Fixation of Belief” and “How to Make Our Ideas Clear”, one of the founders of Pragmatism.

answer: {Diels}-{Alder} reaction

This reaction occurs twice, once intramolecularly, in the synthesis of gibberelic acid. Breslow showed an acceleration of this reaction in aqueous solution that is attributed to hydrophobic effects. Like aldol reactions, it can be enantioselectively catalyzed by both magnesium and copper(II) chelates of bis-oxazolines. Other popular catalysts include scandium triflate and ytterbium triflate, the latter of which is commonly used with a compound named after Danishefsky in this reaction’s aza- variant. One of this reaction’s namesakes also names a rule that states that endo addition is preferred in this reaction. For 10 points, name this doubly-eponymous pericyclic addition reaction in which a conjugated diene is added to a dienophile.

One of the chief architects of this action quickly fell out of favor and wound up under the protection of the Duke of Weimar, where he wrote a book about Freemason and Illuminati influence on his home country Joseph Martin-Dauch from Castelnaudary notably abstained from this action, and is seen crossing his arms at the side of a depiction of it. It was led by Jean Mounier, who declared that a newly created body existed “wherever its members are assembled.” Its participants pledged “not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the kingdom is established” one month before the storming of the Bastille. For 10 points, name this June 20, 1789 event which, due to locked doors at the National Assembly’s meeting hall at Versailles, took place at a sporting venue.

The ruler of this place attempted to prevent the theft of the artifacts of a previous generation of deities by digging a pit to stop the fleeing thief, upon whom a flock of vicious quails was set. In order to reach this location, one must spend four years overcoming nine trials; these include enduring a wind that cuts like a knife and crossing a river on the back of a dog. Humankind was created from a bag of shattered bones retrieved from this location by the god of the morning star and his brother. Fallen warriors and women who die in childbirth are among the few who travel to the east and west, rather than northwards to this location, while drowning victims instead go to a paradise ruled by the rain god Tlaloc.

answer: {geomagnetic reversals} [or {reversals} of {Earth’s magnetic} field; or reasonable equivalents]

This event did not occur at all during a 40-million-year period during the Cretaceous, known as the Cretaceous Superchron. A similar phenomenon occurs in the sun with greater periodicity than on Earth, and is largely responsible for the sunspot cycle. If one of these events were to occur today, modern society could be destroyed by the effect of CMEs on electronics. These events are believed to be the result of irregularities in iron convection in the outer core. A test proposed by Vine, Matthews, and Morley based on the existence of this phenomenon provides the most convincing evidence for Hess’s hypothesis of seafloor spreading, since a certain property that changes each time one of these events occurs is crystallized in seafloor igneous rocks at the time of their solidification. The most recent of these events occurred 780,000 years ago, and was named for Brunhes and Matsuyama. For 10 points, identify these events wherein the polarity of a certain global field interchanges North and South over the course of thousands of years.

This man’s first day in Parliament was overshadowed by the clandestine appeaarance of the outlawed Louis Riel, who signed the MP’s register and slunk away before being noticed. He was attacked for insisting upon the “tin pot” navy and lost political support to Henri Bourassa for being knighted and attending Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee. In a wartime election, he lost to the Union Party of Robert Borden.

answer: {bone marrow} [accept {red marrow} or {yellow marrow}]

X GM-CSF stimulates stem cells in this tissue to differentiate into four types of cells, three of which contain azurophils. One symptom of CAMT is the congenital absence of one type of cells normally present in this tissue; when present, those cells produce TPO. Those polyploid cells extrude cytoplasmic extensions through sinusoids in this tissue to produce objects that in turn produce vWF. This primary lymphoid organ is often housed in a medullary cavity and surrounded by endosteum. While T cells in this tissue are the cause of GVHD, B cells become immunocompetent here. One type of cancer that originates in this tissue is Kahler’s disease, while another is leukemia. For 10 points, identify this sometimes-hematopoietic tissue which comes in red and yellow varieties, found in the interior of most bones.
