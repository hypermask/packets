At one point in this novel, its protagonist is presented with the exact tuned whistled by George Washington during his crossing of the Delaware. Shortly thereafter, its protagonist places the word “but” in a cannon that is then used to destroy the castle of the Soundkeeper, a task he undertook at the behest of Dischord and Dynne. The central figures of this book barely escape the Terrible Trivium, watch Chroma conduct the sunset, and encounter Canby on the Island of Conclusions, a place they accidentally visit on their way to Digitopolis. Its protagonist is accompanied by the Humbug and Tock the watchdog in his quest to reconcile King Azaz and the Mathemagician and rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason.

Many of these people were killed in the 1930s in the Caledon Bay crisis, and they later participated in the Pilbara strike.

answer: {aldehydes}

One of these organic compounds is converted to an alkene by a diorganochromium compound in the Takai olefination. Compounds may be reduced to this functionality via the use of DIBAL-H (die-bahl aitch), and alkynes are formed by a reaction of these compounds with tetrabromomethane and triphenylphosphine named for Corey and Fuchs. When these organic compounds lack a hydrogen atom in the alpha position, their disproportionation can be induced by a base in the Cannizzaro reaction. These organic compounds are oxidized to carboxylic acids by a diamminesilver (I) complex, leading to the precipitation of metal onto the inside of the vessel, giving the positive “silver mirror” result of the Tollens test. For 10 points, name this special class of ketones with one R group being just hydrogen.

An Emlen funnel is used to study these events, the “reverse” form of which can affect individuals for whom this phenomenon is genetic, like passerines. Irregular types of these events are called irruptions. Major types of this phenomenon include the “chain” form, wherein populations slide north or south, and the “leap-frog” form, wherein summer and winter latitudes swap outright.

answer: {antiferromagnetic} materials [accept word forms]

For a uniaxial crystal with this property, Kittel showed that when the wave number of collective excitations goes to zero, the energy converges to a finite number proportional to the square root of the anisotropy constant; thus, these materials exhibit a namesake resonance frequency. The frequency of spin waves in materials with this property is linearly proportional to wave number and such spin waves exhibit two independent polarization directions. In materials with this property the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature has a well-defined maximum, at which point that graph has a kink. This property arises when the sum of the mean magnetic moment densities in a sub-lattice is zero, but the difference is non-zero. For ten points, identify these materials in which the magnetic moments in a unit cell cancel each other out, and which become paramagnetic above the Neel point.

At one point, this address invokes the idea of “soul force” and uses an extended metaphor of a defaulted promissory note and a “check which has come back marked insufficient funds,” but argues that “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” This text quotes from the Biblical books of Psalms, Amos, and Isaiah in order, and memorably inverts a line from Richard III by citing “the sweltering summer of discontent.” This speech opens by noting that it has been five score years since Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, and concludes with “Free at last!
