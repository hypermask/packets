answer: {RNA interference} [or {RNAi}; or {post}-{transcriptional} gene silencing]

Schwarz, Tomari, and Zamori demonstrated that the primary enzyme in the final stage of this process was not Tudor-SN and suggested that magnesium was a cofactor.

answer: {NMR spectroscopy} [or {nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy} ]

This technique can be used in tandem with a type of Overhauser effect analysis to distinguish between molecular conformations. Materials whose conduction electrons acquire ordered spins during this technique exhibit the Knight shift.

answer: {cooling} [accept equivalents like {lowering} of {temperature} and {refrigeration}]

One method of carrying out this action was developed by London, Clark, and Mendoza and relies on the fact that a mixture of helium-3 and helium-4 undergoes phase separation. Because the magnetic field times the differential mangetization contributes a term to the thermodynamic relation, it is possible to carry out this process by reducing the magnetic field at constant entropy. A non-ideal gas for which the slope of the inversion curve is negative will undergo this process if constricted at constant enthalpy, a phenomenon known as the Joule-Thomson effect. On atomic scales, this process can be carried out with laser trapping, as demonstrated by Steven Chu. For ten points, identify this process which can also be achieved by running a Carnot heat engine in reverse, the lowering of a substance’s temperature.
