When this compound is added to proteins with aromatic rings, they turn yellow; that test makes use of the xanthoproteic reaction. This compound reacts with cotton to form a smokeless powder once used in movie film. One extremely energy intensive method for producing this compound with a plasma arc was named for Birkeland and Eyde, though that method has since been replaced by process that makes uses of a platinum-(*)-rhodium catalyst.

answer: {RNAi} or {RNA interference}

Morpholinos, synthetic uncharged nucleic acids, can be used to initiate this process, and RDE-4 and R2D2 are two proteins that form complexes with an endoribonuclease central to this process. This process is often initiated using delivery by feeding in which E. Coli with the desired payload are simply consumed by the target organism.
