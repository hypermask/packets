After this engagement, TIME speculated that Herbert Leary had actually been in command due to its location, while Milton Ricketts earned a medal of honor here for turning on a fire hose before expiring from shrapnel. Near mastery of the Ro code aided the winning side, while the losing commander was forced to take a position at a war college after his side was forced into the Kokoda Track campaign. Shigeyoshi (*) Inoue was unable to launch a naval invasion against Port Moresby in the wake of this battle, which saw the Shoho sunk and kept the light carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku from another clash a month later. Despite heavy damage, Frank Fletcher's Yorktown survived this battle and played a crucial role in the ensuing Battle of Midway. Seeing the sinking of the Lexington, for 10 points, name this May, 1942 battle, the first major carrier engagement, fought in a namesake body of water off Australia.

answer: {Lagrangian} [prompt on "{L}" before mentioned]

In QCD, the density of this function is locally invariant under the BRST transformation and includes a Faddeev-Popov ghost term. With no matter present, this for gravity is equal to the negative one over 16 pi Big G times the sum of the Ricci tensor and two times the cosmological constant times the the square root of the negative determinant of the metric tensor. That formulation and its integral is named for Einstein and Hilbert. The partial derivative of this function divided by the partial derivative of the generalized velocity is equal to the generalized (*) momentum, while its namesake's equation relates its partial derivative to to the derivatives of the generalized momentum and position. The integral of this function over time is the action. For 10 points, name this function which is the kinetic energy minus the potential energy, unlike the Hamiltonian, and is symbolized L.

answer: {Philosophical Investigations}

One section of this book imagines a man who writes “S” in his diary whenever he experiences a certain sensation, while another section posits a boy who writes “1004” after being told to “add 2” to 1000.

answer: ANSWER: Battle of {Cannae}

A military treatise on this battle discusses its implications for Napoleon and Frederick the Great before closing with an account of Sedan. The victorious general forced the action by ordering his light cavalry to harass troops carrying drinking water from the Aufidus River, while it turned on the losers' decision to increase line depth to 36 men. Eight legions – the most then assembled – took part in this clash, an obsession of von Schlieffen, which led to the (*) principes being deployed farther behind the hastati and the permanent adoption of the strategy of Fabius Cunctator. Maharbal's Numidian cavalry enabled the victorious side to place Celts and Spaniards at their center, which led to Roman forces under Amelius Paulus and Terentius Varro suffering over 90% casualties after being doubly-enveloped.

answer: {congestion} [accept {traffic congestion}]

The control of this occurrence is based on an optimization model developed by Frank Kelly. The RED algorithm is used to deal with this and one way to indicate the occurrence of this is with ECN bits. Nagle's algorithm attempts to prevent this from causing collapse due to overhead. In most stacks, upon a timeout, the window for this is set to one MSS. To deal with this in most TCP implementations, a slow start phase is used followed by a phase for the avoidance of this.
