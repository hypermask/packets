Calcium carbonate, iron-three acetate, and this compound are used to decarboxylate the intermediate in the second step of the Ruff degradation. The industrial synthesis of this compound is accomplished via repeated oxidation and hydrogenation of alkyl anthroquinones in the AO process. Biosensors for this compound typically utilize nanoparticles coupled to an enzyme isolated from horseradish called HRP.

The Konishi anomaly occurs in gauge theories incorporating this, and renormalizable couplings in theories incorporating it do not violate R-parity. Adding this theory to quantum mechanics allows analyzing systems using partner Hamiltonians, which have corresponding eigenstates. Adding it in a namesake minimal extension of the (*) standard model creates the phenomenon of gauge coupling unification, in which makes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces approximately equal at high energies, solving the hierarchy problem.
