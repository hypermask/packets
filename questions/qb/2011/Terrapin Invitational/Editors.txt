answer: The {British Raj} or {British India} [prompt on partial answer; accept anything {establishing} that {British people} are in {control} of {India}]

This government briefly and disastrously put its army quartermasters in charge of all transportation logistics, leading to a horrifying incident in which 61 prisoners suffocated when troops lost track of them after locking them in a freight transport. An early test for this government was the Orissa famine, while an early death knell for this state was the failure of the Cripps mission. This state responded to the tepid reception of its (*) Montagu-Chelmsford reforms by cracking down through the Rowlatt Acts, and was plagued by the long-running Moplah unrest. Reginald Dyer, a commander for this state, went absolutely insane and turned his car-mounted machine guns on a crowd of festival-goers in a 1919 massacre, while a caravan of protesters arrived at Dandi and began making salt to protest this government's taxes. The perpetrators of the Amritsar massacre, for 10 points, name this state protested by Mahatma Gandhi, a colonial administration directed by the Crown to oversee cities like Delhi and Bombay.

One tissue of this type is useful in differentiating the ileum from the duodenum and jejunum, while the namesake virus of another example of this tissue shares a protein receptor with the hilariously-named coxsackievirus and had its serotype 36 linked to chicken obesity. Mucosa-associated Peyer's Patches and Waldeyer's ring are composed of this tissue, where Castleman's disease originates. Winterbottom's Sign in this kind of tissue indicates Sleeping Sickness, while other anomalies can suggest toxoplasmosis. The most notable (*) clusters of this tissue exhibit B-cell proliferation in their Germinal Centers after antigen presentation, and structures composed of it are the usual origination point for cancers like Hodgkin's disease. Adenoids, or tonsils, are a form of, for 10 points, what bodily tissue whose name derives from its role as a reservoir to mature white blood cells and whose “nodes” in the head and neck may swell during infections.

answer: The {Delta Force}

Its central action was preceded five years earlier by the botched Operation Eagle Claw, instigated by the hijacking of American Travelway Flight 282 from Athens to New York. New World Revolutionary Organization leader Abdul Rifa, who emerged as its central villain, used the covert backing of Iran to first divert the plane to Algiers prior to an abortive raid; that action was followed by a landing in Beirut, where U.S. forces under the command of Colonel Nick Alexander suffered their lone casualty in the course of a successful rescue operation that saw Major Scott McCoy resolve the crisis using (*) rockets fired from his motorcycle.

Dahlquist studied the stability of this process and names a barrier for which linear multistep methods such as Adams Moulton can be used to perform this process when the input is stiff. Cauchy's kernal is used in the variation of parameters method that was developed by Lagrange, while numerical methods for this process include ones named for (*) Runge-Kutta and Euler. This process can be done analytically using Picard Iteration or separation of variables. This can be done to first order linear equations using an integrating factor, and general linear equations result in a homogenous term with variable coefficients and an inhomogenous term. For 10 points, name the process which usually involves finding a function that satisfies an equation involving derivatives.

Prior to issuing his namesake doctrine as Secretary of State in response to Japan's invasion of Manchuria, Henry Stimson held this post, as did a man who became uncompromisingly genocidal and personally led the butchery of the (*) Moro Crater Rebellion.

A pivotal period in this city's history was prefaced by the abolishment of the Council of 60, which was caught between the Council of 200 and the “Little Council.” Henry II's Edict of Chateaubriand severely restricted this city's commercial efforts while simultaneously flooding it with impoverished immigrants. A series of moderately tense standoffs over playing cards dominated this city's politics under an administration backed by the Berthelier family, who had helped throw out the House of (*) Savoy. William Farrell facilitated the rise of one of this city's most notable leaders, who responded to the presence of the author of Two Books of Dialogues on the Trinity, Michael Servetus, by lighting him on fire for having dared to annotate copies of The Institutes of the Christian Religion.

These constructs can be omitted in Density Functional Theories in a uniqueness result named for Hohenberg and Kohn. Woodward and Hoffman used these constructs to predict stereo- and regio-selectivity of pericyclic reactions. Koopmans' theorem relates the energy of these constructs to ionization energy. In Hartree-Fock theory these are the (*) eigenfunctions of the Fock operator, and are linear combination of Gaussian functions. They can also be calculated by Self-Consistent Field theories. They can be used to calculate bond order, and these predict the paramagnetism of gaseous oxygen and the stability of radicals like nitric oxide.

One character in this opera complains about his charges in “Moi, je suis Aristée,” which contains optional falsetto notes, and later offers the solemn reflection “La mort m'apparaît souriante.” That man's servant constantly bitches about no longer being king of the Boetians after the central female character discovers that her sheep-tending lover (*) Aristee is actually the master of John Styx. This opera's title character disrupts a feast of the gods at the goading of Public Opinion despite the fact that both he and his wife absolutely hate each other.

Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich extended his critiques of the educational system to this discipline in a text describing it as a “nemesis,” while Hans Georg Gadamer argued that the postmodern form of this discipline has led to the “enigma” of an associated quality. Guiding principles for Bimaristans can be found in a major treatment of this discipline, which saw Avicenna abandon the deductive reasoning of his metaphysical works and is often known as his (*) “Canon.” Erasistratus postulated pneuma as the driving force in his theory of it, while the death of Eudemus and an event named after the Antoninus family were described in treatises on this discipline by its leading Roman proponent. Cnidus and Kos were home to the two major Greek schools concerned with this discipline.
