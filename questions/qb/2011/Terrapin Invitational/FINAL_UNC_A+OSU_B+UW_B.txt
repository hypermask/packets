The active site of the cytotoxic drug Calicheamicin is made from two of this functional group.  One method for synthesizing these compounds uses potassium tert-butoxide and is also used to form 1,3-dipolar addition products and cyclopropanes and can produce higher yields with the Bestmann modification.  Another way to synthesize these is not the Wittig reaction but does form an ylide using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide from an inputted aldehyde.  Those synthesis reactions are the Seyferth-Gilbert and (*) Cory-Fuchs reaction.  Treating a palladium catalyst with quinoline and lead acetate produces Lindlar’s catalyst, which is useful in partially reducing these compounds.  For 10 points, name this functional group consisting of a hydrocarbon with a triple bond between the carbon atoms.
