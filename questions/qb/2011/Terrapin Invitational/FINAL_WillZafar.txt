answer: {phase} transitions [prompt on {changes} of {state} before mentioned]

These phenomena may be divided into universality classes based on how their correlation lengths diverge as a certain variable approaches a critical value. Another classification of these phenomena developed by Paul Ehrenfest is based on discontinuities in the derivative of the free energy, and their (*) second-order variety are described phenomenologically by Lev Landau by order parameters. One occurs at the Neel point, the antiferromagnetic analogue of the Curie temperature. The Clausius-Clapeyron relation characterizes them in a gas-liquid system. FTP, name these thermodynamic transitions, examples of which include deposition, sublimation, condensation, freezing, and other changes of state.
