answer: {Weimar} Republic

A “Council of People's Commissioners” was established prior to the rise of this state, while one of its leaders founded the DVP and deliberately attempted to destabilize the economy of an eastern neighbor. Foreign action triggered this polity's extremist “Liberty Law,” while secondary leaders in its history include Hugo Haase of the USPD. Karl Liebknecht and (*) Rosa Luxemburg were killed in the first year of this polity's existence in the Spartacist uprising. The Treaty of Rapallo was signed during this state's “year of crises,” which also saw the occupation of the Ruhr Valley by France after this polity defaulted on backbreaking financial burdens.

In one story, this god kills the goddess of food, Ogetsuhime, which introduced silk worms and the five staple grains of Japan into the world. A figure entitled the Foot-Stroking Elder was his steward at this god's palace in Izumo. In another tale, this god made many attempts on Okuninushi's life after he fell in love with this god's daughter, Suseri-hime. When this god was born, his incessant crying and shrieking for his mother, (*) Izanami, caused his banishment to the underworld. While departing, he challenged his sister to a competition wherein he created five gods from Amaterasu's necklace and then threw a flayed horse at her. FTP, name this Japanese god of storms and wielder of Grasscutter who was created from Izanagi's nose and was brother to Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi.

answer: {Zeeman} Effect

In a strong field, the magnitude of this effect is determined by m l and m s instead of a coupled quantity m j. The anomalous version of this phenomenon can be explained by noting that the magnitude of this effect is proportional to the Bohr Magniton and (*) Lande-g factor, which accounts for both L and S, and led to the discovery of electron spin. A form of this effect occurs in spin-orbit coupling in atomic fine structure. This phenomenon sees a perturbation Hamiltonian break the degeneracy of atomic states with different angular momentum. For 10 points, name this effect where an applied magnetic field causes the splitting of spectral lines, the magnetic analogue of the Stark effect.

answer: {epoxide} [accept {oxirane}]

Nakanishi hypothesized that a cascade reaction of these functional groups might generated certain ladder compounds found in red tides. The Payne rearrangement leads to the isomerization of this functional group. The reaction of trimethylsulfonium iodide, base, and a ketone yields this functional group in one reaction, though that reaction can also create the similar aziridine group when a nitrogen containing compound is used. A more canonical synthesis makes use a concerted intermediate step resembling a (*) butterfly and uses an olefin and peracid as reactants--that synthesis is sometimes named for Prilezhaev. This functional group can be "opened" by nucleophiles to relieve ring strain and yields an alcohol. FTP, name this functional group similar to a cyclic ether which consists of a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom.

In a desert in this game, you are able to find two differently colored sesame seeds that talk and ask you to reunite them, even though it is not possible to do so. One enemy in this game is described as “borange” and is found in a factory behind a waterfall that you must stand in front of for three minutes. In that factory you have to use a jar of fly honey on (*) Master Belch in order to defeat him.

answer: {Anglo}-{Zulu} War

At one engagement during this conflict, groups of defenders repeatedly had to escape into adjoining rooms by hacking through walls with a pick-axe and greatly benefited from the attacker's inability to fire accurately from a position known either as "the Eyebrow" or the Oscarberg. Bromhead and John Chard commanded the victors at that battle, which saw a hospital at a river ford defended from behind stacked mealie bags and (*) biscuit boxes. This war coincided with the final year of the Midlothian campaign, which vaulted Gladstone to power, and saw Garnet Wolseley replace Lord Chelmsford, who forced the eventual winners to make a heroic stand at Rorke's Drift against the reserves, or "loins," of the losing side; that side employed the assegai and the "Buffalo Horns" formation at battles like Ulundi and Isandhlwana, but Cetshwayo was unable to force terms with the British. Seeing an end to the dynasty begun by Shaka, for 10 points, name this 1879 conflict between Britain and the namesake Southern African tribe.

Edward MacDowell's first piano sonata is described by this adjective, which titles the fifth movement sonata of Nicolai Medtner’s Forgotten Melodies. “From Hannover Square north,” the third movement of Charles Ives’ Second Orchestral Set, takes place at the end of this sort of day, and the third movement of Poulenc’s violin sonata is marked this kind of presto.

In Veronese's depiction of these two figures, a putti wrangles a horse at right while one of them inexplicably milks herself as they are “united by love.” A gilded, white building with four rows of columns is visible in the background of another work depicting these figures, which sees the Graces amuse themselves with their possessions at right.

Its action was observed in an experiment in which a fluorescent filament of actin was attached to its gamma subunit and turned counterclockwise in the presence of a certain molecule. The F0 complex of this protein forms a channel through the membrane, whereas the F1 complex stretches into the matrix. The binding of a proton to one of the c-subunits in the (*) F0 produces a 1/10 turn in the gamma subunit of this protein, in turn driving a conformational change in the alpha-beta subunit which allows for the binding of the namesake molecule. FTP, name this enzyme present in the mitochondrion, which creates a highly energetic molecule via phosphorylation.
