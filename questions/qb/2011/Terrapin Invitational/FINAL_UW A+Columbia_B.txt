answer: {Devonian}

This era saw the emergence of species such as Cladoselache, Prototaxite, and the Placoderm Dunkleosteus , which at up to three meters in length was one of the largest organisms in existence at the time. A notable Lagerstatten for this period is the Rhynie Chert in Scotland, discovered in 1912 by Dr. William Mackie. During this period the continents of Laurentia and Baltica collided, and the supercontinent Gondwanaland migrated north. Global cooling at the (*) Frasnian-Famennian boundary late in this period led to the extinction of seventy percent of marine vertebrates, particularly reef builders, which would not fully recover until the Mesozoic. For 10 points, name this geologic time period preceding the Carboniferous, and which was named for a county in southwestern England.

answer: {White Lotus Rebellion} [or Whatever the Christ that is in Chinese]

According to a so-called “Draft History” written 120 years later, the victors in this conflict locked whole populations in makeshift pens to reduce the recruiting effectiveness of roving bands led by female warriors. A half-century after this conflict, its remnants may have coalesced into the Nien revolt, and it was fomented by the brutality of a “clique” that included Fu Kang-an. The largest disturbance since the Revolt of the (*) Three Feudatories, this conflict persisted thanks to the staggering greed and stupidity of Heshen, who was finally dismissed after the Jiaqing Emperor replaced the Qianlong Emperor.

C8 and C18 are commonly used in a variety of the process with reversed phase, while dynamic light scattering can be combined with absolute size-exclusion to determine the size of molecules in this process. Using a pump in place of gravity and gradient elution are two differences in the high-performance variant of this technique.
