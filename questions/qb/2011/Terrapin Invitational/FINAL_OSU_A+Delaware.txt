answer: {Typhon}

In Orphism, this being is believed to have killed Zagreus who would later be reincarnated as Dionysus. This figure's death was preceded by him cutting out Zeus's sinews and imprisoning him in the Coryican cave. Instead of fingers, this being had fifty dragon heads on each of his hands, and vipers instead of legs. The last child of (*) Tartarus and Gaia, this largest creature in Greek mythology stood as high as the heavens. The Lernaean Hydra, Nemean Lion, Sphynx, and Cerberus were all offspring of his with his wife, Echidna. Zeus eventually defeated this being by throwing the island of Sicily on top of him, trapping him beneath Mount Etna. For ten points, name this fearsome monster from Greek mythology whose influence over strong storm winds is the etymology for a pacific hurricane.

answer: {Aldehydes} [prompt on "{carbonyl}" before mentioned]

The action of hexamine and water convert a benzyl halide to this functional group in the Sommelet reaction. This functional group can be formed by reaction with the Jones reagent only if it does not form a hydrate, and this functional group is created via palladium catalysis from ethene in the Wacker process. These can be created by the three-three sigmatropic rearrangement of allyl vinyl ethers in a rearrangement named for (*) Claisen. This functional group is converted first to a dibromoalkene and then alkyne in the Corey Fuchs reaction, and two of these functional groups react in a disproportionation that competes with the aldol condensation named for Cannizaro. For 10 points, name this functional group that produces a silver mirror in the Tollen's test and, similar to a ketone, consists of a terminal carbonyl.

answer: {Cao Dai}

Initiates in this religion face a probation period of six months, and one vow taken by new members asserts an understanding that failure to uphold this religion’s regulations will result in “extermin[ation] by Heaven and Earth.” This religion mandates four daily ceremonies starting at 6AM and occurring every six hours. This religion sees itself as the third and final Religious (*) Amnesty offered by God, the previous two of which included faiths that are grouped into such categories as the Doctrine of the Sages, the Doctrine of the Genies, and the Doctrine of the Buddhas. Though it is not Catholicism, this religion’s structure consists of Archbishops and a Pope, and its name literally translates to “High Tower.” FTP, name this syncretic Vietnamese religion whose saints notably include Sun Yat-sen and Victor Hugo.

answer: {Griswold} v. Connecticut

Support for this case was galvanized by a dissenting opinion authored four years prior which argued that liberty was a “rational continuum” and condemned the court's dismissal of several suits filed against State's Attorney Ullman. Those cases had been dismissed over a lack of standing, prompting the namesake appellant and C. Lee Buxton to induce a $100 fine by violating a seldom-used law that was called “uncommonly silly” in Potter (*) Stewart's dissent. Goldberg's concurrence relied shakily on the 9th Amendment in this case, expanded in Eisenstadt v. Baird, while Harlan's reliance on substantive due process supplanted Douglas's majority opinion about the “penumbras” of the Bill of Rights. Famously establishing a constitutional right to privacy and a major precursor to Roe v. Wade, for 10 points, name this 1965 case that struck down a law banning contraceptives in Connecticut.

In another scene, the narrator is punished for dancing with the most beautiful girl in the school by having the tip of his finger cut off by bullies. The narrator loses his memory when he is 'purified' by a silver (*) spittoon, and near the end of his life he complains that Dr. Balliga dismissed his fear that his body is developing cracks. The narrator's punishment for seeing his mother use the toilet is prohibition from speaking for one day, at which point he realizes his is telepathic. For ten points, name this novel by Salman Rushdie about Saleem Sinai who was born at the title hour of Indian independence.

answer: {How} the Other {Half Lives}: Studies Among the Tenements of New York

The final portion of this work praises the “experiment” of A.T. White shortly after considering a man who dove into a crowd of holiday shoppers and began shanking them, while Lewis Hine is among those who imitated the style of this work. Eighteen young children who sit in a semi-circle are the subject of one part of this work, which wonders why Chinese people prefer carrying knives in their sleeves when every black man knows the best place is the boot. Prayer Time in the Nursery and (*) Bandit's Roost appear in this work, which grew from a Scribner's Christmas article. The recent advent of magnesium powder may be responsible for the haunting, startled stares of this work's subjects, who are found in “the Bend” and “Jewtown” in the Lower East Side. A series of “Studies Among the Tenements of New York,” for 10 points, name this muckraking work of photojournalism that exposed the horrid conditions of New York's poor.

answer: Sergei {Rachmaninoff}

A D minor work by this composer sees the adagio F sharp minor second movement's transition to the the alla breve finale orchestrated attacca, or without pause, which followed a similar C minor piece, which sees an E flat major theme supplant the half step-filled piano arpeggios. A four-note “signature” ends both those piano concertos by this man, whose first opera sees the title character marry and then murder the gypsy Zemfira. This composer of Aleko collected Thirteen (*) Preludes, Ten Preludes, and Prelude in C-Sharp Minor into a group covering all twenty-four musical keys. This creator of the formidable Etudes Tableaux used 5/8 time to suggest the act of rowing in a piece inspired by a Bocklin painting, his Isle of the Dead. His characteristic widely-spaced chords are evident in his setting of Poe's The Bells, while his most famous work consists of mostly A minor variations on another man's Caprice No. 24. For 10 points, name this Russian composer of Rhapsody on a Theme from Paganini..

answer: Rainer Maria {Rilke}

One of this man's poems describes how the title bird "diving like an angel struck the hern," while another work by this poet compares him to a falcon, storm, and a song while comparing God to an ancient tower and consists of a series of “Love Poems to God” in his “The Book of Hours.” One poem by this author concludes with the demand "You must change your life" after describing an unknown "legendary (*) head with eyes like ripening fruit," while one of his collections about the is divided into sections of twenty six and twenty nine poems, and that work was dedicated to his daughter’s friend Vera Knoop. His best known set of poems glorifies unrequited love and heartbreak and ask “Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angelic orders?” For ten points, name this Bohemian-Austrian poet who wrote Sonnets to Orpheus and Duino Elegies.

answer: The {Fall} of {Constantinople} [accept any reasonable equivalent {involving something bad happening} to {Constantinople}]

This event gave Ivan the Great's second wife Sophia the justification to launch a cultural overhaul of the Muscovite court. A key account of it comes from Cardinal Isidore of Kiev, who described hastily swapping clothes with a corpse in a letter to Pope Nicholas V. In the wake of this event, Philip the Good got his drink on at the Feast of the Pheasant. A fortress with towers named for three prominent generals, the (*) Rumeli Hisari, was built prior to this event, which saw key mercenary participation by Genoese captain Giovanni Giustiniani and a Hungarian metallurgist named Orban, who constructed shockingly massive artillery. A chain stretching from the Galata Tower forced a fleet to be dragged overland to reach the Golden Horn in this event, which ended with three days of loot-tastic pillaging. Seeing Constantine XI succumb to Mehmed II's Ottoman forces, for 10 points, name this 1453 siege of the Byzantine capital.

answer: {Microtubules} [prompt on "{tubulin}" before mentioned]

The protein FtsZ, which is found only in bacteria, is said to be the progenitor of this structure. One type of this structure designated g combines with gamma ring proteins to form a ring complex that nucleates these entities. Their rapid changes between growth and shrinkage due to the hydrolysis of a GTP cap is known as (*) dynamic instability, while taxol and tau proteins can be used to stabilize these. Dyneins and kinesins move molecules across these structures, which are associated with MAPs. During mitosis, their namesake organizing centers are created and these attach to the kinetochore. For 10 points, name this part of the cytoskeleton, which are found in cilia and flagella and which are made of tubulin.
