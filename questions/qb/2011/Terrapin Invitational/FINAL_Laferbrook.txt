answer: {War Powers} Act

This legislation was the subject of the appeals court case Campbell v. Clinton, which did not result in a ruling, holding instead that Tom Campbell and other House members lacked standing to bring suit. Primarily sponsored in the Senate by Jacob Javits, this legislation came under attack in 1988 by Sam Nunn, John Warner, and George Mitchell, who called it ineffective because it (*) “oversteps Constitutional bounds.” This legislation’s reporting requirement defined a 48-hour window for submitting an explanatory report, while the next section held that within 60 days of submitting the report, all armed forces had to be withdrawn barring specific authorization or a formal declaration. Passed over Nixon’s veto in 1973, for 10 points, identify this legislation which sought to limit the unilateral use of the military by the executive branch.

answer: The {Flying Dutchman} (or Der {fliegende Hollander})

This opera's composer transferred the setting from Scotland after the libretto of Eugene Scribe was used to produce an inferior work by Pierre-Louis Dietsch, while Heinrich Marschner's opera Der Vampyr was a major influence on this opera's central romance. Arias in this opera include “Willst Jenes Tags du Nicht,” sung by the huntsman Erik to his former love, the female protagonist, and (*) “Die Frist is Um”, in which the title character yearns for death. Notable sections of this opera include the Spinners' Chorus in Act II, which takes place in the house of Senta, and the Sailor's Chorus in Act III. For 10 points, name this 1843 opera that sees a curse broken after a deal is brokered with Captain Daland, an early work of Wagner about the captain of a cursed ship.

answer: {groups}

The Novikov-Boone-Britton Theorem proves the undecidability of the word problem for these mathematical objects.  The number of subsets fixed by their elements is proportional to the number of orbits according to Burnside's Lemma. If "p to the n" is the largest power of prime p that divides the order of one of these objects, then it contains a sub-object of size "p to the n" according to (*) Sylow's Theorem. A sub-object of one of these objects must have an order that divides the order of the original object according to Lagrange's Theorem. These objects are defined as monoids which include inverse elements, and their namesake axioms include closure and the presence of an identity element. These objects consist of a set and a single binary operation, and are called Abelian when they commute. For 10 points, name these mathematical objects studied in abstract algebra that are more general than a ring.

answer: {Seventh} Day {Adventists} (prompt on “{Millerites}”, do not prompt on “{Adventist}”)

This group had its origins in Hiram Edson’s interpretation of a certain religious text, and Ellet Waggoner and Alonzo Jones challenged this group’s belief in sola scriptura, holding instead that salvation came from grace. The visions of Ellen Harmon were used by James White to organize this religious group, and those visions were also believed to have validated this denomination’s sanctuary, shut-door, and (*) “sabbattarian” doctines. This denomination’s founder used the Book of Daniel to predict that 2300 years after Artaxerxes ordered the rebuilding of Jerusalem, a “second awakening,” would occur; the failure of this to take place was known as this denomination’s “great disappointment.” For ten points, identify this Christian denomination founded based on the teachings of William Miller, whose name suggests the unique day on which they observe the Sabbath.

answer: {Nicomachean Ethics}

This work claims that the good of anything with a function lies in the satisfactory performance of that function, and asserts that the function of a human is rational activity. This text’s definition of happiness insists that happiness be evaluated over the course of a complete life, so that children cannot be said to be happy and Priam cannot be unhappy just because he is experiencing old age. This work claims mere (*) strength of will to be less praiseworthy than active virtue, but more so than weakness of will, or incontinence, and asserts that the virtue of a particular trait usually lies between two extremes in its “doctrine of the mean.” FTP, name this work that suggests adhering to that doctrine in order to attain eudaimonia, a work attributed to Aristotle and named for his son.

answer: {cytochrome c}

This molecule accepts electrons from an enzyme that contains an iron-sulfur subunit known as a Rieske protein. This molecule acts as an electron donor to the P960 chlorophyll pair in some forms of bacterial photosynthesis, and interactions with it and its peroxidase play a prominent role in peroxide scavenging. A protein with a similar role to this one is the Diablo homolog, also known as SMAC. This molecule is released when proteins such as BID and Bax open up an oligomeric pore in the membrane of a certain organelle. (*) Cyanide poisoning functions by preventing this molecule's oxidase from reducing oxygen to water. In apoptosis, this protein combines with Apaf-1 to form the apoptosome heptamer. For ten points, name this iron-containing protein that passes electrons between complex III and complex IV in the electron transport chain.

This man's version of the Marriage at Cana bears some remarkable similarities to Breughel's Peasant Wedding. His last major work, a massive scene whose leaning figures create an oblong “V” from the central action, depicts a circle of warm light at center top over an object whose vertical rise from a mass of mourners sharply divides the painting. That Crucifixion is found in the same city for whose Scuole Grandi he painted a series showing citizens discovering – and then absconding with – the corpse of the central saint. A white-turbaned man pulls back a (*) hammer to nail the titular poor naked bastard to the ground in this man's rendering of Saint Mark descending to the rescue, The Miracle of the Slave. Venice's San Giorgio Maggiore is home to this man's painting that shows a woman at right reaching into a bucket of water and a flaming lamp at top left, illuminating ethereal angels who flit above a long, slanted table.

One class of these molecules was labeled by Trofimenko as "scorpionate," and includes several polyborate compounds. One of these known as FLT3 is a hematopoietic cytokine that binds to the tyrosine kinase receptor. The Hill coefficient is derived from calculating the concentration of these molecules. These aren't acids or bases, but they can be classified as hard or soft depending on their polarizability. The names of these molecules are often prefaced by a number and the letter (*) eta - that number is the hapticity of these molecules, which is the number of carbon atoms they are bonded to. These systems may be described as polydentate when they are attached by bonds from two or more donor atoms, and they are the basis of a namesake field theory developed from crystal field theory. FTP, name these entities which consist of a molecule bonded to a central metal atom in a coordination complex.

answer: {equipartition} theorem

This statement can be derived from first principles by noting that under certain conditions, the function Z depends only on the thermodynamic beta to the minus-one-half, and evaluating the derivative of the log of that function with respect to beta.  Debye's theory of heat capacity reduces to the Dulong-Petit law in the high-temperature limit as a direct consequence of this statement. The truth of this statement depends on the truth of the (*) ergodic hypothesis, and this statement is a direct consequence of the fact that in a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the numerator of the exponent is the kinetic energy of the molecule. For ten points, identify this theorem which at equilibrium allocates energy equal to one-half times Boltzmann's constant times the temperature for every quadratic degree of freedom.

answer: {Kruskal’s} Algorithm

One modification to this algorithm improves on its running time by replacing its primary data structure with a number of leftist binary trees, which can be easily merged; that modification is the Cheriton-Tarjan algorithm. The amortized run-time of one subsection of this algorithm is a notable instance of the inverse Ackermann function appearing in time complexity. The optimizations of "union by rank" and "path compression" can be used to improve on a subsection of this algorithm known as the union-find algorithm. This algorithm has running time "Big O of (*) E log E" where E is the number of edges, since the dominating step in this algorithm is sorting the edges by weight. It works by iteratively choosing the lowest weight edge that connects two previously unconnected components in the graph. For 10 points, name this graph algorithm that, like Boruvka's algorithm and Prim's algorithm, finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
