answer: {Ferromagnetism}

The permeability of substances exhibiting this is given by the Stoletov Curve while certain combinations of copper, manganese and aluminium also exhibit this behavior. Only elements with partially filled electron shells, such as Gadolinium and Dysprosium, exhibit this behavior. Below a critical temperature a substance exhibiting this will undergo spontaneous magnetization, but above that critical temperature named for Curie, thermal motion in a substance causes its magnetic dipoles to lose their alignment and the substance to lose this property. For ten points name this “permanent” type of magnetism often compared with paramagnetism and diamagnetism.

Because this effect usually produces low-intensity signals, an apparatus consisting of serial dynodes which amplify incoming signals are used in this type of spectroscopy. In one technique, resonant transfer of energy via this effect induces a signal from a nearby chromophore. It is used along with flow cytometry to sort cells in one technique, while the former technique is used to study protein-protein interactions and is called FRET. This effect occurs due to relaxation from an excited state without going through a triplet state.  For 10 points, identify this effect in which a substance emits light of a longer wavelength than the one it absorbs, which only lasts for short durations as opposed to phosphorescence.
