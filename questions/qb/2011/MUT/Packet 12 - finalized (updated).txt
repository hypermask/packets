Clays from this region have glassy spherules with limestone-like chemistry, and another characteristic of this region is the presence of quartz with various criss-cross patterns. Abnormally high concentrations of a transition element at this region led to a proposition that the Chicxulub Crater was caused by a meteor striking the Earth, and was advanced by Walter and Luis Alvarez. It is thought that the dinosaurs died out at the same time that this rock layer was formed from dust and debris from a meteor about 65.5 million years ago. For 10 points, identify this layer of rocks that mark the distinction between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods.

answer: {Activation} Energy

Kissinger’s method and Ozawa’s method are used to calculate this parameter using thermogravimetric data. For complex reactions such as the pyrolysis of coal, this quantity is assumed to have a probability distribution. This quantity can be expressed as the negative product of RT times the natural log of the reaction rate coefficient over the frequency factor, and the difference between the starting point and the highest point on a reaction coordinate diagram gives this quantity. Catalysts increase the rate of a reaction by providing a mechanism with a lower value of this quantity. For 10 points, name this energy barrier, the minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction, which is symbolized Ea.

answer: electric charge

For a baryon, this quantity is related to Baryon number, isospin, and strangeness according to the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula. Dirac showed that the existence of a magnetic monopole would lead to a quantization of this quantity. A measure for this which is “effectively” felt by a valence electron is used to calculate electronegativity in the Allred-Rochow scale. Mass, angular momentum, and this are the only quantities which characterize black holes according to the “no hair” theorem. The flux at the surface of an arbitrary volume is proportional to this quantity according to Gauss’ law for electric fields. For 10 points, identify this property which is carried by electrons and protons but not neutrons.
