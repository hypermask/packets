answer: {oncogenes}

One condition is caused when c-myc, [see-mick] an example of these, is translocated close to the enhancer for antibody heavy chains. The first known one was the src gene discovered in RSV. ABT737 targets one of these named bcl2 which inhibits the formation of certain pores during apoptosis. They can be categorized into broad classes such as growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and other signaling GTPases. The two hit-loss of function makes tumor suppressor genes potent, and  has the same effect as a gain of function mutation in one of these genes. For 10 points, name these genes that cause cancer.

answer: {Friction}

Models for one form of this phenomenon suggest that asperity junctions are deformed in one regime, while all such junctions are broken in regimes where velocity becomes important. This phenomenon abnormally decreases as a function of velocity in the Stribeck effect, though the dynamics of the system change with the formation of a fluid film. Because it arises due to intermolecular forces, it is dependent to composition, though it is independent of the surface area of a body. Amontons’ first law states that it is directly proportional to the mass of the object. The coefficient of the static form of this is generally larger than the kinetic form. For 10 points, identify this force that resists motion.

answer: {nuclear} magnetic resonance spectroscopy [accept {NMR spectroscopy}]

Ramp cross-polarization is used for coherence transfer in “inverse” forms of these experiments, while an orientation at which cosine-squared equals one third is used to enhance resolution in some forms of this technique. Tetramethylsilane is used to create a standard in this technique because it is chemically inert and because its values do not interfere with those of the compounds being studied. The difference in resonance frequencies of the molecule being studied and the standard over the frequency gives the chemical shift, which is plotted in this technique. For 10 points, name this type of spectroscopy in which a magnetic field is introduced to a sample of atoms.
