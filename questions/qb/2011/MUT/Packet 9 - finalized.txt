The CLIPER models use statistical equations to predict zonal and meridional movements in these phenomena. The BAM model predicts their trajectory as a function of the vertically-averaged horizontal wind at shallow, middle, and deep layers, and has a beta parameter corrects for the variation in Coriolis forces with latitude changes. They don’t occur near the equator because of weak Coriolis forces. Stages leading up to them are called tropical depressions and tropical storms, and their intensities are measured on the Saffir Simpson scale.  For 10 points, identify these phenomena which have windspeeds greater than 74 MPH, recent examples of which include Andrew and Katrina.
