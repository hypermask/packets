answer: {idolatry} [accept things like {worshipping idols}, {praying} to {graven images} before mentioned etc...]

The Jewish interpretation of this practice can be found in the section of the Mishneh Torah called "Hilkhot Avodat Kokhavim". In Hinduism, this practice is known as "puja murti" and is deemed important by the Bhagavad Gita because men desire to "perceive through their senses". Sikhs reject this practice in favor of meditation on "shabad", or God's word. In Islam, one must commit to tawhid, or monotheism, and avoid this practice, which is called "shirk". Protestants have often accused Catholics of conflating the "dulia" and "latria" forms of this practice, and it is mandatory in Orthodox Christianity in the form of icon veneration. For 10 points, name this religious taboo forbidden by the second commandment that involves praying to images instead of God himself.
