answer: Karl Heinrich {Marx}

One work by this thinker claimed that everyone receives from society what he gives it; that work introduces the lower and higher phases of a certain philosophy. Another work by this man distinguishes between the civil base and the political superstructure of society. He claimed that the focus of new materialism was human society in a work that criticized the contemplative philosophy of the author of The Essence of Christianity. He claimed that society has developed a fetish for commodities and holds exchange value above labor and use value, and he distinguished his thought from French socialism in a work that urged the workers of the world to unite. For 10 points, name this German philosopher who collaborated with Engels on works like The Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital.

answer: The {Planets} suite [accept {Gustav Holst’s Opus 32} until read]

In the opening section of this work, a muted trumpet and six hand-stopped horns play over a col legno melody in the strings. The fifth section of this work features a B-minor melody played by the strings and the trombones over timpani and is interrupted in the middle by frantically ringing bells, while music from the fourth section of this work was used as the setting for poem by Cecil Spring-Rice called “I Vow to Thee, My Country”.

answer: “The {Lady} of {Shalott}”

The third stanza of this poem tells of “heavy barges trail’d / by slow horses” and describes how “the shallop flitteth silken-sail’d”. This poem describes a location consisting of “four grey walls and four grey towers” that “overlook a space of flowers,” while its central character is heard only by “reapers, reaping early, in among the bearded barley.” This poem’s title character laments being “half sick of shadows” before a man who sings “tirra lirra” causes her mirror to crack from side to side. Its title character “weaves by night and day a magic web of colours gay” because she is cursed not to look at Camelot, but she eventually dies after seeing Sir Lancelot. For 10 points, name this poem about the title castle-bound maiden, a work of Lord Tennyson.

answer: {observation} [or {measuring}; accept word forms]

Sudarshan and Mishra hypothesized that performing this frequently will cause the “freezing” of the evolution of a system via the quantum zeno effect. Doing this splits the universe into the number of possible outcomes for this process according to the many worlds theory. According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, this process cannot be simultaneously performed with arbitrary precision for commuting variables. For 10 points, identify this process which would cause the collapse of a system into a particular energy eigenstate, as exemplified by opening the box with Schrodinger’s cat in it.

answer: {Circadian} rhythms [accept {Circadian clocks}]

In plants, this phenomenon is usually studied using a luciferase reporter assay, and it is hypothesized that auxin sensitivity is regulated by this phenomenon. A plot of the phase shift and the time of stimulus is useful in understanding this phenomenon. Certain retinal ganglia project directly to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which regulates this phenomenon, and it is also influenced by melatonin secretions from the pineal gland. Light is thought to be the major environmental cue triggering it. For 10 points, identify these rhythms that regulate behavior and physiology such as sleep patterns.

answer: Jean William Fritz {Piaget}

One key idea of this thinker was adaptation, which occurred by taking material in from the environment and noting their differences through assimilation and accommodation. In one experiment, this psychologist established the notion of "conservation of number" by rearranging the same number of objects, demonstrating that children lack it  until the age of 7. He proposed that children from the age of 2-7 learn to use language to represent objects, but classify them only by a single characteristic and are egocentric. That group was classified as "preoperational", which followed this man’s "sensorimotor" stage. For 10 points each, identify this Swiss psychologist who developed four stages of cognitive development.

answer: {Loki Laufeyarson} [accept {Loge}]

In the Fjollvinnsmal, this deity was said to have plucked and engraved with runes the wand Laevateinn. He is the son of Farbauti and brother of Byleistr and Helblindi, and one of his sons is turned into a wolf who promptly rips out the throat of his other son, whose entrails are used to bind him. He once borrowed a cloak to rescue a goddess from Thrymheim, after having earlier been tricked by Thiazi into allowing that goddess, Idunn, to be captured. This god once lost an eating contest to a similarly-named personification of fire while accompanying Thor to the court of Utgard-Loki, and he is also the mother of Sleipnir. His wife Sigyn catches the poison that eternally falls on him, a punishment he earned in part for tricking Hodr into killing his brother. For 10 points, identify this Norse trickster god.

answer: First Battle of the {Marne} [accept {Battle} of the {Marne} after “a {later battle}”]

This battle came shortly after the battle of St. Quentin, which ended the career of Charles Lanrezac, prompting the promotion of Louis Franchet d’Esperey. This battle occurred after the Frontiers series of skirmishes. Joseph Joffre kept Joseph Gallieni away from the front, although the latter was praised for his handling of reserve forces. The key moment in this battle came when reserves arrived in taxi cabs from Paris, prompting a surge which caused Helmuth von Moltke’s forces to retreat and abandon the Schlieffen Plan. A later battle at this same site saw Erich Ludendorff’s forces defeated by Ferdinand Foch during the 1918 Spring Offensive. For 10 points, name this 1914 World War I battle, which halted the German offense on Paris and began the trench warfare phase.

One person with this last name is the namesake of the coefficients of the Taylor series for x over the quantity e to the x minus 1 centered at x = 0. Another person with this last name lends his name to a theory along with Euler that gives an equation governing the transverse deflection of a beam as a function of its flexural rigidity and the applied load. The former lends his name to a process in which the outcomes of independent experiments can only be “successes” and “failures” with fixed probability, exemplified by a coin toss. The latter lends his name to an analog of the conservation of energy that describes inviscid flow. For 10 points, identify this family of Swiss scientists, one of whom names a principle from fluid mechanics.

The central feature of that work dominates the center of its triumphal arches and the semi-circular structure directly in front of it. Leonardo Sormani designed a much-ridiculed statue of Moses that stood at the center of one of these structures. The Palazzo Poli forms the backdrop to one of these, whose two central Corinthian columns flank a standing figure of Oceanus.

The Reid method is used to calculate the vapor pressure of inputs and outputs for this process. Visbreaking is the reduction of the viscosity of straight run residues in this process, and those residues are separated in low pressure chambers via vacuum flashing. Long chain products of this process are broken down via FCC reactions to yield low boiling, low molecular weight products. After the inputs are passed through a boiler, this activity involves separating them through a fractional distillation tower, which captures light materials such as naphtha at the top. For 10 points, identify this activity, which results in the production of kerosene, diesel, and gasoline from a black liquid.

Joan Miro adapted scenery from this painting in his The Tilled Field, while Wilhelm Franger believed that this work was commissioned by the Grand Master of a secret society dedicated to spreading pure lust across Europe. This work drew from expedition journals in its depiction of a bleached-white giraffe, and in the bottom right of this work a pig wearing a cowl kisses a man on the cheek. Its depiction of a large fruit in the center panel gave it the nickname “the Strawberry Painting”. The bottom left of this work depicts the moment when Adam and Eve first meet, while an image of the world’s creation is shown if this painting’s left and right panels are closed.

One leader of this group slaughtered the party of Piet Retief, prompting a conflict that ended with this group’s loss at Blood River to Andres Pretorius. This group unsuccessfully besieged a fortress at Rorke’s Drift during one conflict. These people lost the battles of Ulundi, but scored a major victory over the British at Isandlwana, with the “buffalo horns formation” perfectly utilized by King Cethswayo’s forces. For 10 points, name this South African ethnic group, notably led by King Shaka.
