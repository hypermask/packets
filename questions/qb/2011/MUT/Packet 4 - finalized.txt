answer: {cAMP} [Accept {cyclic adenosine monophosphate} or {cyclic AMP}]

Signals of this molecule result in activation of proteins that bind to the sequence TGACGTCA. This molecule binds to the catabolite activator protein that controls the expression of the lac operon in E. coli. Four molecules of it facilitate the activation of a protein by separating its R and C subunits. It was discovered by Sutherland and it activates protein kinase A. The production of this molecule is usually inhibited when glucose molecules enter the cell, and this compound is degraded by phosphodiesterase.  For 10 points, name this molecule that is synthesized from ATP by adenylate cyclase, which acts as a second messenger molecule in cells.

One of this man’s theories suggests that the Sommerfeld-Wilson quantization is required to hold for an internal clock to stay in phase with a guiding wave.
