answer: {Torque}

It is not the luminiferous ether, but in the Trouton Noble experiment, a zero measure for this quantity caused a null result for changes in the orientation of a parallel-plate capacitor. In a type of motion, the absence of this phenomenon causes the right-hand-sides of the Euler angles to become zero, and it is given by the magnetic moment cross the b-field for a current loop. When the angle between the spinning and vertical axis remains constant during rotation, the precessing motion is said to be induced to this phenomenon. This vector quantity is equal to the rate of change of angular momentum. For 10 points, identify this quantity which describes the force required to push open a door at various distances from the hinges.

Two major figures discussed in this work are compared to two ballet dancers: one who can hold a poseduring a leap and a landing and one who leaps beautifully but lands awkwardly. One section of this work examines the difference between “disclosure” and “hiddenness” in a story from Aristotle’s Poetics about a groom whois told by the Oracle of Delphi that his marriage will bring disaster and in the myth of Amor and Psyche.This work examines a biblical passage from four angles in its section “Exordium” before comparing theKnight of Faith with the Knight of Infinite Resignation. This work asks the question “Is there a teleologicalsuspension of the ethical?” as one its three “Problemata.” Written under the pseudonym Johannes deSilentio, for 10 points, name this work analyzing the sacrifice of Isaac, by Soren Kierkegaard.

answer: {vapor} pressure [prompt on partial]

The gravametric Knudson method to measure this quantity involves holding the analyte in a capsule with a hole, and is mainly used when expected values for this quantity are small. Three substance specific quantities can be plugged into the Antoine equation to give this quantity. The Clausius-Clayperon equation suggests that knowledge of this quantity at a specific temperature allows its calculation any other temperature along a coexistence curve. It is equivalent to the equilibrium constant for the phase change of a liquid to a gas. For 10 points, identify this quantity for a 2-phase mixture of a liquid which must be equal to the atmospheric pressure at the boiling point.

answer: mitochondria

Cardiolipin is a so called “double” lipid with four fatty acid tails that is abundant in this organelle. Thermogenin acts as an uncoupler of one process that occurs in these structures in brown fat cells, which get their color due to the abundance of these structures. The F1 complex of a protein found in this structure has been shown to be water soluable, and that protein’s F0 complex is a transmembrane domain that releases its product onto the F1 complex. Cytochrome C is a peripheral protein found in the intermembrane space of this organelle, and secretion of that enzyme serves as a signal to trigger apoptosis. For 10 points, name this semi-autonomous organelle, where the bulk of ADP phosphorylation occurs, often called the “powerhouse of the cell.”

A theory pertaining to the transfer of these items uses a quantity equal to the energy required to bring the system to its final reaction coordinates under certain conditions, and won Rudolf Marcus the 1927 Nobel in Chemistry. In the post-Hartree-Fock methods, the configuration interaction functions try to correct for neglecting the correlation energy between these particles. Nitro and halide groups “withdraw” these particles from an aromatic ring. The outer most sets of these which don’t participate in bonding are called “lone pairs” and are represented in Lewis structures. For 10 points, identify these particles which carry a negative charge.
