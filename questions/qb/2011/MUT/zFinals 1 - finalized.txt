answer: {bone} tissue or {osseus} tissue

Transverse structures in this tissue are called Volkmann’s canals, and this tissue is classified as either trabecular or cortical. “Morphogenic proteins” of this tissue were discovered by Urist and belong to the TGF-beta superfamily. Caneliculi, which are separated by lamelle, are concentric rings that form around central Haversian canals in this tissue. Some structures composed of this tissue are made up of epiphysis on both ends and diaphysis in the central region. Resorption of this tissue to allow for the passage of blood vessels is performed by osteoclasts, and osteoblasts generate this type of tissue. For 10 points, name this tissue that makes up structures such as the femur.

One of this non-Henry James author’s protagonists is inspired by such books as Ernest Renan’s Life of Jesus and is advised to seek “the figure in the carpet” by the poetaster Cronshaw. In another of his novels, a bottle of Zubrowka tempts Sophie Macdonald back into alcoholism, while the protagonist uses the hypnotic powers he’d learned in India to cure Gray Maturin, the husband of his ex-fiancée Isabel. The protagonist of his most famous work lives for a time with Norah Nesbit and carries on a tumultuous romance with Mildred Rogers, but is finally able to find peace with Thorpe Athelney’s daughter Sally. For 10 points, identify this author who created Larry Darrell and Philip Carey in The Razor’s Edge and Of Human Bondage, respectively.

answer: {cis/trans} [{need both}; accept {cis/trans acting elements} or {cis/trans isomerism} or {cis/trans faces} at any point]

Two answers required. These two terms denote “acting elements” which are promoter sequences of DNA that complex with transcription factors and transcription factors produced remotely that bind to the promoter sequences. The ends of the Golgi body that are towards the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane are referred to by these two names.

answer: {Carrie}: A Portrait of a Girl

One scene in this movie centers on the reading of a plagiarized poem that includes the line “What are you going to leave for us, you people in your cars, spewing pollution into the air?” Shortly thereafter, a calisthenics montage is interspersed with scenes depicting the protagonist finding the book The Secret Science behind Miracles. The sight of a neighbor sunbathing topless prompts its protagonist’s mother to use the term “dirtypillows.” One character in this film makes her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, ask out its protagonist, to make up for an earlier tampon-throwing incident. Tommy ends up dying, though, when he receives a blow to the head with a bucket after Billy Nolan and Chris Hargensen drop pig blood on its protagonist.  For 10 points, name this film about the titular telekinetic girl who wreaks havoc on prom night, based on a novel by Stephen King.

answer: {resistance}

This property diverges in metals with magnetic impurities as the temperature tends to absolute zero, an example of asymptotic freedom known as the Kondo effect. The von Klitzing constant observed in the quantum Hall effect takes the units of this electrical property, and allows for it to be measured extremely precisely. A braided Litz wire must be used to counter this property’s increase in AC circuits due to the skin effect. In AC circuits, this is the real quantity added to the reactance to calculate the impedance. For 10 points, name this electrical property whose SI unit is the ohm, which measures a circuit element’s opposition to the passage of current.

answer: {Being} and {Time} [or accept {Sein und Zeit}]

One part of this work uses the example of how an illness becomes apparent through its symptoms to re-define “appearance” not as something that presents itself, but as something that announces itself “by notshowing itself.” Another chapter discusses the goal of “destroying the history of ontology.” This workuses the example of how people don’t think about using a hammer until it breaks to distinguish betweenthings that are “present-at-hand” rather than “ready-to-hand.” This work differentiates between fear,which is caused by something definite, and angst, which is caused by something indefinite, after outlininginauthenticity and authenticity as the two modes of possibility for the book’s central concept of “Dasein.”For 10 points, name this masterpiece of Martin Heidegger.

answer: {Noh} drama [accept {Nogaku}]

W.B. Yeats’s At the Hawk’s Well was adapted from a work in this genre which sees a fisherman convince a spirit to dance for him in exchange for the return of the spirit’s feather-mantle. One well-known work in this genre sees a group of priests exorcise a female demon who’d trapped herself in a gigantic bell, while another exemplar of this genre centers on two salt-making sisters who haunt a bay after being abandoned by a courtier. Works in this genre often use a set consisting primarily of a painting of a pine tree and are often performed alongside farcical works called kyogen. Dojoji and Matsukaze are prominent examples of this genre, which was pioneered by Kan’ami and his son Zeami. For 10 points, identify this genre of Japanese drama, noted for its prominent use of masks.

answer: {nationalism} [{no} other answer is acceptable]

The coiner of this term, J.G. Herder, linked it to the idea of Volk and the premise that each culture is a unique expression of humanitat, the human essence. Anthony D. Smith pioneered the interdisciplinary study of this concept, which did not exist in the “agro-literate” stage of history, but arose out of necessity for context-free communication in a modern industrial society, according to the work of Ernest Gellner. In another work, this concept is said to arise from “print-capitalism,” which causes the emergence of the title Imagined Communities. For 10 points, name this concept, studied by Benedict Anderson, which describes the strong identification of a populace with its own state.

After one notable incident at this location, Operation Yellowbird attempted to help people escape. Student protests at this site during the May Fourth Movement of 1919 denounced the Treaty of Versailles. This site is the home to a ten-story obelisk called the “Monument to the People’s Heroes.” In 1976, mass public displays of mourning at this site prompted disciplinary actions initiated by the Gang of Four. This location is best remembered for the June Fourth Incident, which began after the death of Hu Yaobang and saw a man in a white shirt defiantly stand in front of approaching tanks. For 10 points, name this location in the center of Beijing, the site of infamous 1989 protests against the Chinese government.

answer: {third} law of {thermodynamics} [accept “{Nernst heat theorem}” until mentioned]

An implication of this law is that adiabatic demagnetization cannot be used to bring down a system to thermal energies below kBT [kay-bee-tee]. One consequence of this law is that expansivity coefficients, constant volume heat capacity, and the slope of P-T curves on a phase diagram must all approach zero at certain conditions. Sometimes called the Nernst heat theorem, it implies that at a certain temperature, any chemical reaction cannot generate entropy. For 10 points, identify this law which states that at absolute zero, the entropy of a perfect compound is zero, which comes after a law about the increase of entropy for irreversible processes.

answer: the {Spanish Golden Age} [or {Golden Century}; or {Siglo} de {Oro}]

One playwright from this period was known as the “Phoenix of Wits,” and translations of his works may be the source of the phrase “cloak and dagger.” One play from this period was the first treatment of a story that later inspired Pushkin’s The Stone Guest. Two feuding poets during this period pioneered contrasting styles known as Culteranismo and Conceptismo. One play from this period focuses on the King of Poland, who locks his son Seigismundo in a tower. For 10 points, name this literary period during which the playwrights Lope de Vega and Calderon de la Barca flourished and novelist Miguel de Cervantes wrote Don Quixote.
