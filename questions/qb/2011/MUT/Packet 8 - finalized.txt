answer: {pH}

A Harned [Har-ned] Cell is a device used for measuring this quantity, and other devices used to measure this quantity have an asymmtetry potential that arises due to the presence of an electrode. The attachment of a certain ion to a central nitrogen atom creates a positive charge on its adjacent nitrogen, which eventually leads to a distinctive change allowing its quantification. This quantity is related to the pKa according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and buffers minimize changes in this quantity for a system. For 10 points, identify this quantity that is equal to the negative log base 10 of the hydrogen ion activity, which for water equals 7.

The second part of this work outlines twelve rights of rulers and claims that men bind together in the state for self-preservation. That section also rejects aristocracy and democracy in favor of the more stable monarchy. This work proposes a way to avoid the “war of all against all” described in its first section, “Of Man”. That section of this work also defines life in nature as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”.
