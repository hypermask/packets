answer: Giuseppe {Arcimboldo} (or {Arcimboldi} )

One of this painter's earliest commissions was working with Giuseppe Meda on frescoes for the Cathedral of Monza. In a self-portrait, the numbers "6" and "1" can be seen over each eyebrow, meant to state the painter's age. The most famous of his early stained glass window designs can still be seen in the Como Cathedral. Much of his most famous work occurred while serving as court painter for Maximilian II, whose chancellor Ulrich Zasius this artist depicted as a "Jurist." He also served the emperor Rudolf II, whom he painted as Vertumnus. and did a series on the "Four Seasons" which illustrates his tradition of using items like tree roots and dead frogs to replace facial features. FTP, name this possibly unstable Italian painter of the 16th century, who inspired Surrealist artists with his allegorical depictions of various heads.

answer: “ {Death} of the {Hired Man} ”

One section of this poem states that “part of a moon was falling down the west, Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills," while another part near the end sees a character wonder whether a small sailing cloud will hit or miss the moon, but it hits the moon and splits in three. Another figure is said to have “nothing to look backward to with pride, And nothing to look forward to with hope," and is contrasted with a figure who "studied Latin, like the violin, because he liked it." After that argument with Harold Wilson, the poem declares “Home is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in.” At the end of this 175-line work, Mary’s husband Warren announces that the title event has occurred after Silas was assigned to a task. FTP, name this poem in North of Boston, a work by Robert Frost about the passing of a farmhand.

answer: {synchrotron} radiation [prompt on "{bremsstrahlung}" before mention, prompt on "{cyclotron radiation}" before mention]

This process is responsible for an experimentally observed variant of the Unruh effect named for Sokolov and Ternov. The LEP loses about 0.2 microwatt per electron due to this process, which can be described with a spectrum containing a modified Bessel function of five thirds order. Laboratories that generate it for intentional use include the Diamond Light Source and the Advanced Photon Source. Sinusoidal paths known as undulators or wigglers are commonly used in facilities that generate it. This can be considered as a specific case of bremsstrahlung, and the power emitted is given by the relativistic generalization of the Larmor formula. FTP, name this type of broad spectrum radiation produced by ultrarelativistic charged particles undergoing a radial acceleration.

answer: Treaty of {Lausanne}

During talks over this treaty, the U.S. separately negotiated the Chester concession for economic development, which would later be annulled. The related articles to this treaty were later superseded by the Montreaux Convention. This agreement included a list of 150 who were declared "persona non grata," mostly members of the previous government, though 600 names had originally been submitted to the conference that produced this treaty. An earlier treaty signed at the same location was also called the Treaty of Ouchy, and ended the Italo-Turkish War in 1912. By this treaty, the Dodecanese were ceded to Italy, Hatay was confirmed as Syrian territory, and a massive population exchange was agreed upon with Greece. This agreement, which was a re-negotiation of the Treaty of Sèvres, allowed more hopitable terms to the newly-formed Republic of Turkey than those posed to the Ottomans. FTP, name this 1923 treaty signed in Switzerland between the Allies and Turkey.

answer: {Yamata-no-Orochi} (prompt " {eight-forked serpent} ")

We are told that this figure has a body covered in moss, sprouting cypress trees and cedar trees, and that its eyes have a "winter cherry" color. To overcome this figure, two characters are instructed to distill some refined liquor and pour it into each of several vats located on a series of gates and platforms. That action is performed by the Foot-Stroking-Elder and the Hand-Stroking-Elder, who are distraught that this figure has abducted the princess Inada. As a result of this figure's defeat, the river Hi becomes a stream of blood. FTP, name this creature with eight heads and eight tails, which yields the sword Kusanagi, upon being slain by Susanowo.

answer: Igor {Stravinsky}

The premiere of one work by this man was marred by the last two systems of the score having been copied as only one, and the orchestra playing it that way. Despite that mishap, that triptych for orchestra by this man was later performed as a ballet called Ode. Another ballet by this man was based on an outline developed by Lincoln Kirstein, featured twelve dancers, twelve-tone music based on sixteenth-century dances, and was paired with the pieces Apollo and Orpheus in a set of three Greek ballets. Besides that work, Agon, this man’s ballets include one danced to the accompaniment of four pianos, percussion, and mixed chorus, depicting a wedding. The dances of the coachmen and wet-nurses occur in another work, in which this man prominently used a chord consisting of two major triads a tritone apart. FTP, name this composer of Petrushka.

answer: {Siswe Banzi} is {Dead}

Towards the beginning of this work, a character relates that he once had a problem with cockroaches so big that he entered his place and one on the wall said to him "who opened the door?" - insecticide fails to kill them, but his cat Blackie kills them in one night. That character impersonates the foreman "Baas Bradley" and tells the anecdote of Henry Ford Jr. visiting the Ford Motor Factory. At one point, a photograph comes to life and dictates a letter that will accompany the photo to King William's Town. Outside of a bar known as Sky's Shebeen, two characters find a man in a dumpster with a passbook on him, which is a work-seeker's permit. The title figure heads back to the photography studio of Styles after taking that man's identity. Like its author's play The Island, it was written in collaboration with John Kani and Winston Ntshona, and first performed in 1972. FTP, name this Athol Fugard play which revolves around a certain deceased guy.

answer: George {Herbert Walker Bush} (accept {Bush Sr.} or {Bush 41} or whatever)

George Edwards uses this man’s name for a “paradox” that presidential approval polls lag behind economic performance even when those polled say economic concerns are of high priority. Richard Fenno claims that this man’s tenure illustrates the failure of incrementalism as a governing philosophy, while Timothy Naftali argues the turning point in his presidency was his diagnosis with Graves disease. Minor scandals in his presidency included one regarding his ties to a criminal ring led by Orlando Bosch, whom he ultimately pardoned, and another concerning his part-ownership of Zapata Petroleum. Officials retained from his predecessor include press secretary Marlin Fitzwater and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, while other cabinet officials included Lauro Cavazos and long-time friends Robert Mosbacher and Secretary of State James Baker. Notable for pardoning Caspar Weinberger, FTP, identify this president who spoke about a "Thousand Points of Light" and initiated the Gulf War.

answer: {Tulsa} , Oklahoma

This city's Woodward Park is home to the most recent version of the statue Appeal to the Great Spirit by Cyrus Dallin. It's also home to Lake Yahola, which is located in Mohawk Park, adjacent to this city’s international airport. Also home to Shadow Mountain and Turkey Mountain, its tallest building is the 667-foot tall BOK Center Building, and its current mayor is Dewey Bartlett Jr. An incident between Sarah Paige and Dick Rowland in this city’s Drexel Building led to a disturbance in its Greenwood neighborhood. That event was a 1921 race riot that devastated this city. This city lies just west of its largest suburb Broken Arrow, on the Arkansas River. Its home to a school named for an evangelist, Oral Roberts University. FTP, name this city whose namesake university is known as the Golden Hurricane, the second largest city in the fine state of Oklahoma.

answer: Benjamin Henry ( Boneval ) {Latrobe}

A biography of this architect by Talbot Hamlin gives detailed descriptions of his early projects, such as the Hammerwood Lodge, which he designed as a hunting residence for John Sperling. The only other surviving domestic residence by him is the Ashdown House at Forest Row in Sussex. He studied under Samuel Cockerell and John Smeaton, the designer the Eddystone Lighthouse. He's associated with a city where he designed the Fairmount Water Works, though he left there to work on a cathedral with two turrets commissioned by John Carroll. In addition to that work, the Baltimore Basilica, he's well known for adapting the plans of William Thornton after being named Surveyor of Public Buildings in 1803. Upon resigning from that project, he was succeeded by Charles Bulfinch. FTP, give this namesake of a city in Pennsylvania, who worked on the U.S. Capitol, and is sometimes dubbed the "Father of American Architecture."
