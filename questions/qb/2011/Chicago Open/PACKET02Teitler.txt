This work’s second chapter includes an anecdote about historian U. B. Phillips’ desire to learn about the Fantyne people and a brief discussion of a journey of a coffle led by Mungo Park. Its chapter on certain survivals “in Secular Life” extensively quotes work on marriages, divorces and family structures reported in Hortense Powdermaker’s After Freedom. This work lays out its author’s position opposite E. F. Frazier in a debate over the extent of creolization. It takes aim at claims that the title people have a strong imitative faculty and naturally childlike character, and presents a number of “Africanisms” intended to debunk the notion that slaves brought no culture with them to the New World.

One character in this work enjoys reading The Wind in the Willows and Havelock Ellis, and has become an expert in mixing cocktails at age sixteen. Another character adopts the personae of a prominent ship-owner, an eminent novelist, and a retired burglar, and later claims to be the arsonist Sir Solomon Lucas-Dockery - but he's first seen as a flashy butler in the Welsh castle of Llanabba. The big wheel at Luna Park is used as an analogy for life by the architect Professor Otto Silenus, who redesigns the manor of King’s Thursday for the future Lady Metroland. The central character falls prey to the shenanigans of the Bollinger Club at Scone College and takes the hit for his fiancée Margot Beste-Chetwynde, who runs brothels in South America.

answer: {magnetic reconnection} (accept {flux transfer event} before it is mentioned)

This process is incorrectly predicted to occur slowly on a timescale proportional to the square root of the Lundquist number in the Sweet-Parker model. This process occurs approximately every eight minutes in the Earth’s magnetosphere, producing a portal through which solar wind enters in a flux transfer event. Kadomtsev proposed a cycle in which a tearing mode drives this process, producing sawtooth crashes in tokamaks. This process is preceded by the formation of a strong current sheet separating two regions threaded by anti-parallel fields, and it releases bursts of energy that are thought to generate auroras and solar flares. FTP, name this process of breaking and topologically rearranging magnetic field lines in a plasma.

answer: {Khnum}

This god was said to control the opening of twin caverns below his cult center that could release life-giving floods. He assisted the births of three future kings while pretending to be a servant to four goddesses disguised as dancing girls; one of those goddesses was his consort, the frog goddess Heket. Originally a god of the source of the Nile, he appears in the New Kingdom tale of the Two Brothers, where he fashions a beautiful woman to be the wife of Bata. He forms a triad with his consort Satet and their daughter Anuket; the three are depicted with Djoser at the top of the Famine Stele, which describes how Djoser ended a seven-year famine by rebuilding this god’s temple at his cult center in Elephantine. FTP, name this ram-headed Egyptian god credited with forming bodies on his potter’s wheel.

answer: {Congo} River

Some northern tributaries of this river include the Sangha and the Likouala aux Herbes, while the Fimi and the Kwa Rivers drain the water from Lake Mai Ndombe into this waterway. This river was a trade artery for peoples who used Bondongo-style ceramics, and organized families around the “etuka,” or hearth stone. Its easternmost navigable point is a city today called Kisangani, where this river ends at the Boyoma Falls. An early polity near its mouth was the Bungu kingdom, who crossed this river to the “hill of division” to found a larger kingdom that controlled trade near the Malebo Pool of this river, and converted to Christianity under Portuguese influence. FTP, name this river that flows between Kinshasa and Brazzaville.

answer: String Quartet {No.} 1 or String Quartet in e {minor} by {Bedrich Smetana} [or From {My Life}, or {Z mého života}]

Like its composer’s next work in its genre, this piece substitutes a 2-4 dance movement for the scherzo and contains a last movement that alternates between 6-8 and 2-4 time. In the first movement of this work, the recapitulation begins with the lyrical second theme of the exposition; the main theme of that movement, consisting of dramatic falling fifths and sixths, is quoted at the end of the last movement. The instruments are instructed to play “like a trumpet” in the polka section of this work’s second movement, for which actual trumpets are used in the orchestral transcription by George Szell. Antonin Dvorak was the violist in the first performance of this work, whose final movement opens with two folk tunes and fades away after the first violin plays a sustained high E to represent the onset of deafness. FTP, name this work by the composer of The Bartered Bride and Ma Vlast, a string quartet with an autobiographical title.

answer: {Rhodophyta} or {red} algae [prompt on “{Florideophyceae}” after (*); accept “{Florideophyceae}” before (*)]

One behavior commonly exhibited by these organisms involves injection of the nucleus of a conjunctor cell into the cytoplasm of a closely-related species and formation of a pustule on the host. Cell division in these organisms is incomplete and results in the formation of protein-containing plugs and pit connections between adjacent cells. One stage in their life cycle consists of a filamentous cystocarp protecting the diploid carposporophyte, which remains attached to the haploid gametophyte. These organisms notably lack flagellated cells in their life cycle, and have chloroplasts with unstacked thylakoids. They store carbohydrates in the cytoplasm in the form of (*) floridean starch, and deposit carrageenan and agar in their cell walls. FTP, name this group of algae that produces phycobilins like phycoerythrin, which gives its members their characteristic color.

answer: {Raymond} Henry {Williams}

This thinker focused on Somerset Maugham’s condescending description of Thomas Hardy in the essay “Love and Work,” which critiques Hardy’s erudite language in Tess of the D’Urbervilles. This critic argues that determination must be understood in a temporal context in his essay that seeks to redefine base and superstructure. He claims that modernity led to the “myth functioning as a memory” of rural places as exemplars of a lost golden age. This author of The Country and the City also wrote a treatise on television that terms a network’s attempt to keep its viewers watching from program-to-program as “flow.” An appendix to his seminal critical work Culture and Society spawned a slimmer study of the etymology, history, and use of words like “Art,” “Culture,” and “Nature.” FTP, name this Marxist literary critic who wrote Keywords, who was born in Wales.

A variant of this experiment that successively introduces quarter wave plates and a diagonal polarizer and utilizes a pair of entangled particles is known as the quantum eraser, which was inspired by a variant proposed by John Wheeler that is known as the delayed-choice experiment. Another variant of this experiment confirmed Born’s rule that the probability density never contains high-order interference terms.

answer: {shirk} [or {sirk}]

Muhammad al-Wahhab, the founder of Wahhabism, wrote a treatise on the “Four Foundations” of this concept. The Rububiyah form of this concept is divided into categories of association and negation. Those who oppose Tawassul cite the fact that dua directed to the dead constitutes the al-‘Ibada form of this concept. The word for this action, which is divided into “greater” and “lesser” forms, comes from the Arabic root for “to share.” The Al-Asmaa Was-Sifaat form of this practice is the root of Islam’s general prohibition of religious icons. The term for this practice is contrasted with tawhid. It applies to mushrikun and it is the only sin that Allah cannot pardon. FTP, name this sin in Islam exemplified by idolatry and polytheism, the worship of any entity other than Allah.
