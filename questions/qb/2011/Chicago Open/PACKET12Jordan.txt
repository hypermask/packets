The title character sends everyone home after a character laughs for the benefit of Mr. and Mrs. Gobineau. A voice from offstage interrupts a song about a black swan that's accompanied by an onstage tambourine. Two different characters sing the chromatically descending phrase “Mother, mother, are you there?” in this work, which also includes “Monica’s Waltz.” The title character ends this opera by “hoarsely whispering” “Was it you?” after drunkenly shooting Toby. She reveals her “frauds” to her customers, only to have them argue that her services are real. FTP, name this two-act opera about Madame Flora, the title spiritualist, which was composed by Gian Carlo Menotti.

answer: {Fields} [accept "{p}-{adic numbers}" before "{valuation}"]

Ax and Kochen name an isomorphism theorem between two of these objects. A valuation is defined over one of these structures, and these structures necessarily have a Krull dimension of zero. Adjoining a primitive root of unity to the rational numbers gives a cyclotomic one of these, while these are called "splitting" if a polynomial factors completely over them. All of these with finite order have order equal to the power of some prime, and are isomorphic to each other. Vector spaces must be equipped with one of these, and Galois theory describes how their extension correspond to permutation groups. FTP, name these mathematical structure equiped with addition, multiplication, and division.

answer: Imogen 

In one scene, this character tells another to get lost, saying he should "breathe not where princes are.” She claims that "against self-slaughter, there is a prohibition so divine, that craven's my weak hand," after she opens her first scene by exclaiming "Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant can tickle where she wounds!" She requests that another character kill her after arriving at Milford-Haven, and later attempts to take some medicine that turns out to be the drug prepared by the doctor Cornelius and given to Pisanio. That event occurs after she introduces herself as “Fidele” while staying in a cave with Polydore and Cadwal, who are actually her brothers Guiderius and Arviragus. Her bracelet is stolen by Iachimo to try to prove her infidelity to her husband Posthumus. FTP, name this Shakespearean heroine, who is the daughter of Cymbeline.

answer: Ahmed {Sekou Touré} (or {Segou Touré} )

This ruler established a national currency called the sily, or "elephant", which created financial chaos, and he rose to power on the motto "we prefer poverty in liberty to riches in slavery." His overthrow was the goal of Operation Green Sea, after he'd set up a one-party state under the PDG, a wing of the African Democratic Rally. This author of the collection "Militant Poems" gained infamy for using Camp Boiro National Guard Barracks as a political prison, executing over 50,000 people, sparking a naval attack on his capital by Portuguese troops in 1970. His name was shared by his great grandfather Samori, who fought the Mandingo Wars against the French in the 1880s. He granted asylum to Stokely Carmichael, who adopted his name in tribute, and also provided a haven for Kwame Nkrumah.

answer: {The Tempest} (or {La Tempesta} )

This painting may have gained its name from a quote by Leonardo Loredon - that theory is supported by a faint emblem of the Carrara family which appears on a tower in the background, which supports the idea that the canvas may allude to the recent Battle of Agnadello. A small white stork perches on the roof of one of a line of buildings in the background. Commissioned by Gabriel Vendramin, it is often dated between its artist's Castelfranco Madonna and his Three Philosophers. The bottom left shows a man dressed in red with stockings up to his knee, holding a halberd in his right hand. Between the two adults lies a small body of water, spanned in the background by a four-pillared bridge. The underpainting shows that the man was originally a nude bathing woman.

answer: {The Merchant’s Tale}

Tory Pearman wrote about “pregnancy and the disabled female body” in this literary work. In one section, generosity gets contrasted with a tyrant "who has a heart as heard as any stone," who might let a man die in that place "rather than have granted him her grace." A few key events see one character make a wax impression of a key, and another character write a letter which he pins in a silk purse that he strings up near his heart. In another part, Justinus uses a quote from Seneca to argue against Placebo as to what the main character should do. The other main character asks for help to pick some pears from a pear tree, after which Pluto restores the sight of an old man who'd been blinded mentally and physically. Ultimately, Proserpina grants May the ability to deceive January into thinking she was just wrestling with Damyan. FTP, name this Canterbury Tale told by a “rude man” of commerce.

answer: {Sandmeyer} Reaction

Evans used this reaction to add chlorinate ring two in his synthesis of teicoplanin aglycone. This reaction was once though to proceed via ion exchange, but Waters and Kochi proposed a radical method for ligand exchange. One reaction formylating benzene can use a reagent similar to one used in this reaction in place of a more typical aluminum chloride catalyst to proceed at atmospheric pressure; that reaction is named for Gattermann and is sometimes conflated with this reaction. A similar reaction that proceeds photochemically results in flourination and is named for Balz and Schiemann. The first step of this reaction requires the application of nitrous acid in acidic conditions, producting an N-nitrosamine, which rearranges and is replaced by a ligand donated from copper. FTP, name this reaction in which copper I catalyzes the substitution of an aromatic amino group using a diazonium salt.
