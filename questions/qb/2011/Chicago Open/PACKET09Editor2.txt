On the left of one of these works, a woman sits with a wooden plank on her lap and a line of 24 people to her right who all hold onto a rope - above that woman, Concordia, is a red angel who gives out punishments while a white angel gives out rewards. Those two angels stand on a scale whose fulcrum is a seated figure representing Justice. These works were commissioned by the Noveschi family for the Sala della Pace, a room located in the Palazzo Pubblico, where these pieces decorate three walls. One part shows a harpy named "Timor" floating over a city gate, while in another part, that harpy is replaced with the figure of "Securitas." These works show the Council of the Sienese Republic, and alternately depict life in the city and the countryside.

answer: {Calculus} of {Variations} [accept word forms]

The fundamental lemma of this theory used to transform problems from weak to strong formulations states that a certain zero functional is a convolution with the zero function. Another simplifying lemma shows that a time independent Lagrangian corresponds to a conserved energy; that identity is named for Beltrami. The Douglas integral can be used to solve a problem in this theory inspired by soap films. The central equation of this theory reduces to Lagrange's equations of motion in the limit of finitely many degrees of freedom, corresponds to seeking the stationary points of a generalized action. In additional to an early justification of Snell's Law later fashioned into Fermat's principle, problems in this branch of mathematics include showing that the cycloid solves the Brachristochrone problem. FTP, name this branch of mathematics that seeks to extremize a functional.

During one portion of this novel, several characters search for pebbles in the shape of bird's tongues and chick-peas on the beach - such pebbles are known as snake eyes, as they can cure the village sickness. A character collects a thousand "wills of the dying" in a phial, which he plans to use to build a globe - he also desires to fly in a machine made of steel and cane, fueled by human will. The main characters have the nicknames Seven-Suns and Seven-Moons, and are often visited by Domenico Scarlatti, who plays sweet music for them which bolsters the clairvoyant ability of the title female, who can "see into bodies." The two title characters earn their bread by constructing the convent at Mafra, which is built to redeem a pledge to God by King John V. FTP, name this romance set during the Inquisition in 18th century Portugal and titled for two lovers, a novel written by Jose Saramago.

answer: Paul Felix {Lazarsfeld}

This thinker points out that people only provide justifications they believe will promote understanding of their viewpoint in his 1935 article "The Art of Asking Why," in which he puts forth his "reason analysis." He wrote a work which followed eight thousand people in 1940 in Erie County, Ohio, concluding that the views of most political voters are not converted by the media, only reinforced by the media. He postulated that ideas flow from media to opinion leaders to the rest of the population, in his “two step flow of communication." In a 1947 study, along with Robert Merton, he coined the term “narcotizing dysfunction,” though he was criticized by C. Wright Mills for his "abstracted empiricism." FTP, name this author of The People’s Choice and Personal Influence, who is called the “founder of modern empirical sociology.”

answer: {Fluorine}

A 2002 paper by Gu, Peng, Harge, Smalley, and Margrave described the addition of atoms of this element to carbon nanotubes followed by pyrolysis of the nanotubes in order to cut them into roughly fifty nm lengths. An isotope of this element is used in a namesake form of NMR due to its lack of a nuclear Overhauser effect and high magnetogyric ratio, while the Gauche effect can be seen in compounds with two of this element attached to adjacent carbons. This element is found in the molten flux used in the Hall-Heroult process, cryolite. Perhaps the best known compound of this element is created by reacting chloroform with molecules of this element bonded to tin and hydrogen, then mixing the result with steam at nine hundred and fifty degrees Celsius to eliminate the hydrochloric acid. FTP, name this element which is found in Teflon.

answer: Charles {Babbage}

This man wrote a ballet in which 60 white nymphs perform the Rainbow Dance, so named because different colored lights are focused on them - that ballet Alethes and Iris was never produced because the theater manager was convinced it would cause a fire. He invented the first cow catcher and campaigned for passage of an act against "street nuisances" like outdoor musicians, who he claimed wasted a quarter of his life. He responded to William Whewell's statement that no scientific explanation of the universe was possible in his "Ninth Bridgewater Treatise," which attacked the eight previous treatises funded by the Earl of Bridgewater. He also wrote about the influence of aristocrats on science in his Reflections on the Decline of Science in England . This author of the memoir Passages From the Life of a Philosopher improved on Jacquard's invention of punched cards by proposing a device which incorporated an input, storage system, processor, control unit, and output device.

answer: {Neutrino}

One hypothesized variety of these particles with a an X charge of five was proposed to explain the results of the LSND experiment, while Bahcall and Pinsonneault described several models for creating these particles. One property of these particles can be explained by positing both a Dirac and a Majorana term, and then noting that the left handed and right handed eigenstates can end up with widely different values. Wolfenstein noted the effects of forward scattering on processes involving these particles like neutral current-caused flavor changing, leading to MSW effect. One variety of this particle was discovered after the emission of pi-mesons in an experiment run by Lederman, Schwartz, and Steinberger, each variety's interconversion is explained by their flavor oscillation. FTP, name this lepton, which comes in electron, muon, and tau varieties.
