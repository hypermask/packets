answer: {Seoul} ( architecture , monuments )

For a time, this city's finances were controlled by an Irish customs official John McLeavy Brown, who worked under Robert Hart, and designed the gardens in Tapgol Park. That park was the planned location for the Manse Demonstrations, which sought independence as part of an action known as the May First Movement. This city is home to the Moonlight Rainbow Fountain, installed as part of a Renaissance Project spanning the Banpo Bridge as the world's largest bridge fountain. The "63 Building" here, named for its number of floors, contains an aquarium where you can pet the fish. It's also home to the theme park Lotte World, and the "Five Grand Palaces," which include the Hall of Prospering Virtue and the statues of Sejong the Great. FTP, name this city on the Han River, which is the capital and largest city of South Korea.

answer: {Magnetoresistance} [accept " {Giant Magnetoresistane} " or " {Tunnel Magnetoresistance} " before "the simplest form "]

Thermal assisted switching and spin torque transfer are two applications of this phenomenon. Half-metals exhibit a strong form of this effect due to vanishing spin down density. Microwaves tuned to the cyclotron harmonics of two dimensional electron gases can cause unusually strong oscillations in this phenomenon, One form of this phenomenon takes place between two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer, and is central to the field of spintronics, such as in hard disk read heads. The simplest form of this phenomenon is anisotropic and is proportional to one plus quantity mu B squared. FTPE, name this phenonomenon in which an applied B field changes the conductivity of a metal.

answer: {Carmen Fantasy} [accept reasonable equivalents like “{fantasies} on {themes} from {Carmen}”, since the {exact titles differ}; prompt on “{concerto}({s})” before read; prompt on things like “{concerto} for ({double}) {bass}” until “{clarinet}”]

One work of this type by Frank Proto uses the aria “I say that nothing can frighten me” in its slow movement, and begins with a cadenza that calls for parallel unison double stops on the bass. Besides that 1991 work, other recent ones include a clarinet solo by Simon Milton. In a work of this type for jazz band, a solo trumpet plays variations on an intermezzo, but these works are more often scored as concertos. In a “brilliant” one of these by François Borne, the soloist’s first entrance is with the melody of “Mais ne me quitte pas” from Act IV of the namesake work. The one by Franz Waxman was written for a film called “Humoresque,” and is often played on viola. A more famous violin work of this type features a high-register repetition of the “Aragonaise,” - that work is by Sarasate. FTP, name these virtuoso showpieces, most of which include some variations on a Habanera.

answer: Zora Neale {Hurston}

In an introduction to one work, this anthropologist tells "The Tale of the Soul-Stealing Jew" and discusses the "art people create before they find out that there is such a thing as art," referring to primitive stories told in reaction to the natural world. This social scientist famously coined the term "the spy glass of anthropology" to refer to the idea of seeing oneself as somebody else, and analyzed the dancers of Polk County in one work. That work features a study of Marie Leveau, as well as four other hoodoo doctors whose beliefs on healing potions and conjuring are studied. Stories about the citizens of Eatonville are also discussed, while another ethnography by this writer discusses the Maroons of Jamaica, and is entitled Tell My Horse. FTP, name this student of Frans Boas who wrote the text Mules and Men, and was a Florida-born author of some fiction like Seraph on the Suwanee.

answer: {Yemen}

During the late middle ages, this nation was ruled by the Rasulid dynasty, while earlier it had been ruled from the capital of Timna by the kingdom of Qataban. The northern portion of this country was ruled by the Mutawakkilite Kingdom, until it was overthrown by the revolt of Abdullah as-Sallal who established a republic in this country after sacking its royal palace at Ta’iz. During ancient times, it was governed from the capital of Ma’rib by an empire that fought several civil wars with the Hadramaut kingdom in this nation. That empire, the Sabaean empire, dominated this area until supplanted by the Himyarites. Known generally by the Romans as “Arabia Felix,” FTP, name this republic on the northern shore of the Gulf of Aden, which is bordered by Saudi Arabia and Oman.

The vibrational bands of pyrene fluorescence in different environments is a common tool for studying these structures. The log of the critical concentration of these structures is related to the number of methylene monomers in an equation named for Stauff and Klevens; that point occurs when the surface of a fluid is completely covered so that any additional chemical must form these structures. These structures cannot form below the Krafft temperature. Cholic acid promotes the formation of these structures necessary for emulsifying lipids, while inorganic examples of these structures commonly consist of sulfobetaines and zwitterions. FTP, name these structures whose formation is driven by hydrophobicity, collections of surfactants with a hydrophilic exterior and hydrophobic interior.

answer: {Zazie} in the {Metro} ({Zazie Dans} le {Metro})

One character in this work introduces himself as Pedro-Surplus and is accused of stealing some blue jeans. He later uses the name Haroun al Rations and launches into a speech, but he's interrupted by the phrase "talk, talk, that's all you can do," - a recurring joke because it's the only line spoken by the parrot Laverdure. This book was translated by Barbara Wright, along with its author's other works like The Blue Flowers and Exercises in Style. At the Mount of Venus, the "Dying Swan" is performed by Gabriel, a ballerina dressed in drag whose homosexuality is repeatedly questioned. He's also the uncle of the title character, who falls asleep just as she's about to fulfill her dream to see the title attraction.

A story about this creature says that it was once captured by a king, but it refused to sing for three years because it was without a mate - the king tried to solve its loneliness by setting a mirror next to it, but that only caused this creature to die. Another story says it was once sought out by many similar creatures, who journeyed through several valleys until only thirty of them remained, at which point they realized that this creature was just a reflection of themself in the water. In another tale, this creature instructs her student to break a branch off a tamarisk tree and create an arrow, which is to be aimed at the forehead of Isfandiyar. This creature becomes the nurse of Zal after he's abandoned on Mount Elburz by his father Sam, and she grants Zal three feathers to call on her in his time of need. Sometimes said to reside within the sacred plant Haoma, or the Tree of Life, FTP, name this great bird who appears in Persian mythology.

One man in American history with this last name was a reverend who authored travel books like From the Lakes of Kularney to the Golden Horn, but is best remembered as the longtime editor of The Evangelist, a New York-based periodical. Another man with this last name was counsel for Jay Gould and James Fisk during the Erie Railroad cases in 1869 and defended Boss Tweed, but is more famous for creating a namesake code of civil procedure in 1848 in New York to unify legal knowledge. That man's brother was a Supreme Court justice who issued dissents in Munn v. Illinois and the Slaughterhouse Cases defending liberty of contract - he'd been appointed to the Court by Abraham Lincoln after having been Chief Justice in California. Yet another fellow by this surname was a financier who funded the artistic expeditions of Frederic Church. FTP, give the name shared by four brothers, one of whom was the father of the transatlantic cable, and went by the first name Cyrus.

In one poem by this writer, a man exclaims "Here's one old landmark gone, For old man Tyson's dead" and spells Tyson's name repeatedly. Late in life, he published a series of war correspondences called Happy Dispatches. Another of his poems begins "there was movement at the station for the word has passed around that the cold from old Regret had got away." A story by this author tells the tale of Henry, who sees a large track in the road and wonders what car made it, and how much horsepower it had, but he's told that it had "Three Elephant Power." This writer sent a letter to Thomas Gerald Clancy which led to his poem "Clancy of the Overflow," and that same figure recurs in his poem "The Man From Snowy River." FTP, name this poet who created a national anthem with his "Waltzing Matilda," and is one of the best known bush poets of Australia.

answer: {Random Walk}

RDFs describe this process in two-state systems common in biology. Watson's triple integrals appear in Polya's treatment of the level crossing phenomenon of this process in higher dimensions.  The Skorokhod embedding thoerem relates this process to its continuous limit. The Hurst exponent describes the self-correlation in this process. Levy names a type of this process where lengths are distributed according to an inverse power law. The excluded volume condition is added to use this process to model polymer physics. In one dimension, the variance is proportional to the square root of n, while in one and two dimensions the return probability is one.  Black Scholes uses this system to model stock prices, and in the limit of continous variation this becomes a Weiner process. Typically modeled as a markov process, FTP, name this process similar to Brownian motion in which an actor takes steps.

answer: {Belgium}

One artist from this country shows a red-haired woman staring at the viewer in his canvas I Lock The Door Upon Myself, which he hung in his self-created villa that he dubbed the "Temple of the Self." That artist showed a leopard with a female head crouching on rock pressing its head against the head of a half naked man in his painting The Caresses. Another artist of this nation showed his sister seated at a table loaded with flowers and wine bottles - the rejection of that canvas, The Oyster-Eater, sparked the formation of an artistic group in this country backed by Octave Maus. That group included the aforementioned Fernand Khnopff and took its name from the number of artists invited each year to exhibitions. That group, "The Twenty," later turned on its native son and refused to depict his canvas showing a Colman's mustard sign and the banner "Vive Le Sociale." FTP, name this home to the painter of Christ's Entry into Bruseels, as well as the painter of The Treachery of Images and The Son of Man.

answer: Robert {Lucas}

In one article, this economist wrote that the task ahead was to "write a FORTRAN program" that accepts economic policy rules as inputs and generates output statistics on the operating characteristics of time series. In a 1969 study with Leonard Rapping, he explained the low employment levels during the Great Depression as resulting from the elasticity of labor supply within the business cycle. In his paper "On the Mechanics of Economic Development," he introduced the idea of human capital into the production function to create an endogenous growth model with Hirofumi Uzawa. He wrote about the "neutrality of money," which is maintained with predictable inflation, in an article outlining his "islands model." The idea that normal Keynesian models cannot accurately analyze how changes in monetary policy will affect the economy is known as this man's critique, while his paradox concerns flow of capital to developing nations.. FTP, name this economist of the Chicago School who extended John Muth's theory of rational expectations.

answer: {Sejm} (prompt "{Polish parliament} / {diet}" or anything like that)

This body was given power over all new laws and taxes by the "Nihil Novi Constitution," which proclaimed that "nothing new" could be passed without this body's approval. Any member of this body held the "liberum veto" which gave them unlimited power to object, up until the passing of the May Constitution. One meeting of this body was presided over by Nicholas Repnin, and occurred fifty years after the so-called "silent" one in 1717. The szlachta class composed the majority of its Chamber of Deputies. A newly elected monarch was forced to call this body and agree to the Pacta Conventa prior to taking power. Its size increased after the Union of Lublin, since it accepted deputies from Lithuania after that merger. FTP, name this three-estate body which served as the entire Polish parliament prior to 1918.

One neoplasm of these cells produces Pautrier abscesses, and they are laden with mucopolysaccharides in Sezary syndrome. So-called gamma-delta ones are considered immature, and besides Mycosis fungoides, another cancer of these cells is caused by infection with the HTLV virus. Their expression of the CD28 marker allows them to be activated by CD80 and CD86. One subpopulation of them differentiates under the control of FoxP3. Tacrolimus inhibits the release of interleukin-2 from these cells, which trigger aggregation of phagocytes into granulomas during certain infections. Another type of them secretes perforin and granzyme to destroy virus-infected cells; that subclass expresses CD8. Most populations of these cells express CD3, and they can be differentiated by their expression of CD4 and CD8. These cells develop in the bone marrow, but mature in the thymus, where they undergo clonal selection. FTP, name these lymphocytes which are divided into regulatory, cytotoxic, and helper varieties.
