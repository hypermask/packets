answer: {Australia}

A 1971 film set in this nation begins with a father taking his teenage daughter and young son out for a picnic - he then begins firing a pistol at them, and when they run away, he torches his car and shoots himself. That film had five minutes cut from its American release since its female lead, Jenny Agutter, was 16 while shown swimming nude. A 1975 film set here sees four girls go missing - Emily is found a week later, unable to recall anything that happened, except that Miss McCraw walked away in her underwear. The director of that film, a native of this country, also created a film in which the amateur sprinters Archy and Frank enlist in this nation’s army, though the former gets killed running toward German machine-gun nests at the title battle. FTP, name this country which provided the setting for Picnic at Hanging Rock and Walkabout, as well as the Peter Weir film Gallipoli.

answer: Beta-oxidation

Reye’s syndrome can be caused by 3-mercaptoproprionic acid inhibiting an enzyme in this process, and a mutation in PCCA or PCCB inhibits one stage in this process. Another mutation affecting the transport of substrates for this process characteristically causes hypoketotic hypoglycemia, while another causes the buildup of dicarboxylic acids. Another defect in transport of substrates for this process is treated with Lorenzo’s oil and is called adreno-leuko-dystrophy. It uses one molecule of both FAD and NAD per turn, and its final step per turn is catalyzed by beta-ketothiolase. The carnitine shuttle is used to transport substrates for this process, which takes place both in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Substrates with an odd number of carbons produce propionyl-CoA at the end of this process, which produces acetyl-CoA molecules from substrates like palmitate. FTP, name this process which breaks down fatty acids, and gets its name from the fact that it adds oxygen to the second carbon from the end.

answer: The {Winter’s Tale}

Act IV of this play sees a king argue that art is needed to “mend nature,” an aesthetic position his daughter rejects by stating that “were [she] painted” with make-up, she wouldn’t want her prince to choose her to “breed by” for that reason. A dispute between the shepherdesses Mopsa and Dorcas leads a clown to exclaim “Is there no manners left among maids?” That dispute is partly based on the shepherdesses’ desire to publish some ballads, one of which is advertised as "very true, and but a month old." The line “You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely” is uttered by the king's counselor Camillo. The work contains an erroneous reference to the "seacoast of Bohemia," and sees Antigonus leaves a bag of gold with the princess, before we hear the stage direction “Exit, pursued by a bear.” FTP, name this play in which Leontes is reunited with his wife Hermione and daughter Perdita.

answer: {Fibonacci Heap} [prompt on " {heap} " before mention]

During the decrease key step of this data structure, nodes are marked if their child is moved. A "soft" data structure with a faster delete than this structure's was developed by Chazelle but relied upon corruption, while other attempts to improve this structure's large time constant resulted in "skew" and "pairing"varieties. A certain potential function associated with this data structure is equal to the number of roots plus twice the number of marked nodes, ensuring descrease-key and a lazy union each run in amortized constant time. The max degree can be bounded by a log base phi of the total number of nodes. This structure can be used to implement a priorty queue, such as commonly used in Prim's and Djikstra's algorithm.

answer: {bricolage} (or {bricoleur} is {fine} )

In Interrogating the Real, Slavoj Zizek argues that Foucault’s treatment of the sex act could be described as utilizing this process, since he analyzed sex as an “artificial unification of heterogeneous desires.” In their Anti-Oedipus, Deleuze and Guattari illustrate this process with reference to Richard Lindner’s painting Boy with Machine. Derrida argues that if this practice is truly the “necessity of borrowing one’s concepts from the texts of a heritage...it must be said that all discourse” could be partaking of this process. The formulator of this concept presented it in a work which analyzed the marriage rituals of the Aranda and the Arabanna, two indigenous Australian groups. That formulator contrasted this process with the one engaged in by "the engineer," since the figure who engages in this process works with a closed set of instruments.

answer: Battle of {Thermopylae}

In Books 4 and 7 of his Guide to Greece, Pausanias describes how no soldiers from the Peloponnesus took part in a battle at this site, resulting in one side being outnumbered by over four to one. The tide turned when the enemy divided forces and the general Acichorios marched into Aetolia to sack the city of Callium. The opening salvos saw the Greeks burn bridges over the Spercheios River, which the enemy nevertheless forded. Loss was sealed when the Greeks under Callippus were flanked by a detachment led by Brennus using a familiar path over Mount Oeta. That battle led to an attack on Delphi by the Gauls in 279 BC, while another battle here saw Antiochus III lose to the Romans under Manius Glabrio in 191 BC. Still another battle here happened simultaneously with the naval Battle of Artemisium, and saw the "Immortals" commanded by Hydarnes. FTP, name this site where Leonidas made his stand against Xerxes and the Persians in 480 BC.

Charette's reaction enantioselectively prepares chiral compounds of this type from allylic alcohols using the ligand dioxaborolane. One reaction creating this group requires a namesake reagent which was been variously synthesized by Emschwiller, Wittig, who used diazomethane, and Furukawa, who used an alkyl-exchange reaction involving an 1,1-di-halo-alkane. That reaction produces norcarane when the starting material is cyclohexene, and uses a copper zinc couple to add a carbene to an alkene. The bonds in this molecule can be described with sp two hybridization according to Walsh. This product of the Simmons-Smith Reaction was first predicted by Baeyer to be characterized by a high angle strain. FTP, name this cyclic alkane consisting of three carbon atoms.

Jacques Derrida, in his essay “Le Parole Soufflee,” writes that this poet had “exemplary access to the essence of schizophrenia in general.” One of his poems claims that what God wants most “is that the established word be/Carefully attended,” and exhorts his nation’s poetry to “accord with this.” That poem begins “The god/Is near and hard to grasp” and imagines the epiphany of the Book of Revelations to John. In another poem, this author wonders “who wants poets at all in lean years,” a line which prompted the essay “What Are Poets For?” by Heidegger. Along with “Patmos," he wrote a verse tragedy in which the title philosopher sees himself as a man of purity in a world of men who have lost connection to nature. This author of the elegy "Bread and Wine" described that man's suicide by volcano in The Death of Empedocles, which was left unfinished, just like his novel Hyperion.

answer: “{Apology} for {Raymond Sebond}” (prompt the {Essays} of {Montaigne})

This work’s author uses the fact that wine can taste differently in the mouth of a sick man than it does in the mouth of a well man to contend that differing perceptions cannot both be true in a determinate reality. Later in this work, the author compares building up knowledge from first principles to the building of a house, using the sight of a dagger to represent knowledge of perception, and the idea that the dagger has ripped a couch to build to the highest level of knowledge, causal interactions. The subject of this work wrote that God had given man two books: the Bible and a metaphorical book of animals, Nature itself. This work was inspired by its author's reading of the tract Natural Theology or the Book of Creatures, written by the title Spanish theologian. This work contains its author's dictum "What do I know?" and was included in a collection featuring other pieces like “Of Physiognomy” and “Of Cannibals.” FTP, name this essay, the longest and best known one by Montaigne.
