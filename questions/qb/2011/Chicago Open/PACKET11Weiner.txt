In one scene in this novel, the protagonist hitches a ride with a flue salesman, who claims that love is the secret to good salesmanship, but admits that he thanks God when his customers’ family members die so he doesn’t have to remember their names. Near the end, the protagonist hitches a ride again, this time with a man in a lavender shirt in a lavender car, who drugs and rapes him. An unseen character in this novel is Bernice, the social worker ex-wife of a character who wears a hearing aid due to damage suffered when Mason shot at him. The protagonist spends the novel trying to avoid baptizing Bishop, the mentally challenged son of his uncle, Rayber, after failing to bury his great-uncle.

answer: {Fischer-Tropsch} process [accept either name]

The most widely accepted mechanism for this reaction involves the formation of sigma-vinyl species via the reaction of methylene and methyne groups, and a distinct double bond shift is observed when using cobalt catalysts for this reaction. The ratio of weight fraction of the products of this reaction to an atom number decreases almost log-linearly, and that relationship, which is not obeyed by the small products, is called the SF distribution. The water-gas shift reaction may be used to bring the ratios of the reactants of this process to ideal levels. Using nickel and ruthenium catalysts at low pressures yields methane in this process. FTP, identify this process by which a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen is converted into liquid hydrocarbons, and is named for two German chemists.

answer: “{History Will Absolve} Me” [or “La {Historia} Me {Absolverá}”]

This speech condemns those who "prostate themselves before the master of the moment until they grind their foreheads into the ground." It praises, in descending numerical order, seven hundred thousand unemployed, five hundred thousand farmhands, thirty thousand teachers, and ten thousand graduates of professional schools. It was delivered from memory over the course of five hours. The speaker responds to “those who call me a dreamer” by invoking the "apostle of independence," and condemns a thirty percent illiteracy rate. This speech mounts a defense for the actions at the Moncada base that inspired the 26th of July movement, but never mentions the name of “the miserable tyrant who took the lives of seventy of my comrades," Bautista. It ends with the title phrase, which comes after "Condemn me. It does not matter." FTP, name this speech which concluded the defendant’s case on behalf of himself in the 1953 trial of Fidel Castro.

answer: John Emerich {Edward Dalberg-Acton} , 1st Baron Acton

In one work, this man claims that “it is bad to be oppressed by a minority, but it is worse to be oppressed by a majority” in showing how absolutism can come about even in a democracy. This author of “The History of Freedom in Antiquity” succeeded Cardinal Newman as editor of The Rambler. He coordinated the editing of the first Cambridge Modern History. He sided with his instructor Johann Dollinger against papal infallibility. His most famous argument appears in a letter in which he defends criticism of authority because “the person who authorizes the act shares the guilt of the person who commits it” and rejects the idea that “we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men.” This thinker wrote that letter to Archbishop Mandell Creighton, who'd recently defended Popes Alexander VI and Sixtus IV. FTP, name this British historian and thinker who claimed that “Absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

answer: {Adler} (Felix {Adler}, Mortimer {Adler}, {Alfred Adler})

One thinker with this last name espoused his motto in the publication Creed and Deed. That man founded the Society for Ethical Culture movement in New York City, where he set up the first free kindergarten. Oddly, that Jewish doctor shares his name with the so-called “King of Clowns” who headed Ringling Brother’s circus starting in the 1920s. Another man with this last name wrote that freedom exists in three types – self realization, self perfection, and self-determination – in his book The Idea of Freedom. He also established the Paideia Proposal which suggests that children acquire three different types of knowledge, the last of which is the acquisition of values, which must be taught by the Socratic method. That man also wrote How To Think About God and was the founder of the Great Books movement. FTP, give the last name shared by Felix, Mortimer, and a certain psychologist who coined the idea of the inferiority complex.

In one of these works, the speaker advocates finding “Sandals more interwoven and complete / To fit the naked foot of poesy." Another one of these tells its addressee that “thy great name alone / Is a full harvest whence to reap high feeling." That poem is entitled “To Kosciusko." In one of these, the speaker imagines watching the waves and the moon like “nature’s, patient Eremite”. Another one ends with the speaker standing alone on the shore of the world and thinking until “love and fame to nothingness do sink”. The speaker of another describes feeling “like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes / He star’d at the Pacific” in reaction to reading another poet’s translations. Those poems are “When I have fears," “Bright star, were I steadfast as thou," and “On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer”. FTP, name these fourteen-line works by the poet of “Ode on a Grecian Urn”.

answer: ancient {Athenian prostitutes} [or {courtesans} or any other synonym or euphemism for “{prostitute}”]

Some of these people wore shoes with the word “akolouthi” in relief on the soles in order to leave imprints on the sand. A different class of this people is commonly named for their ability to play the flute. The allegation that Timarkhos was once one of these people was made in Aeschines' speech “Against Timarkhos," since none of these had ever been permitted to hold political office. Another famous one was the Phaedo of Platonic dialogue fame. They included among their ranks a rival of Lais, who was part of a class of these known as the “hetaera." That one became the model for Aphrodite of Cnidus after enchanting Praxiteles, and won acquittal for an impiety charge by showing the jurors her breasts. Besides Phryne, this group of people was alleged to include Aspasia, and was known for working on the street as “pornai.” FTP, name this kind of person who would accept drachmas in exchange for sex.

answer: Karl {Weierstrass}

Along with an Italian mathematician, this man names a result stating that a meromorphic function approaches arbitrarily close to any complex value in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a singularity of the function. A factorization theorem named for him guarantees the existence of an entire, non-zero polynomial with zeros at a given set of points with defined order for those points, and he developed a result by Ferdinand Lindemann and proved that for a set of distinct algebraic numbers, the exponentials of those numbers are linearly independent. His namesake function is continuous everywhere but nowhere differentiable, while another result partly named for his is a special case of the Heine-Borel theorem. FTP, identify this mathematician who co-names a theorem stating that each bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence along with Bernard Bolzano.

One speech about these people quotes Omar Khayyam to claim that "we are only impotent pieces" and declares "he was not his own father, he was not his own mother." One of these people was a leading authority on Kirtland's warbler and kept three thousand preserved birds in his study; that one claimed to have dropped a certain object while running to take a picture of a Wilson's phalarope and used the pseudonym “George Johnson” in a letter to a pawnbroker. The chief result of their action was popularly derided as “the battle of the alienists” and became inevitable after a distinctive pair of glasses was found in a marsh.

The addition of this structure by the Hce and Hcm proteins induces a lag in a process that is otherwise inhibited by DRB in the presence of DSIF. This structure is found with different chemical modifications on snurps U1, U2, U4, and U5 but not on U6. Two molecules downstream from it are often O-methylated in higher organisms. An enzyme from the vaccinia virus which has phosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and methyltransferase activities is used in assays to add this structure, which confers stability from exonuclease degredation. eIF4F binding to this structure helps recruit small ribosomal subunit to initiate a certain process, and it has an unusual 5' - 5' linkage and contains a guanine that is methylated at the 7-position. FTP, identify this structure which, like the poly-A tail is a modification found on eukaryotic messenger RNAs.

In one work, this thinker imagines a world that seeks to bring back scientific knowledge after scientists, blamed for a major cataclysm, are lynched wholesale. He used the example of a child who is given candy to learn to play chess, but later enjoys it on its own merits, to distinguish between the “internal” and “external” goods that can be attained within a “practice.” This author of Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry called modern politics “civil war carried on by other means,” since politicians cannot agree on basic moral premises. He advocated a return to the Greek polis, where citizens agreed on what constituted the good life. This author of Whose Justice? Which Rationality? wrote his best-known work about the Enlightenment stripping moral discourse of its meaning. FTP, name this modern Thomistic and Aristotelian philosopher, who wrote After Virtue.

A smaller variant of this instrument is the “tarole”, which is employed in Varèse’s Ionisation. The Adagio non troppo section of the first movement of Nielsen’s Fifth Symphony contains a separate, much faster metronome marking for this instrument, including instructions to “play as though determined at all costs to obstruct the music” during its cadenza. Its part is so prominent in Nielsen’s clarinet concerto that the piano reduction includes a third part for a player of this instrument. Among the forty “rudiments” that form the basis of this instrument’s technique are the “drag,” “flam,” and “paradiddle.” This instrument opens and closes the “Game of Pairs” movement of Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra, and begins the Thieving Magpie overture with three rolls. FTP, name this percussion instrument also known as a “military drum,” which is commonly used for a rim shot and introduces the ostinato in Ravel’s Bolero.
