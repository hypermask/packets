answer: {Enlil} [or {Ellil}]

In one story, this god struck the uzu-e, the “bringer forth of flesh”, with a mattock, which he had recently invented. Another story tells of how this god angrily redistributed seven auras to the lions, the reed-beds, the palace, and various other places, after being presented with a head in a bag. This god created the sibling grain deities Lahar and Ashnan and fathered the god of diseases and pestilence, Namtar, on Ereshkigal. This deity, who was worshipped at the temple of Ekur, was exiled from Nippur after his vizier Nuska helped him facilitate an affair that led to the birth of the moon god Sin. He later fathered Ninazu and Nergal after the object of that affair, Ninlil, followed this god to the underworld. His attempt to kill off humanity with a flood was foiled when Utnapishtim was made immortal by Enki. FTP, identify this son of Anu and Ki, a Sumerian wind god.

answer: John Edward {Masefield}

One of this author’s poems stars a man who turns his life around and asks the “dear lily of delight” to “spring my heart again / that I may flower to men” after getting dressed down by both Jimmy Jaggard’s mother and the Quaker temperance advocate Miss Bourne. That poem by this man stars a man who runs around town claiming to be Satan after defeating Billy Myers in a boxing match. Sixteen years after writing about Saul Kane in “The Everlasting Mercy”, he wrote two children’s books starring Kay Harker, namely The Midnight Folk and The Box of Delights. In his best-known poem, he noted that “the call of the running tide / is a wild call and clear call that may not be denied” and stated that “All I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by.” That poem opens with the line “I must down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and sky”. FTP, name this English Poet Laureate who wrote “Sea-Fever”.

answer: {Lorentz} invariance [or {Lorentz} symmetry; prompt on "{isotropy} of the {speed} of {light}"]

This statement was tested at SYRTE in a series of experiments using a cryogenic sapphire oscillator and a hydrogen maser. Studying the absence of this can be aided by a Bumblebee model. That approach was co-advanced by Kostelecky. Another test of this looked at spin precession in Lithium 7. That experiment is known as the Hughes-Drever experiment. This does not hold when local tensor fields get vacuum expectation values. The Standard Model Extension includes operators that do not obey this. As Maxwell's field equations can be put in tensor form in 4-space, those equations have this property. A violation of CPT symmetry leads to a violation of this. If this holds, then the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same. FTP, name this invariance of the laws of physics under its namesake's transformations.

answer: Pope {Clement VII} (or {Giulio de Medici)}

The historian Paolo Giovio was this man’s personal physician and confidant for fifteen years. The monumental Storia d’Italia, or History of Italy, was written by a man he appointed viceregent of Romagna and then lieutenant-general in the papal army, Francesco Guicciardini. His imprisonment in the Castel Sant’Angelo helped lead to the election of Niccolò Capponi as Gonfaloniere of the Florentine Republic. With France, England, Florence, Milan, and Venice, he formed the League of Cognac, which could not prevent the sack of Rome at the hands of the Holy Roman Empire in 1527. FTP, name this cousin of Leo X, a Medici who served as pope from 1523 to 1534 and refused to annul the marriage between Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon.

answer: {T. Rex} [accept {Tyrannosaurus Rex} since that’s what they were originally called]

The final track on this band’s debut album is a fairy tale written by its lead singer and read by John Peel, called “Frowning Atahuallpa (My Inca Love)”. A song in which this band’s singer notes that “It’s plain to see, you were meant for me,” before asserting that he's the title figure, was included on a reissue of their 1973 album Tanx. In another song, this band advises you to perform the title action “like the people of the Beltane” and to “Wear your hair long, babe you can’t go wrong”. They featured a series of percussionists that included Steve Peregrin Took, Mickey Finn, and Bill Legend. One of their trademark songs is addressed to a figure with a “hubcap diamond star halo”, about whom the singer says “You’re dirty sweet, and you’re my girl”. This Marc Bolan-fronted glam rock band was honored in a song in which Roger Daltrey sings "I drunk myself blind to the sound of" this band. FTP, name this group, the artist of “Ride a White Swan”, and “Bang a Gong (Get it On)”.

answer: {Three Studies} for Figures at the {Base} of a {Crucifixion}

Infrared inspection of this work has shown that the small magenta horseshoe-like shapes surrounding the legs of its central subject were originally flowers. 44 years after this work was painted, its artist created a second version of it that made more explicit a pair of white tables and the shadows they cast. Matthias Grunewald’s Mocking of Christ likely inspired the blindfold worn by one of its subjects. John Russell once claimed that “there was painting in England before” this work, “and painting after it, and no one ... can confuse the two." Its left side features a ginger-haired figure perched atop a table, while on its right side, a patch of grass can be seen under the single limb of a figure with an elongated neck, large ear, and widely-opened mouth. Originally designed as a predella to a larger altarpiece, this work consists of a series of burnt-orange panels featuring distorted, elongated figures representing the Furies. FTP, name this 1944 triptych by Francis Bacon.

answer: {private language}

One work argues that the impossibility of this concept arises from a Humean sceptical solution to a certain paradox; that work uses the concepts of agreement, forms of life, and criteria to show that the paradox’s solution is only possible in a community. That work shows that the “problem of” this concept arises from the fact that it is impossible to know whether previous uses of the word “plus” reference the “plus function” or an invented “quus function.” The original treatment of this concept argues against it by showing that a past notation of ‘S’ in a diary cannot be verified to apply to any particular sensation. Saul Kripke claims that the argument of this concept is a special case of an argument regarding rule-following, in a work titled for rules and this concept. The best-known treatment of this argues against it by considering a group of people who all have boxes containing some object they decide to label a beetle. FTP, name this idea deemed impossible in Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations, which consists of words referencing things knowable only to the speaker.

Latif and Barnett connected variations in climate to interactions between the Aleutian low-pressure system and one of these. Henry Stommel explained the dynamics of their boundaries. They can form Taylor caps near the surface. Circulation is often studied using a “double” model of these. Subtropical ones have a thicker thermocline than tropical ones. They intensify on their western boundary as can be seen in the Kuroshio boundary. One of these in the North Pacific creates an enormous garbage patch. Ekman transport moves water into their centers. They are caused by the Coriolis force acting on currents driven by large scale wind patterns. FTP, name these large rotating currents in oceans.

answer: {Ahmose} [or {Amasis} ]

One ruler of this name created the tile Overseer of Southern Foreign Countries to consolidate his gains in Nubia, which were won in a campaign attested by a chronicler who also possessed this name and was known as “son of Ebana." Another ruler of this name conquered Cyprus and overthrew his predecessor after that man led a failed expedition to expel the Greeks from Cyrene in Libya. That ruler by this name created a royal bodyguard of Greek soldiers, and granted the city of Naucratis to Greek settlers. The second ruler of this name was the last significant pharaoh to rule from Sais, and Herodotus claims that he failed to fulfill a marriage pact between his daughter and Cambyses II, leading to the Persian invasion. The first ruler of this name conducted the Siege of Sharuhen after capturing Avaris. FTP, give this name of the pharaoh who expelled the Hyksos from Egypt and founded the Eighteenth Dynasty.

This architect argued for the building of structures with “a spiritual quality” which conveys a “feeling of eternity” in his essay “Monumentality,” written while he was a junior partner of Oscar Stonorov and George Howe. Seven glass blocks form his unrealized plan for a work in Battery Park, the Memorial to the Six Million Jewish Martyrs. He constructed a residence from two cubes attached at a 45 degree angle in his design for the Norman Fisher house. He designed the Indian Institute of Management, and he argued for the separation of “servant” and “served” in architectural spaces. One of his buildings features a ceiling made from tetrahedral concrete honeycombing, and another is an art museum consisting of a series of parallel barrel vaults. In addition to the Yale Art Gallery and the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, his designs include a medical research complex built around a central court with a water channel pointing toward the Pacific Ocean. FTP, name this American Jewish architect who designed the Salk Institute in La Jolla.

In Aboriginal beliefs, the transformed sacred objects and powers of the ancestors were known ngaraka wanga, which means the “country” of these objects. The Ainu would collect these into keyohniusi based on their origin. During the Hindu Asthi-Sanchaya ceremony, some of these referred to as “flowers” are collected. In Jewish folklore, one of these called a Luz can be used to bring the dead back to life. Josiah covers the spots of the Asherah poles he breaks with these. In 2nd Kings 13, a dead man is raised upon contact with these belonging to Elisha. Oded Golan claimed to own those of James, the brother of Jesus. After some time had passed, bleached ones would be moved from the top of a Zoroastrian Tower of Silence into a pit. In the Shang Dynasty, these objects were used to tell the future. In Genesis, Eve is constructed from a particular one of these belonging to Adam. FTP, name these body parts that make up the Grim Reaper.

answer: “{Battle Royal}” [prompt with "{more specific}" on {Invisible Man} until it is read]

At one point during this section of a larger work, its narrator is advised to “Live with your head in the lion’s mouth” and to “agree ‘em to death and destruction." The shouts of a man named Jackson cause this work’s narrator to worry that “he might crunch me between his teeth like a crisp ginger cookie." That narrator observes an American flag tattooed on the belly of a naked woman, whose dance occurs shortly after a school superintendent shouts “Bring up the little shines!” In this excerpt from a larger work, the narrator shouts “social equality” instead of “social responsibility”, the latter of which the laughter of a group of white men had forced him to repeat. After a one-on-one bout against a man named Tatlock, this chapter’s narrator is tricked into jumping onto an electrified carpet to retrieve gold coins, before finally being allowed to give the speech that wins him a scholarship to an all-black college. FTP, name this separately-published first chapter of Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man.

In NBSH, this functional group is attached via a sulfonyl to a benzene ring. One compound made from this functional group can be used in conjunction with iodine to detect sulfur in a spot test. That sodium salt can be used as a mutagen and in killing gram-negative bacteria. This functional group is also found attached to a furan in zidovudine, which is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. In a notable example of click chemistry, alkynes are joined to these via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. That reaction is named for Huisgen. Triphenylphosphine is used to reduce these in the Staudinger Reaction. A carboxylic compound with this functional group is subjected to heat in a rearrangement named for Curtius; that results in an isocyanate. FTP, name this unstable functional group that carries a negative charge and consists of three nitrogen atoms in a row.

answer: {Edward III} [or {Edward} of {Windsor} ]

This king regulated papal appointments to English benefices with the Statute of Provisors. He led a campaign known as the Burned Candlemas, and was the intended recipient of the Fieschi Letter, which claimed that his supposedly dead father was still alive. His son Lionel of Antwerp led an Irish expedition that resulted in the Statutes of Kilkenny, and his late rule was marked by influence of his mistress Alice Perrers. This signer of the Truce of Malestroit supported the pretensions of Edward Balliol to the Scottish throne after temporarily recognizing Scottish independence in the Treaty of Northampton. His father was overthrown by his mother and her lover, Roger Mortimer, who ruled England until removed by this king, who tired to fix wages at pre-Black Death levels with the Statute of Laborers. He was accompanied by his son Edward the Black Prince in his victory over Philip VI of France at Crécy. FTP, name this Plantagenet King of England whose claim to the crown of France led to the Hundred Years’ War.

This piece is quoted along with Shostakovich’s D-S-C-H theme and Lassus’s Stabat Mater in Alfred Schnittke’s Third String Quartet. One puzzling aspect of this piece’s notation is its composer’s use of pairs of tied eighth notes rather than quarter notes in one form of its main theme. A thirty-measure “Overtura” that begins with all the instruments playing a G in octaves opens this piece, which Stravinsky called an “absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever.” Originally intended as the finale to its composer’s String Quartet in B-flat, opus 130, it shares its form and key of B-flat major with the finale of its composer’s Hammerklavier sonata. FTP, name this late Beethoven work, a massive, highly dissonant essay in a contrapuntal form typically associated with J. S. Bach.

A follow-up to this work contains essays like Daniel Fife’s “Killing the Goose” and the original author’s “Living on a Lifeboat.” He co-edited that follow-up to this work with John Baden, and this work’s conclusion has been notably contested by Elinor Ostrom. This essay refers to Gregory Bateson’s argument that guilt results in a “double bind” to show the ineffectiveness of the creation of anxiety as a deterrent. It quotes from an article by Wiesner and York about a nuclear arms race to demonstrate the existence of problems with no technical solution. The author claims that natural selection guarantees that “conscience is self-eliminating” when it comes to population control, and goes on to argue against the United Nations, as there should be no “freedom to breed.” Government management and privatization are suggested as two solutions to the title problem by this work's author Garrett Hardin, who uses the classic example of farmers overgrazing their cattle on public pastureland. FTP, name this paper titled for the situation where individuals exploit a publicly-held resource for personal benefit.
