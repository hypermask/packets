answer: Robert {Schumann}

One work by this man quotes a Romance from a Heinrich Marschner opera based on Ivanhoe in its twelfth and final variation. That work begins with a C-sharp minor main theme taken from a flute piece by a composer whose illegitimate daughter was this man’s first fiancee. Another piano work by this man is called “Colorful Leaves,” and provided the theme for Brahms’s Variations Opus 9. This man’s own Opus 9 is a set of “cute scenes on four notes,” which opens with a “preamble” featuring alternating chords in dotted rhythms. One part of that work is meant to be read but not played, and is called “Sphinxes.” That work ends with the “March of the Davidsbündler against the Philistines,” and like the aforementioned Symphonic Etudes, it also represents the characters of Eusebius and Florestan. FTP, name this composer who quoted his own work Papillons in Carnaval.

answer: {Auger} effect

In one recent study, Mn-2+ dopants in quantum dots showed a higher degree of effectiveness than undoped dots for this effect. One special case of this effect is the Coster-Kronig transition, while the resonant form of this occurs in case of a lower Rydberg state allowing coupling between its central particles. Its yield increases with atomic number, showing a 50% likelihood of occurrence in zinc-30. In this effect’s analogous recombination in semiconductors, an electron and an electron-hole combine and give their energy to a third particle. Discovered by Lise Meitner two years prior to its discovery by its French namesake, this effect occurs when a vacancy in the innermost K-shell of an electron is filled. FTP, name this effect in which an electron is emitted instead of a photon after an electron transitions to an inner shell, which gives its name to a type of spectroscopy.

answer: {Bartholomew Fayre}: A {Comedy}

This play begins with a Stage-Keeper apologizing to the audience for the delayed start, saying that there's a problem with one of the players’ black silk stockings. The Stage-Keeper then criticizes the play for lacking elements like jugglers and trained apes, but he's shooed off stage by the Book-Keeper. The servant Humphrey Waspe comes to town in search of a marriage license, and gets into a fight with Knockem, resulting in a trip to the stocks, but the lawyer Trouble-All shows up and demands a warrant. It's revealed that Littlewit's stage puppets have no genitalia, and therefore cannot be guilty of crossdressing. The characters then pair off with Dame Purecraft being won by Quarlous at the house of Justice Adam Overdo. Also known for featuring the Puritan Zeal-of-the-Land Busy, FTP, name this Jacobean play about misadventures at a summer festival in London, a work by Ben Jonson.

answer: Karen {Horney}

This thinker wrote an essay entitled “The Overvaluation of Love” which looks at the histories of seven women and their obsessive need for a male partner. This theorist believed that people have two views of the self: the ideal self is used as a model for the real self when working toward self-actualization, but trouble arises when the real self deteriorates into the despised self. The need for a partner and the need for social recognition are two of this thinker's ten patterns of needs - which are classified as "moving towards," "moving against," or "moving away from" people. Those three coping strategies were outlined by this thinker in the book Our Inner Conflicts. This author of New Ways in Psychoanalysis, and founder of the American Journal of Psychoanalysis, argued that cultural factors and not biological factors explain the different neuroses that arise in men and women. FTP, name this female psychoanalyst who developed the notion of womb envy.

answer: {Anglo-Zanzibar} War

At the end of this conflict, the German ship Seeadler rescued the losing side’s commander. One party to this conflict had to deal with the questionable loyalty of askari troops under Arthur Raikes. That side's land forces were commanded by Lloyd Mathews, while Admiral Harry Rawson held a blockade with the ships Racoon, Thrush, and Sparrow. The initial cause of the war was the death of Hamad bin Thuwaini, which led to a coup by Khalid bin Bargash, who seized the "House of Wonders" or Beit al-Ajaib - a palace located in modern-day Stone Town. Khalid escaped thanks to German aid at this conflict, which is often called the shortest war in history. FTP, name this 1896 war which may have lasted about 40 minutes, a conflict between England and a protectorate which later became part of Tanzania.

answer: {Moroni} ({Captain Moroni}, or the Angel {Moroni})

A commander by this name once tore off his coat, and fastened it to a pole with a pledge written on it, calling it the "Title of Liberty." That commander wrote a letter to Pahoran which convinced him to aid in slaying Pachus, who had risen to power in Zarahembla. This figure had previously led a counter-revolution against Ameleckiah. The seventh chapter of a book named after this figure states that “a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water” and therefore a follower of Christ "cannot be a servant of the devil.” In another episode, this figure recounts an epistle from his father rejecting baptism of small children. This last surviving Nephite was forced into hiding after his father’s forces were destroyed by the Lamanites at Cumorah. FTP, name this son of Mormon who, after his death, became the angel tasked with delivering the Golden Plates to Joseph Smith.

answer: {acetylcholine} [ {also} accept {2-Acetoxy-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium} ]

A monomethylmercuric cation’s affinity for sulfhydryl groups inhibits the enzyme that synthesizes this molecule. Repetitive nerve stimulation at frequencies of two to five Hz depletes stores of this molecule and decreases compound motor action potential amplitudes, a process termed the decremental response. That electrodiagnostic study is frequently helpful in the diagnosis of botulism, as botulin blocks this compound’s release. Anticholinergic agents such as scopolamine competitively inhibit this compound’s binding to muscarinic receptors, and antibody inhibition of this compound’s binding to nicotinic receptors causes myasthenia gravis. Depletion of levels of this compound in the brain has been connected to Alzheimer’s disease. FTP, name this neurotransmitter that works at the neuromuscular junction to prompt muscle contraction.

In the upper left of one work by this artist, a man grabs the head of a figure who seems to be passing through an invisible door. A snarling tiger holds a pink card that reads “getting old sucks!” in his The Blue Tattoo, while he reworked the Dying Gaul sculpture at the Pergamon Altar in his canvas Reclining Youth. The fourth painting in a series by this artist shows the leg and torso of a man in the trunk of a car - that work is dubbed “El Salvador." A more famous work shows four men in denim shirts, one of whom smokes a cigarette and holds his right hand in front of the bag-covered head of a naked man tied to a chair. Known for scraping away thick paint from his work with a meat cleaver, FTP, name this Chicago painter of enormous, room-sized paintings like the White Squad and Interrogation series.

answer: The {Bridge}

In one work in this collection, the author remembers that "behind my father's cannery works, I used to see rail-squatters ranged in nomad raillery." A study of this work by L.S. Dembo is titled for the author's "Sanskrit Charge." The opening piece refers to “harp and altar, of the fury fused” before asking “How could mere toil align thy choiring strings?” The question “Whose head is swinging from the swollen strap?” in this work is prompted by a ride from Columbus Circle. A river "tortured with history" is described in the section on "Powhatan's Daughter," while San Luis de Angel and Juan Perez are addressed by Columbus in "Ave Maria." Composed of fifteen sections including Cape Hatteras, Quaker Hill and The Tunnel, FTP, name this long poem which opens with an invocation to a Brooklyn landmark, a work by Hart Crane.

answer: Sir Francis {Walsingham}

This man succeeded Henry Norris as ambassador to France, and his home in Paris became a headquarters for Protestant refugees in the wake of St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre - in his 64-page account of that massacre, he advised breaching relations with France. This man's secretary and closest advisor was Robert Beale, who was wed to the sister of his wife Ursula St. Barbe - that marriage also led this man to gain a son-in-law, the poet Philip Sidney. His advice to pursue military action in the Low Countries was realized in the Treaty of Nonsuch. He oversaw reconstruction of Dover Harbour and opposed the Duke of Anjou's marriage to the queen, after he'd begun his term as principal secretary of England, replacing William Cecil. Known for thwarting the designs of Francis Throckmorton and Anthony Babington, FTP, name this "spymaster" who performed espionage under Queen Elizabeth I.

In one YouTube video, he notes that “Google is a little bit naughty,” while in another, he bemoans the “condom-on-cock crisis." In one role, this actor tries to convince a title character to make a deadly voyage around the Cape of Good Hope after bringing him a potato, but he just returns with a bottle of urine. In another role, he claims that “hooch” is an Eskimo word to explain the lyrics of “Minnie the Moocher." He treats an FBI agent who shoots a clown ornament off an ice cream truck in his recurring role as Dr. Gordon Wyatt on Bones. This fan of the Norwich City Football Club began serving in 2003 as the host of a game show with idiotic panelist Alan Davies. This man, who plays Melchett on Blackadder, became an audience favorite on University Challenge when he appeared with Queens’ College in 1980.

answer: {hydrazones} [do not accept or prompt on {hydrazine} or {hydrazides} or other wrong answers]

Barton sometimes names a method using a non-nucleophilic base to convert this class of reactants into a vinyl iodide. They are not imines, but the reaction of a certain precursor to this group with tosyl chlorine produces an important reagent, and that reagent’s most frequent application with a strong base in two rounds creates this class of compound as an intermediary. The reaction of those bases' final product is a vinyllithium compound. Members of this group are frequently synthesized from an aryl diazonium salt and a beta-keto-ester in the Japp-Klingemann reaction. This functional group is also commonly formed from reaction of a similarly named compound discovered by Kurtius with a ketone or aldehyde, whose oxygen molecule is then replaced with an NNH2 group. FTP, name this intermediary state of reactants in the Shapiro and Wolff-Kischner reactions.

This man’s older brother Alexander succeeded Caleb Cushing as the second U.S. Commissioner to China, two years after he'd declined an appointment to be the first Commissioner. That brother edited the North American Review, which published stories referring to this man as "Old Granny," a title he received serving as president of Harvard, where students held rallies to burn his image in effigy. This first American to receive a Ph.D. in Germany drafted Commodore Matthew Perry’s letter to the Japanese during his four-month stint as Millard Fillmore’s Secretary of State. He resigned from the Senate after being absent for the vote on the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Also known for being the running mate of John Bell in 1860, this man once declared “God bless the Union; it is dearer to us for the blood of brave men which has been shed in its defenses.” FTP, name this Whig orator from Massachusetts who delivered a two-hour keynote speech at Gettysburg.

answer: {Concluding Unscientific Postscript} to the Philosophical {Framents}: A Mimical-Pathetical-Dialectical Compilation, an {Existential Contribution}

One section of this work declares that "evening taking leave of the day" and saying farewell is a riddle, which is like a mother telling her child to be home in good time. The speaker overhears a grandfather and his 10-year-old grandson standing at the grave of a newly-deceased father, and resolves to give instruction to the grandson. A section dedicated to Gotthold Lessing recounts a story about god holding “all truth” and “the desire for all truth” in opposite hands. A more widely read chapter uses the image of “swimming in water 70,000 fathoms deep,” and finds that truth unrelated to individual existence is bound by doubt, so the speaker promotes “The Subjective Truth." The work ends with a total retraction of itself after contrasting the Speculative and Hegelian points of view on Christianity. FTP, name this "Mimical-Pathetical-Dialectical Compilation," which was intended as an addendum to Philosophical Fragments, and was meant to be the last philosophical work by Kierkegaard.

answer: {Philip IV} or {Philip} the {Fair}

This king entertained the monk Rabban Bar Sauma at his court, and was sent a letter by Arghun of the Ilkhanate which promised to bestow Jerusalem upon him - in return, he sent his own diplomat Gobert de Helleville, but he never formed the anticipated alliance with the Mongols. After he personally led his army to victory at Mons-en-Pevele, he forced the Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge upon Robert III, the Count of Flanders. He established the Chamber of Accounts to manage financial matters and widely diffused gold coinage. Prior to the above treaty, his army was routed at the Battle of the Golden Spurs, sometimes referred to as Courtrai. This ruler's aide Guillaume de Nogaret is often given credit for conducting the trial of Jacques de Molay, and for being the one who slapped a certain figure, leading to the bull “Unam sanctam." That was part of this king's feud with Boniface VIII, which led him to remove the papacy to Avignon. FTP, name this French king from 1285 to 1314, who was nicknamed for his handsome appearance.

This project differentiated itself on two inclusions, a quick algorithm which uses its “inversive-decimation method” to test a particular quality of a “characteristic polynomial of a linear recurrance”, and an incomplete array used to allow for its unique type of period. The problem of a slow start when using user-generated initial states was solved with the 2007 release of a “SIMD-oriented Fast” version of this program, and that slowness had almost necessitated the usage of a lagged Fibbonacci generator to create a seed. This algorithm cannot independently produce cryptographically secure results unlike its main competitor Blum Blum Shub. FTP, name this Monte Carlo accessory with common application in video games, whose homepage by developers Nishimura and Matsumoto notes that it has a period of 2^(19937)-1 - hence its name, since it's a “very fast random number generator”.

One dissent in this case objects to the limited grant of certiorari, arguing that the Court should have also dealt with the discriminatory jury selection and the outright hostility of one jury member in particular - that dissent justified his approach with the case of Breard v. Alexandria, decided the same day. Another dissent quotes at length from Brandeis' concurrence in Whitney v. California, which heralds the "processes of education." This decision was restricted six years later by the Yates case. The plurality opinion by Justice Vinson relies on Learned Hand’s language weighing whether the “the gravity of the evil, discounted by its improbability” will justify invasion of free speech. The dissents of Black and Douglas would not prevail until this case was effectively overruled by Brandenburg v. Ohio. FTP, name this 1951 case, which upheld conviction under the Smith Act of eleven leaders of the Communist Party.
