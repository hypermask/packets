answer: The {Mizoroki-Heck} reaction

One variation of this reaction uses the ionic liquid HEmimBF4 instead of phosphine ligands, and thallium and silver salts are used to control regioselectivity in one step. Like the Sonagashira reaction, this reaction makes use of a zero-valent organometallic catalyst. It is used commercially to couple naphthalene derivatives to ethylene, forming naproxen and this reaction is used in the Danishefsky Taxol total synthesis to close the B ring of enol triflate. After syn-addition of the reactants, this reaction forms its product with a beta hydride elimination, before reductive elimination with base regenerates the catalyst, a cycle similar to one employed in the Wacker process. FTP, name this reaction that joins an unsaturated halide to an alkene with an organo-palladium catalyst.

To defend one of his hypotheses, this thinker developed the "Male Marriageable Pool Index," which is the number of employed men per 100 women in a given age group. He collaborated with Richard Taub on a study examining the Chicago neighborhoods of Archer Park, Beltway, Dover, and Groveland. He identifies three stages in American history including the "antebellum and early post-bellum" or "racist period," the era of rapid industrialism which birthed the black urban community, and the "post World War II era" dominated by class conflict rather than race conflict. He recently taught a class on the HBO series The Wire, whose second season was inspired by his book When Work Disappears. FTP, name this author of The Declining Significance of Race, a sociologist who writes on African American life and teaches at Harvard.

A more famous example of this scene was commissioned by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini and is one of six lunette paintings in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj - that version has a river cutting through the middle which is crossed by a man standing in a canoe. Perhaps the best known canvas of Adam Elsheimer is a dark moonlit canvas with a campfire on the left showing this scene, while Jan Breughel the Elder did one alternately called The Forest's Edge.

answer: {Natural History} ( {Naturalis Historiae} )

In one section of this work, the author writes "all men are in the same state from their last day forward as they were before their first day" and says that wishful thinking falsely invents a life that continues beyond death. The Preface sees the author praise his own professionalism because he lists his sources at the beginning of every book. The first book discusses astronomy and declares that Venus is the only heavenly body other than the sun and moon to cast a shadow. Other parts contain a biography of the Greek painter Apelles, and describe the catoblepas whose eye can make any human expire, as well as a two-headed creature called the amphisbaena. This thirty-seven volume work was dedicated to the "emperor Titus," and survives, unlike its author's 20-volume work on the history of the German Wars.

answer: {Les Preludes}: Poeme symphonique No. 3 [or The Preludes: Symphonic Poem No. 3]

This piece was originally conceived as the overture to a choral work called The Four Elements. In this work’s 12/8 “Andante maestoso” sections, the upper woodwinds and trumpets twice play a first-inversion minor arpeggio, whose root is harmonized as the third of a major chord. “The calm serenity of life in the fields” after a storm depicted in this work is described in its program, which was inspired by the Poetic Meditations of Lamartine. In the “Allegro Marziale” section, the melody of an earlier horn solo is transformed into a march-like phrase that goes E-E-D-G, E-C-A-C-D-E. Each of this work’s first two measures consists of a pizzicato C on the third beat, after which this work’s ubiquitous motive C-B-E is first introduced.

answer: {Neural crest}

Markers used for these cells include HNK-1, and before activation these cells strongly express the slug transcription factor. In Treacher-Collins syndrome, mutations in the treacle protein cause depletion of these cells, leading to characteristic skull abnormalities. The function of this tissue was originally discovered by Le Douarin using quail-chick embryo chimeras. Mutations in the RET tyrosine kinase cause aberrant functions in several derivatives of these cells, including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and 2B. Another disease associated with abnormal migration of these cells characteristically causes aganglionic megacolon, and these cells also differentiate into melanocytes and large portions of the autonomic nervous system. DiGeorge’s syndrome, Hirschsprung’s disease, and cleft lip can all be caused by abnormal migration of this embryonic tissue. This tissue is formed from ectoderm in the border between the neural plate and the future epidermis, and pinches off after the formation of the neural tube. FTP, name this multipotent embryonic tissue that migrates throughout the body, which despite its name forms much more than just nervous system components.

He discussed the presence of both sex and philosophy in Friedrich Schlegel's novel Lucinde in his essay "The Concept of Irony." Both of those essays are in his posthumous collection The Aesthetic Ideology, while he argued that "Resistance to Theory" is theory itself in another essay, and included the above essay on irony in his The Rhetoric of Romanticism.

answer: {Halo effect} (or the {"affect heuristic"} before mentioned)

This phenomenon was examined in a 1976 study by Efran and Patterson, which analyzed the outcomes of Canadian federal elections, while a 1991 study by Eagly and Ashmore found that this occurs to a greater degree with regard to women than men. In the classic experiment, this phenomenon was demonstrated by having college students watch a videotaped interview with an instructor who spoke in a strong Belgian accent. That experiment was conducted at the University of Michigan by Timothy Wilson and Richard Nisbett. As initially explained, this phenomenon happens when people use "global evaluations" unconsciously to alter their judgments about traits like intelligence or expertise. This cognitive bias is sometimes referred to as the "affect heuristic."

One theorem named for this man states that the number of subgroups whose order has prime divisor p is equal to 1 mod p. Those structures are always conjugate to each other, implying that when one of them is normal, it is also unique.
