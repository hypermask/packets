answer: Melanie {Klein}

This psychologist’s methodology was expanded by Donald Winnicott’s “squiggle” exercise in which a patient is given a squiggly line and told to turn it into something meaningful. This thinker describes how people try to expel a negative personal belief onto another person and act as though that belief were true in a process called “projective identification.” Roger Money-Kyrle and Susan Isaacs led a group of this psychologist’s followers in a series of psychological debates called the “Controversial Discussions.” Children were given a box of unmarked toys and observed as they acted out violent fantasies, in this psychologist's implementation of “play therapy." This thinker argued that the “paranoid-schizoid position” develops into the “depressive position” when children can recognize entities as a whole, and no longer differentiate good and bad aspects of something as separate objects. This pioneer of "object relations" theory authored the book The Psychoanalysis of Children. FTP, name this female psychologist who split with Anna Freud in arguing that the superego exists from birth.

answer: {Nitric Oxide} [accept {NO} before mention, accept "{Nitrosyl}" until "arcing electricity" do *not* accept "{nitrous oxide}," "{nitrogen dioxide}," "{nitrous acid}," or "{nitric acid}"]

Along with sulfido groups, a form of this compound binds to iron in Roussin Salts. This chemical is inefficiently produced by arcing electricity in the first step of the Birkeland-Eyde process, but more commonly from ammonia in the first step of many acid-producing processes such as HOKO and Hycon. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor is probably just this chemical, which is generated from L-arginine and NADPH. This chemical's biological functions include activating guanylate cyclase and increasing vasodilation; Viagra works through this chemical's signalling pathway. Catalytic converters serve to decompose this chemical into oxygen and nitrogen. FTP, name this diatomic chemical with formula NO.

One of these events forced the hiring of Charles Cox by Kennecott Copper Corporation, whose executive structure had been ruined. That one resulted in the hanging of Marguerite Pitre and was carried out by Albert Guay, who was tubercular when he was executed in Montreal. Twenty-one years after another of these events, it was discovered that Inderjit Singh Reyat had perjured himself. A group in the Philippines planned to assault a motorcade on World Youth Day 1995 to divert attention from a failed set of these events, known as Oplan Bojinka. Another example resulted in the conviction of Dandeny Muñoz Mosquera of the Medellin cartel and affected the net worth of the Avianca company.

This quantity is generally independent of constraints on a system’s motion, a fact that d’Alembert used in the original formulation of his namesake principle. The virtual work on a body is given by the vector of variations in the Lagrangian coordinates dotted with this quantity; that’s because this quantity’s nth component is the applied force on the system dotted into the partial derivative of the displacement with respect to the nth generalized coordinate. FTP, name this derived vector quantity of Lagrangian mechanics, usually denoted by a capital-Q and given by the gradient of the virtual work with respect to the generalized coordinates.

answer: {logic minimization} [or {term minimization}; accept word forms of “{minimization}”]

This task can be accomplished approximately by a heuristic algorithm published by Robert Brayton and extended to multi-valued systems by Richard Rudell; that tool is Espresso. A deterministic EXPTIME algorithm to solve this problem begins by determining the so-called DC- and ON-covers, then creates the set of so-called prime implicants, and finally eliminates as many of these as possible; that is the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. For simple systems, this job can be done by translating the system’s truth table into a square-shaped Gray code, and then grouping minterms, that being the method of Karnaugh maps. FTP, name this process of finding the smallest set of Boolean functions to create a given output, generally done at the start of digital circuit design to create circuits requiring the least number of gates.

In one work by this author, a cornered Jewish girl named Violet exclaims that Jesus was a Jew and gets the response “Kind of, but not really” - in that play, a troupe in the village of Oberammergau in Nazi Germany, a collection of persecuted Catholics in Elizabethan England, and a South Dakota town all attempt to put on the title Passion Play. In another play, Jean picks up the title device after the black-market organ salesman Gordon collapses in a diner. This author used a chorus of cruel talking stones, an elevator in which it rains, and a train station in another play to adapt the Greek underworld. In addition to Dead Man’s Cell Phone and Eurydice, more recent plays by this author include one about the Brazilian housemaid Matilde and her desire to be a comedian, and another in which Mrs. Daldry and Mrs. Givings have boring missionary-position sex lives with their husbands, but receive a treatment for hysteria that lets them orgasm.

answer: {Anti}-{Intellectualism} in American {Life}

This work cites the quote “God is a twenty-four hour station. All you need is to do is plug it in.” to analyze how technical vocabulary is invading religious self-help books, in a chapter about “spiritual technology.” The author describes how the rise of the machine industry created a line of demarcation designating everything as either “utilitarian” or “traditional” in a section entitled “The Decline of the Gentleman.” One chapter of this work uses the term “mugwump culture” to refer to an attitude valuing respectability over originality, explaining why second-rate writers like Bryant, Lowell, and Whittier were preferred over Whitman and Poe. This book analyzes the “cult of experience” to explain why businesses prefer self-made men rather than educated men in its fourth part “The Practical Culture." The second part, “The Religion of the Heart,” argues that Puritanism was replaced by evangelical religion and Jacksonian egalitarianism, which are two causes of the title suspicion. Winner of the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for Non-Fiction, its author followed with the book The Paranoid Style in American Politics.

He uses a G-sharp arpeggio to depict ascending waves in the section “ A Boat on the Ocean” of a piano work whose other parts include “The Valley of Bells” and “Night-Moths.” This composer of Piano Concerto in G uses a recurring B-flat ostinato to represent tolling bells surrounding the corpse of a hanged man in a section called “Le Gibet.” This composer of Miroirs was commissioned by Paul Wittgenstein to write a piano concerto for the left hand, and he depicted an evil dwarf in a section titled “Scarbo” designed to be more difficult than Islamey.

answer: “ {Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came”}

One section of this poem discusses grass that “grew as scant as hair / in leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud / Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood.” The speaker asserts “I never saw a brute I hated so / He must be wicked to deserve such pain” after encountering an emaciated blind horse, and claims “I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart," reflecting on the fate of his deceased friends Cuthbert and Giles. The third to last stanza, begins with the question “Not See?” and describes how the “day / came back again” to illuminate hills “like giants”; while the penultimate stanza begins with the question “Not Hear?” The speaker receives directions from “that hoary cripple, with malicious eye” and, after traveling through a barren valley, reaches the title location and claims “Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set / and blew.” This poem was first published in the collection Men and Women, and inspired by Edgar’s mad song in King Lear.
