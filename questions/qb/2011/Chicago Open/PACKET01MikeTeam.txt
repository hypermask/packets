answer: {Electra}

One figure by this name was the wife of Corythus on the island of Samothrace - she reportedly took refuge under the Palladium after being raped by Zeus, but Athena grew angry and flung the Palladium to earth, where this figure gave it to her son Dardanus. Another figure of this name has her speech often compared to a nightingale’s song, and she mocks the corpse of a man murdered mid-sacrifice, stating “May I never have a husband with a girl's face, but one with a man's ways." She identifies a scar on the brow of another character as caused by chasing a fawn in his youth. She attempts to convince her sister Chrysothemis to work with her, but gets warned that Aegisthus is planning to imprison her. FTP, name this subject of eponymous plays by Sophocles and Euripides, the sister of Orestes.

This author writes about how “Koreans or Malaysians” were “gossiping over tea and noodles on their break” in his poem "Shirt." The speaker recounts how “In 1927 the Chief of Police / And Mrs W. killed themselves together” in his poem “At Pleasure Bay," which draws on his experience growing up in Long Branch, New Jersey. He presents Pentheus and Dionysus as psychologists in a poem dedicated to his Stanford professor Yvor Winters, whom he uses to defend the madness of poets. Players inhabit the minds of Dr. Eva Fein and the dead rock star Bobby Clemon in this man’s foray into text adventure, Mindwheel. His better known collections include Sadness and Happiness and The Want Bone, and he notably created a verse translation of Dante's Inferno. FTP, name this man who succeeded Robert Hass as U.S. Poet Laureate in 1997, and is the poetry editor for Slate magazine.

answer: {Zinc 2+} [accept {Zn} ]

A protein found in snake venom which inactivates serpins contains a “Met-turn” coordinated to this ion. That protein, Adamalysin II, is related to a family of proteins with a “cysteine switch” region that catalyze breakdown of collagen, also containing this metal in their active site. Two ions of this element activate a water molecule and the serine residue at the active site of alkaline phosphatase. This element is also critical to the activity of an enzyme which allows for interconversion of carbon dioxide with bicarbonate, carbonic anhydrase, and an enzyme which produces acetaldehyde from alcohols. Also found in binding domains of a protein associated with DNA polymerase, FTP, name this metal found in alcohol dehydrogenase and those namesake cysteine and histidine- filled “fingers.”

While working as a deputy minister, this man publicly apologized to Ambassador Joseph Grew for the sinking of an American naval vessel. A cryptography team which included John Paul Stevens revealed information about his activities as part of “Operation Vengeance.” This man, who previously studied at Harvard, became known in his youth for his anti-war stance, as demonstrated by his apocryphal quote “I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with terrible resolve.” Cabinet member Frank Knox was infamously ordered to “get” this man, who vigorously opposed the Tripartite Agreement of 1940. He was killed in April 1943 when American planes shot his aircraft down while he was inspecting forces near the Solomon Islands. FTP, name this commander-in-chief of the Japanese Navy during the early days of World War II, who was a key planner of Pearl Harbor.

answer: {Mimesis} : The {Reproduction} of Reality in Western Literature

One section of this work analyzes a passage where people of all creeds mingle in the stock exchange, illuminating the comparative stature of business and religion in Montesquieu’s Philosophical Letters. Another section uses passages about the murder of Sicharius and the urination of horses to praise honesty and directness in Gregory of Tours. Its final chapter, "The Brown Stocking," describes the narratological value of unexplained details like the color of a sock, in works such as Woolf's To a Lighthouse. Its most famous section uses a revelation made to Eurykleia and the sacrifice of Isaac to show the difference between the Classical and Judeo-Christian traditions - that chapter is named after "Odysseus' Scar." FTP, name this book subtitled “The Representation of Reality in Western Literature," the masterpiece of Erich Auerbach.

answer: {Fountain}

The first public showing of this work was in the second issue of The Blind Man, published by Beatrice Wood, after a previous non-public showing led to the resignation of Walter Arensberg. This piece was set against the backdrop of a Marsden Hartley painting entitled The Warriors showing a group of white knights - that depiction occurs in a photograph by Alfred Stieglitz. It was partly based on a “fat little funny man” who appeared in a syndicated comic strip with Jeff. This piece was suspended from the ceiling of its artist's studio in a photo that also includes Hat Rack and In Advance of the Broken Arm. George Bellows compared it to “horse manure glued to a canvas," a view shared by the Society of Independent Artists, whose panel rejected this piece. FTP, name this piece signed by “R. Mutt," a readymade by Duchamp, which is the preeminent work in the urinal genre.

Types of these that range in temperature from 0.1 to 10 degrees Kelvin are known as “dynamically cold”. The short period of 3.17 hours of one of these objects has led astronomers to speculate it has a highly elongated shape. Besides Varuna, solid ethane and methane have been found on one of these objects that once reached the unusally high temperature of negative 160 degrees Celsius named Quaoar. Strazzulla and Johnson argued that space-weathering was responsible for the redness in a cluster of these objects. David Jewitt and Jane Luu discovered the first of these objects in 1992 and named it Ouroboros. An object also classified as a dwarf planet, Makemake, is the largest one of these entities. They are found in a region sometimes named for Kenneth Edgeworth, and, unlike Plutinos, they do not have an orbital resonance with Neptune. FTP, name these classical Kuiper Belt objects.

An American author of this descent wrote about Agu, who's forced into combat by the evil Commandant and killed by Rambo in Beasts of No Nation. Another young author born in this country wrote of a protagonist who uses the help of TillyTilly to defeat her mean cousin Dulcie. Besides The Icarus Girl, another author born here told a "Hunter's Saga" in his best-known novel Forest of a Thousand Demons. That novel was translated from this country's native language by another author of this nation, who wrote the radio play A Scourge of Hyacinths, which was transmitted by the BBC in 1991. He also wrote about a man who says "there are eggs and there are eggs", and preaches sermons on public beaches because he doesn't have a church - that guy is the hypocrite Brother Jero. The missionary Captain Winterbottom appoints a character who's pressured to call the feast of the new yam in another book. FTP, name this African country, which produced novels like Sozaboy and Arrow of God.

answer: {Nicopolis} (or {Nikopol} )

In one battle by this name, the losing force escaped annihilation only because the winning commander recognized the banner of his brother-in-law Nikolai Gojranski, and did not want to harm him. The losing side in that battle was meant to be commanded by Mircea the Elder, who refused to help after his command was objected to. It was fought at the city which had been the capital of Ivan Shishman, before he was expelled three years earlier. Another city by this name was founded on the Ambracian Gulf after the Battle of Actium by Augustus, and Paul directed Titus to visit him there in his Epistle to Titus. The previous battle saw a reckless charge by John the Fearless into the akinji and timariot soldiers of the opposing commander, who was known as "the Thunderbolt." That battle is often called the last Crusade. FTP, name that 1396 battle in Bulgaria, a name shared by several cities which take their name from the Greek for "city of victory."

answer: {cello concertos} [accept word forms]

Alfred Schnittke’s second work of this type uses a theme from his film score for Agony in its fifth movement Grave section. Carl Stamitz wrote three of these for the King of Prussia, and another of these was written for Raya Garbousova. That work’s second movement features a siciliana-like oboe melody, and its first movement opens with a short motive consisting of a 2/4 and a 3/4 bar. Another work of this type has three movements that are played continuously, and uses a repeated descending triplet theme. That A-minor work, its composer’s first, was dedicated to Auguste Tolbecque. Another piece of this type sees the violas present the first theme after the soloist’s opening four-bar recitative. FTP, name this type of orchestral work featuring a solo string instrument, which include one by Barber, two by Saint-Saens, and an E-minor one notably recorded by Jacqueline du Pré and composed by Elgar.

According to legend, the arrows owned by this figure were each tipped with a half-ounce of gold - so that, even if they killed their target, the gold could be sold by the victim's family to ease their suffering. He wrote a letter called the “Zafarnamah” or "Epistle of Victory" which describes the Battle of Chamkaur, where he shot two arrows into the bed of Wazir Khan. Upon death, he used his horse Dilbagh to ascend to heaven at Nanded. Five of his followers were known as the "Panj Piare," or beloved ones, because they had enough faith to go into his tent even after he emerged with a sword dripping blood. Those followers carry daggers, wooden combs, and iron bracelets and were the first members of the Khalsa. He succeeded his father Tegh Bahadur and was pursued for a time by Aurangzeb. FTP, name this tenth guru of Sikhism, the final human one before the Guru Granth Sahib.

This character owns a cigarette case inscribed with a sonnet from Elizabeth Browning - "if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death!," - that case was given to him by a sick girl. He improved his physique at a local athletic club and now weighs 207 pounds, allowing him to be punched in the belly without suffering pain. When the protagonist meets him, she judges him to be “superior to the others” due to his “sensitive look,” but he disturbs her when he pointedly asks how old she is after one date. He continually frets about his sick mother and refuses to marry the protagonist after getting information on her sordid past from her brother-in-law, who is this character's coworker and poker buddy. FTP, name this character from A Streetcar Named Desire, a friend of Stanley’s who has an ill-fated relationship with Blanche DuBois.

answer: {reversal} of the {geomagnetic} field (accept any equivalents - "the {Earth switching polarity}" - anything like that)

The most reliable timescale for these events was developed in 1992 by Cande and Kent - it aims to include all intervals of these events greater than 30 kiloyears - those less than 30 kyr are given the designation "crypto." One of these events named after Jaramillo may be related to a tektite-producing impact field on the Ivory Coast. Other examples are named after findings at Cobb Mountain and Mungo Lake. A "three-dimensional self-consistent computer simulation" of one of these events was produced by Glatzmaier and Roberts. A particularly major one of these is named after Brunhes and Matuyama, whose observations in Japan first confirmed their timing. This phenomenon allowed confirmation of the idea of seafloor spreading by Vine and Matthews, because it results in symmetrical "stripes" radiating outward from mid-oceanic ridges. FTP, name this type of geologic event that happens when the Earth enters a new Chronozone by switching from north to south.

This thinker derisively claimed "the libertarian is the only believer in causation" at the opening of his early essay "The Ego as Cause." In other works, he wrote a chapter entitled "The United States, Incorporated" which imagined corporate takeover, and wrote about the "free play of intelligence." He advocated making “nature and the science of nature the willing servants of human good," and stated that communication is the key to turning the “Great Society” into a “Great Community." His namesake Commission included men like Carleton Beals and investigated Soviet charges against Leon Trotsky. This author of “What Humanism Means to Me” wrote the previous book to rebut the claims of Walter Lippmann, who held that "the public" was a phantom. FTP, name this author of The Quest for Certainty, an American philosopher who wrote all kinds of works on democracy and education.

This ruler gained control over Jalu and Aujila by the Rajma Agreement, which also provided for monthly payments to support his military. His tenure oversaw discovery of petroleum deposits at Zaltan, which led him to launch a five-year plan to promote agriculture in his country. He allowed the United States to lease Wheelus Air Base, which later became Mitiga International Airport. His grandfather was the founder of the Sanussi order, which this ruler adopted as the name of his dynasty, and he ruled partly from a separate capital at Benghazi. Like Gemal Nasser, he was removed from power by a group which called itself the Free Officers Movement. Known as the "Emir of Cyrenaica," FTP, name this monarch overthrown in 1969 by the forces of Muammar Gaddafi, the first and only king of Libya.

This character was raised in a village called Delight at a small wooden house, which had a library and a greyhound, after she'd been tutored from the age of 12 to 16 by a Swiss governess. She laughs and leaves the room when she's given a pair of diamond earrings in memory of her first meeting with the gift-giver, whose father soon demands the earrings returned. In one scene, she throws a large roll of money into a fire, offering it to a suitor if he removes it with his bare hands. Raised and educated by Totsky, her initials are used to replace the letters A. M. D. in the reading of a poem by Pushkin. She repeatedly runs away from weddings, including one near the end in Pavlovsk, and the main character first sees her portrait when Ganya shows it to General Epanchin.

answer: {Friedel}-{Crafts} (prompt on {Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution} or {EAS})

This reaction is closely related to one in which use of vinyl mercuric chloride solves stereochemical complications in synthesis of alpha, beta- unsaturated ketones from alkenes. In a recent modification of this reaction found by Allemann and Siegel, which could be used for fullerene synthesis, a tri-isopropylsilyl cation and a carborane anion are used to synthesize polyaromatic compounds from aryl fluorides. This reaction is followed by two Clemmensen reductions in a reaction using succinic anhydride to produce naphthalenes discovered by Haworth. In another variant of this reaction, carbon monoxide and HCl are reacted with benzene derivatives to form benzaldehydes. Modified by the Gattermann-Koch reaction, this reaction is often catalyzed with aluminum chloride. FTP, name this Lewis acid catalyzed reaction in which acyl or alkyl groups are added to an aromatic ring.
