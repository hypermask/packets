answer: {Ten Days} That {Shook} the {World}

In George Orwell’s proposed preface to Animal Farm, entitled “The Freedom of the Press,” he claimed that the British Communist Party, who had the copyright to this work, published a bowdlerized version of it, with the introduction removed. Notes for this book's publication were collected on assignment for the periodical The Masses, and its author had previously published a book of poems entitled Sangar: The Mad Recreant Knight of West. This work begins by discussing accusations levied by the Sisson Documents, which were the subject of a previous study, before the author devotes a chapter to the "Committee for Salvation." The end describes a meeting of the Congress of Peasants, after having documented the fall of the Provisional Government. This book lends its name to the full title of Sergei Eisenstein’s film, October. FTP, name this first-hand account of the Bolshevik Revolution by American socialist John Reed.

answer: {2666}

One character in this novel lectures on how he regaled his parole officer with tales of meeting Lin Biao, and claims that pork chops saved his life. Another section describes how many times words like “Paris,” “euphemism,” “American literature,” and “friendship” were used in two phone conversations. When a character reveals that he's a reporter for the Harlem magazine Black Dawn, he gets told that it's a fucked up name for a magazine. The brief appearance of investigator Albert Kessler sheds no light on the situation. The literature conference-hopping BFFs Piero Morini, Liz Norton, Jean-Claude Pelletier, and Manuel Espinoza appear in the section “The Part about the Critics,” one of its five books along with “The Part about Fate” and “The Part about Amalfitano.” The plot details numerous unsolved murders in Santa Teresa and gives the life story of mysterious German author Benno von Archimboldi. FTP, name this magnum opus by Roberto Bolaño, whose title may refer to a year in the future.

This document, together with a similar one authored by Viscount Cromer and a response to this document written by de Cuvelier, was published in the so-called “White Book.” This work’s author gave support to an organization founded by Edmund Morel dedicated to attacking “the King of the Beasts.” Its publication led Emile Vandervelde to push for an investigative commission. Part of this document describes imposition of a certain “tax” to be delivered in large baskets. All names in this document were reduced to single initials by Foreign Office censors. Among actions detailed in this document were the reported cutting off of testicles by soldiers to prove that they had killed a man, and cutting off hands in order to collect a bounty, as punishment for failing to meet the rubber harvest quota. Authored by a man later executed for attempting to garner German aid for the Easter Uprising, FTP, name this 1904 report submitted to the British Parliament on atrocities committed in the Belgian Congo.

One of the most extensive maps of this phenomenon has been produced using Zeeman interferometry by the Michelson Doppler Imager aboard the SOHO mission, while another method for mapping it relies on the Hanle effect. Some distance from its origin, this phenomenon divides into “open” and “closed” regions, and it undergoes large-scale adjustments on a timescale of days as a result of the formation and dissipation of supergranules. This phenomenon is transported by a meridional flow and by differential rotation, and as this phenomenon is transported outward from its origin by wind it forms a structure known as a Parker spiral. This is responsible for the dark color of objects whose polarity undergoes shifts in 11-year cycles. FTP, identify this phenomenon, a field induced by the dynamo process inside the star which we orbit.

answer: {production} functions (accept {Cobb-Douglas production} functions until " relationships ")

A paper by Anwar Sheikh critiques this relationship by showing how it could model a “humbug economy.” Joan Robinson’s analysis of this relationship with regard to the theory of capital gave rise to the aggregation and reswitching problems, which were the basis of the Cambridge Capital Controversy. The terms Hicks-neutral, Harrod-neutral, or Solow-neutral describe ways in which the choice of technique can be incorporated into these relationships. An isoquant family map can be implemented to find cost-minimizing optimizations for these kinds of relationships. Isoquants can also reveal whether these functions model increasing or decreasing returns to scale. Examples of them include the Leontief one and the Cobb-Douglas one. FTP, name these functions which relate capital and labor to output.

answer: {Rachmaninov’s 2nd} Symphony in {E Minor}, {Opus} 27 (Accept “{Second Symphony}”, “{Symphony No. 2}”, or “{Opus 27}” after {Rachmaninov} is mentioned)

Andre Previn’s 1973 recording of this work was one of the first not to observe the traditional cuts affecting the network of descending scales in the last movement. In the third movement, solos for the English horn and oboe are followed by a cadence in C major and a long silence. In the first movement, the basses and cellos introduce a motto theme that is subsequently played by the solo violin and clarinet. The scherzo starts with the violins accompanying an energetic French horn theme that begins E-A-G-A, while the transition to that movement’s B section is reminiscent of the one that sets up the saxophone solo in its composer’s Symphonic Dances. This work premiered over 10 years after the composer’s previous work in its genre, which had been ruined by the conducting of a drunk Alexander Glazunov. This work was written in Dresden, along with the tone poem The Isle of the Dead. FTP, identify this symphony by Sergei Rachmaninov.

answer: Kingdom of {Urartu}

The earliest known capitals of this kingdom were Arzashkun and Sugunia, which declined after the reign of King Aramu. The gods of this kingdom included Shiwini, Teisheba and Haldi, and a major event in their history was the sack of the Shrine of Haldi at Musasir, which led to suicide of their king Rusas I. The best known artifacts of this kingdom are their copper cauldrons decorated with bulls' heads, and their language was distantly related to Hurrian. Their greatest king was Sarduri II, whose encroachment southward at the expense of kings like Ashur-nirari V led to a brief overlordship of northern Mesopotamia, until they were defeated by Sargon II and Tiglath-Pileser III. FTP, name this kingdom of the early 1st millennium BCE centered around Lake Van, a powerful enemy of the Assyrians and the immediate predecessor of the kingdom of Armenia.

answer: {virial} equation of state

The coefficients of this equation in the limit of infinite volume are obtained by performing cluster integrals, a formalism extended to quantum systems by Kahn and Uhlenbeck. For a classical system, the second coefficient in this equation is typically evaluated by assuming the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential and integrating with respect to radius the quantity “one minus the negative exponent of the potential, times radius squared.” If the hard sphere potential is assumed instead, the result is identical to the van der Waals equation. This equation gives the product of pressure and volume per particle as a power series in the cube of the thermal wavelength over the volume per particle. FTP, identify this equation of state, an expansion whose namesake coefficients are functions of temperature.

answer: {Gauss-Markov} Theorem

In order to formally test one assumption of this theorem one can use the coefficients of determination in order to compute the variance inflation factor or the tolerance. Another important assumption of this theorem can be tested via the Breusch-Pagan or White tests, and ARCH modeling can be used to resolve that issue for time-series data. That issue, which violates one of the conditions of this theorem occurs when the variances differ among supposedly random variables and is known as heteroscedasticity. This theorem states that for homoscedastic and uncorrelated errors the mean squared error of the estimate will be lowest possible and the estimated coefficients will be described as BLUE. FTP, name this doubly-eponymous theorem from statistics which defines the validity of Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regressions.

This work’s first chapter contains an extended discussion of sensations of light, with reference to “photometric experiments,” and its conclusion argues that Kant was mistaken in believing that one of this work’s title concepts was homogenous. This work argues that equations represent something that is “already done,” and thus cannot represent motion, in a section that distinguishes between the qualitative and quantitative forms of multiplicity. The third chapter uses the thought example of a philosopher named Paul trying to predict the actions of a man named Peter, and concludes by arguing that determinism results from confusing two senses of the idea of “prefiguring,” and asserts that its second title concept is “real but indefinable.” FTP, name this work which contains an extended discussion of “duration,” the first major philosophical work by Henri Bergson.
