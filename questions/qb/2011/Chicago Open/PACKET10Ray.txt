answer: {Artaxerxes} ( {Artaserse} )

One ruler of this name defeated the revolt of Inaros by calling on his general Megabyzus, but drew the general's ire after consenting to his mother's demand to have Inaros executed. Another ruler of this name was victorious over Nectanebo II at the Battle of Pelusium, forcing Nectanebo's retreat to Memphis. The second king of this name met the Greek diplomat Antalcidas to negotiate a treaty that was dubbed the King's Peace, which ended the Corinthian War and gave this ruler the territories of Ionia and Cyprus. Earlier, that ruler rebuffed the invasion of his brother at the Battle of Cunaxa. The first one was referred to as "the Long Handed" and ascended to the throne by killing Artabanus, who'd killed his father. The last one to officially reign was succeeded by Darius III. FTP, give this name held by four Achaemenid kings of Persia, including the son of Xerxes I.

answer: {Time Reversal} Operator [accept equivalents, prompt on {CP} or {Charge Parity} before "{CP}" is mentioned, prompt on "{T}," prompt on "{Wigner's}" {operator} before mentioned]

Kramer's degeneracy theorem uses the effects of this operator on the electric field to show that systems with an odd number of electrons must remain doubly degenerate in the absense of a magnetic field. DORT makes use of this operator in scattering problems, while Wigner's theorem is typically used to conclude this operator is anti-unitary and so this is sometimes named for Wigner. Because it is non-increasing, Boltzmann's H-theorem would preclude the existance of this operator. Another result on this operator states that a process that lacks a certain symmetry cannot be made from processes that have it; that objection is named for Loschmidt. In any Lorentz invariant theory the symmetry of this operation is equivalent to the symmetries of charge and parity acting together according to the CPT theorem. FTP, name this process which could make a broken wineglass spontaneously reform.

answer: William S. {Burroughs}

One of this author's title characters has the Supreme Court sodomized by a “purple assed-baboon” with the aid of “Jerk Off Annie,” who is appointed “Chief of Staff.” The narrator of another work has an encounter with Norton, a soldier for whom he occasionally fences submachine guns. In addition to writing letters like “Roosevelt After Inauguration,” he described the post-apocalyptic misadventures of youths at Penny Arcade Peep-Shows in his Wild Boys. Brion Gysin's razor blade inspired a style this man perfected in a trilogy about time-traveling secret agents battling evil Mayans and the mind-controlling “Nova Mob,” including such works as The Ticket That Exploded. This popularizer of the “cut-up” technique described escape from the nefarious Doc Benway and Hassan's liquefactionist orgy in Interzone in a work that shares themes with his other books Queer and Junkie.

answer: {The Turn of the Screw}

The first scene of this work’s second act ends with a character asking, “Lost in my labyrinth, which way shall I turn?” In an earlier scene, another character rattles off a list of third-declension masculine nouns, some of which he reuses in a mock Benedicite on the way to church. Each scene of this work is preceded by a variation on its main theme, whose tone row consists of alternating fourths and minor thirds. One character in this work is characteristically accompanied by a celesta, and calls another character’s name by means of a repeated descending tetrachord. That boy soprano character also sings a rhyme about an apple tree, a naughty boy, and other possible translations of the Latin word “malo.” This work ends with a solo for the Governess after another character shouts “Peter Quint, you devil!” For 10 points, name this opera by Benjamin Britten, based on a Henry James work about Flora and Miles.

answer: Albert {Ellis}

This man pitted his psychological methods against Fritz Perls and a leading Humanistic theorist in a series of sessions with a single mother, the “Gloria Tapes.” His bombastic persona was enhanced by his regular Friday Night public therapy sessions and numerous post-Kinsey works like Sex without Guilt, and he popularized the MMPI on the East Coast while practicing without actually having a doctorate. His major work relies on Korzybski's General Semantics, inspired the work of Aaron Beck, and drew from sources like Epictetus as described in his book How To Live with a Neurotic. That system of his relies on restructuring of damaging internal constructs and was advocated over behaviorism and psychoanalysis by this man. FTP, name this early cognitive-behaviorist who authored Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy and created Rational-Emotive Therapy.

During this period, Catholic priest Christian von Wernich was prosecuted for doing a bunch of nefarious shit after repeal of the Full Stop Law. David Rockefeller gave millions from Chase Manhattan for de Hoz's National Reorganization Process during this period, which was presaged by attacks on Ford and Fiat plants. Ford Falcons became a symbol of oppression and Jacobo Timerman's La Opinion became the leading voice of dissent during this time, which saw the “Night of the Pencils,” an action which targeted university students. This period saw a purging of Montoneros from the Justicialist Party, and its most notable actions were carried out by the SIDE between 1976 and 1983.

The chief architects of these events were the head of TG4 and a regional People of Freedom leader and member of the dental industry. A figure known as “Ilda the Red” charged that many participants in these events were issued official police uniforms, while their exposure was triggered by an unrelated series of calls to a police station which purported to identify a relative of Hosni Mubarak. The Bloomsbury Dreadnought hoax, a nickname of Sabina Begen, and a suggestion of Muammar Gaddafi have all been posited as explanations for the name of these events, the most famous of which involved Karima El Mahroug, better known as Ruby Rubacuori.

answer: Lysine

The injectable NSAID Caldolor is marketed as a replacement for a similar drug, Neoprofen, that combines ibuprofen with this compound, a derivative of which can treat toxicity due to tPA and streptokinase since it inhibits plasmin and other proteins that bind at its residue; that drug, Amicar, is often used to arrest bleeding after clot-busting therapies. It decarboxylates into everyone's favorite putrefaction diamine, cadaverine, and condenses with alpha-ketoglutarate into saccharopine. Ubiquitin tags proteins for assassination with the help of seven residues of this amino acid; those residues are also frequent targets for methylation during imprinting along with a similarly basic amino acid, arginine. A hydroxylated form of it is added along with proline between glycine residues with the aid of vitamin C during collagen synthesis. For 10 points, identify this amino acid symbolized K.

answer: {Sozaboy} : A Novel in Rotten English

This work's protagonist occasionally illustrates the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis via his characteristically list-based thinking, resorting to “plus” for each new item once he reaches five. A few key scenes include an assault after the protagonist's friend steals a bottle of whiskey from a man they later lure to his death, and an encounter with the main character's love interest, Agnes, at the Upvine Bar. The work ends with the narrator fleeing his former neighbors, who plan to axe-murder him to death for being a ghost. It opens with the darkly ironic observation that “everyone in Dukana was happy at first.” This book was reprinted with its author's final speech, which proclaims “we all stand before history,” attached after a glossary which explains that “making pepper” and “knacking tory” denotes getting angry and gossiping. Focusing on the naïve Mene's delusions of masculinity and drawing from its author's experience in the Biafran War, FTP, name this novel about the title conscripted Nigerian, a work in “rotten English” which is the best known piece of Ken Sara-Wiwa.

Following the conclusion of this action, Rufus Saxton was unable to implement his key administrative project. Prisoners were forced to clear makeshift explosive “torpedoes” by Kilpatrick's vanguard during this action, which relied on four parallel routes partially chosen to deny autonomy to H.W. Slocum. The plans for this effort mandated “discriminating between the rich. . . and the poor” and outlined the division between foraging and theft. After this action's success, the “Christmas gift” telegram was sent and Special Field Order No. 15 partitioned land into 40-acre tracts. This action led to the creation of some namesake “neckties” out of bent railway rails. Ending with the capture of Savannah, FTP, name this 1864 campaign in which a Union General departed Atlanta and scorched some Confederate earth en route to the coast.

answer: {Hashing} functions [prompt on " {checksum} " before mention]

In 1979, Carter and Wegman removed the assumption these mappings input have a random distribution when they introduced “universal families” of these functions. If the pre-image of these mappings contains a binary representation of a message’s length, then these exhibit Merkle and Damgard strengthening. One approach to implementing these mappings interprets the target structure as an array of “buckets.” Common algorithms for these functions are known as the midsquare and the division methods. To solve the most common issue of these mappings, one could employ linear probe open addressing or chaining to resolve collisions when different values return the same result. FTP, name these functions that convert large amounts of data into one small value or checksum, as when they map a search key to an index of the similarly-named table.

One of this thinker's essays concludes that art-criticism is the key to understanding Plato and Hegel, and consists mostly of commentary on Shakespeare's use of costumes to achieve “illusion.” Another essay concludes that “the new Individualism is the new Hellenism.” This author of The Truth in Masks and The Soul of Man Under Socialism used the character Gilbert to laud contemplation as necessary for creation of great art. In another work, a shared love of cigarettes and Nature leads to veneration of "art for art's sake" by Cyril and Vivian. He noted the immortality of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in a work concluding that Nature will “with bitter herbs make me whole." That work references this author's dialogues The Critic as Artist and The Decay of Lying.

This author rebuked a surrealist idol after the death of Zavis Kalandra in his “In Memoria Paul Eluard,” and traced his infatuation with neologisms to Holderlin's beloved “pallaksch” in the poem “Tubingen, January.” This author of The No-One's Rose mused on the voices of Buchner characters in his “Meridian” speech.
