answer: {Goliards} (accept The {Wandering Scholars} before it's mentioned)

One member of this movement authored the Mirror of Fools, which was based upon The Golden Ass by Apuleius. The name of this movement comes from a spurious poem which describes the "lion of the apocalypse" – that poem is narrated by Pythagoras and tells of the opening of seven seals. Helen Waddel wrote a monograph on these figures, which traces their break with pagan tradition beginning with Ausonius. This group included Hugh Primas, who was jokingly called "Hugh the Primate," and Walter of Chantillon. Another member wrote a poem in which he describes his resolve to “die in a tavern." - that one was referred to as the "Arch-Poet." FTP, name these "wandering scholars" of the middle ages, who authored the Carmina Burana, and other Latin poetry aimed at lampooning the Catholic Church.

answer: {Algernon Swinburne}

This author described the title "philosopher and martyr" as "son of the lightning and the light that glows / beyond the lightning's or the morning's light" in his "For the Feast of Giordano Bruno." He used a double sestina to recast the seventh novel of the Decameron in his poem "The Complaint of Lisa." He mused "Clearly the soul is the body: but is not the body the soul?" in a work that ends "Fiddle, we know, is diddle: and diddle, we take it is dee" - that work is his 26-line response to an Alfred Tennyson poem entitled "The Higher Pantheism in a Nutshell." His interest in Thomas Mallory inspired the book-length Tristram of Lyonesse. He mused "Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of gold / a bitter God to follow, a beautiful God to behold?" in a work that begins "I have lived long enough,  having seen one thing, that love hath an end." The author of that Hymn to Proserpina, FTP, name this decadent poet who wrote an elegy for Charles Baudelaire with his "Ave Atque Vale."

answer: {creep strain}

The dislocation, or power-law, type of this phenomenon occurs when line defects move through a solid crystal in a stepwise slip fashion; those dislocations may climb or glide past microstructural obstacles.  This phenomenon can be modeled using the Larson-Miller or Sherby-Dorn time-temperature parameters.  For polymers, the effects of this process increase dramatically as temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature.  The Nabarro-Herring type of this process occurs when point defects diffuse through a crystal lattice.  Another type of this phenomenon in crystalline structures, named after Coble, occurs when vacancies move along grain boundaries.  FTP, identify this phenomenon, a type of physical deformation that occurs gradually over time, and shares its name with a type of mass wasting contrasted with saltation.

answer: {Sneferu} (or {Soris}, {Snofru}, {Seneferu})

On the orders of Neferirkare, this ruler's sanctuary was decorated by a statue of the god Ihy. His eldest son, the vizier Ankhhaf, was depicted in a bust now held at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. His main wife was his sister Hetepheres I, who was given the title "Daughter of God," and this ruler's mother Meresankh seems to have been a wife of his predecessor Huni. He constructed the Red Pyramid, also called the North Pyramid, named for the color of the stones beneath its casing. His campaigns into Libya produced a large quantity of cedar wood and prisoners. This first member of the Fourth Dynasty likely also built a pyramid at Meidum, but he's better known for a project at Dahshur which seems to have suffered structural damage, resulting in a 43-degree incline at the upper half. FTP, name this father of Cheops, who constructed the infamous Bent Pyramid.

answer: {The Stones of Venice}

This work contains a footnote in which the author expresses his disdain for the Protestant opinion toward relics, writing that “Elisha once trusted his own staff too far.” One chapter illustrates the idea of rigidity by defining it as “the peculiar energy which gives tension its movement” - rigidity is one of six "moral elements" presented by the author along with redundance, changefulness, savageness, naturalism, and grotesqueness. That discussion occurs in the second volume, which is subtitled "The Sea-Stories" - a reference to the lowest floor in a building. The first volume discusses qualities like “The Angle” and “The Quarry,” in the course of delineating “The Six Divisions of Architecture.” Other portions study the Ducal Palace, the Bridge of Sighs, and the Grand Canal. FTP, name this three volume treatise concerning a title Italian city by John Ruskin.

answer: {international trade}

A recent paper about this economic phenomenon by "Arkolakis et al" calculates that welfare gains associated with it are surprisingly low, and uniform across alternative models of it. The Eaton-Kortum-style models of this phenomenon show a constant elasticity of this quantity with respect to distance, proportional to the scale parameter of the Frechet distribution from which firm-level unit costs are drawn. Recent models of this phenomenon, such as those proposed by Melitz and Chaney, include fixed costs of market entry to create an extensive margin, which explains the large number of zero observations in firm-level data. All models of this economic phenomenon give rise to a “gravity equation,” which predicts that magnitude of flows increases with size of the two parties to this phenomenon, and diminishes with distance. Also described by the Hecksher-Olin model, FTP, name this phenomenon which happens when countries export goods in which they have a comparative advantage.

In this novel, the revealing of a portrait with a black curtain over it leads to a digression about the disappearance of Lady Laurentini after she'd walked into the woods. The protagonist is frightened when St. Elmo's Fire glows on a halberd of a soldier bought out by a condottiero. Near the beginning, the protagonist's mother dies followed by her father, and the latter asks her to return home to La Vallee to burn his papers. Annette and her lover Ludovico assist the main character at the title place. The facade between Madame Cheron and her suitor, the villain Montoni, dissolves at the climax, and the main character is free to marry Vallancourt. FTP, name this novel about Emily St. Aubert and her investigation of the title castle, a work by Ann Radcliffe.

answer: Baron Antoine-Jean {Gros} [or {Jean-Antoine Gros} ]

This artist attempted to return to his earlier style with such paintings as Cupids Stung by a Bee and Hercules and Diomedes, whose bad reception led to this man's death by drowning. He delivered a dramatic oration at the funeral of his friend Girodet, whose death inspired his change in style. A man in green crouches at the feet of a horse in his painting of the aftermath of a winter battle, while another canvas shows a nude black man trampled by an oncoming army. This artist of The Battle of Aboukir showed his patron in The Battle of Eylau holding a flag on the bridge of Arcole. He's best known for a canvas showing a commander touching a sick man at the plague house in Jaffa. FTP, name this French Neo-Classicist who made his reputation on heroic paintings of Napoleon in the early 1800s.

answer: {protostars}

Lada and Wilking used the spectral energy distribution and the luminosity of these entities to classify them into four classes in 1984. The spectral lines of these entities that are near the upper limit of their mass are very similar to Herbig emissions. That upper bound on these objects is governed by a single-term expression raising big G to the 2/3 power and multiplying by the constant 1.18 and is known as the Bonnor-Ebert mass. Beyond that limit, these entities are governed by the Jeans instability, where gravitational collapse proceeds. These entities are surrounded by so-called cocoon nebulae because of their accretion discs, which tend to eject infrared radiation, as opposed to x-rays. These entities take the Hayashi track to the Henyey track, where they join the main-sequence after they stop accumulating mass. FTP, name this early stage in star formation.

answer: {Westminster Abbey}

The first history of this institution was written by Sulcard, while another history of it by John Flete claims that it was founded by King Lucius in 184 AD. This institution released a number of forged charters drafted by Osbert of Clare, who served under its head Gervasius, a man whose name is inscribed at a grave here known as the "Long Meg." Francis Millen spearheaded a scheme to plant bombs in this building in 1887, which was called the Jubilee Plot. A forged 1139 bull of Innocent II enjoined the head of this institution not to alienate property without consent of its members. Originally located on Thorney Island, it was targeted by the Injunctions of Thomas Cromwell, which sought to remove its immunity from secular law, and four years later it was dissolved. FTP, name this Benedictine foundation of Edward the Confessor, who created it to serve as a mausoleum for the royal family.

answer: Tristan {Tzara}

In one work, this author defends a movement he dubs "the abolition of logic," "the abolition of memory," "the abolition of archaeology" and "the abolition of the future." A play by him sees characters speak "Of angels in helicopters," "angels of conversation," "angels in cushions" and "angels in ice." He asserts that "our faces are formless like the stars" in a work set "where ... the flowers of the clocks catch fire." In addition to that poem "The Great Lament of My Obscurity Three" and his poem "The Approximate Man," this author included the line "This will end with a lovely marriage" as the final line to his play in which an Ear, Eyebrow, Mouth, Eye, Neck, and Nose are the only characters brought on stage. FTP, name this author of The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine and the play The Gas Heart, who was born in Romania and closely associated with Dadaism.

answer: {Dubrovnik} (or Ragusa before that word is {said}, or {Argosy})

This city witnessed an earthquake in 1667, which caused turmoil amongst its aristocracy - the Sorgi remained its principal family, but all of its key buildings were leveled except the Rector Palace and the Sponza Palace. This city became a prosperous semi-independent republic after it was acquired under the Treaty of Zadar in 1358 by Louis I of Hungary. A legend holds that St. Blaise appeared to a local priest in a dream here, and stopped a siege of this city in 948 CE. Fort Bokar and the Plia Gate are a part of the giant stone walls that encircle this maritime city, originally designed to stave off Ottoman attack. Known as the Republic of Ragusa in the 14th century, this city saw another siege when it was shelled by Serbian bombers in 1991. FTP, name this city on the Dalmatian coast, a hotspot for tourists, which is found across its namesake isthmus at the southern tip of Croatia.

answer: The {Cheese} and the {Worms} (or {Il Formaggio e} i {Vermi})

In one chapter of this work, the central figure is asked "Who moves the chaos?" to which he responds "It moves by itself." The preface to the English edition of this work puts forth the author's thesis that, between the culture of the dominant and subordinate classes, there existed a "circular relationship of reciprocal influences, which travelled from low to high as well as from high to low" - a proposal for which the author cites Mikhail Bakhtin. Another section chronicles the reading of John Mandeville's travels, and draws on research of the Benandanti witches, which the author also utilized in his later book The Night Battles. The main character claims that angels appeared in a mass created from a mixture earth, air, fire, and water - for this opinion that the world arose from putrefaction, Scandella is questioned by the Roman inquisition. FTP, name this microhistory about the 16th century miller Menocchio, the masterwork of Carlo Ginzburg.

answer: {bone morphogenic} proteins (accept {BMPs}; {also} accept {osteogenic proteins} or {OPs})

The presence of types 2 and 4 of this family of proteins, in combination with Wnt inhibition, induces expression of NKX-2.5 to determine cardiac mesoderm.  Except for type 1, which is a metalloprotease, these proteins are a type of TGF-beta-related protein.  When activated, their receptors phosphorylate Smads 1, 5, and 8.  Prior to neurulation, signalling from type 4 of these proteins stimulates development of the anterior visceral endoderm.  The neural plate develops when one type of these proteins is inhibited by factors secreted from the primitive node, including folistatin and chordin.  In infants, fontanelle closure is delayed when one of these proteins is inhibited by noggin.  FTP, identify this family of signalling proteins which induce the development of cartilage and another namesake connective tissue.

During this man’s reelection campaign, a heckler shouted “You old anarchist!” during one of his speeches, to which he replied “Our friend has had sixteen and one,” a reference to the monetary policy he championed. A biography of this political figure entitled Eagle Forgotten by Harry Barnard describes how he nearly bankrupted himself building the Unity Block project, funded with money from John Walsh. He wrote a book about the Bridewell correctional facility, where over 95 percent of the inmates were serving time for non-payment of petty fines. That work is Our Penal Machinery and Its Victims, and late in life he was a law partner to Clarence Darrow.

These figures represent the critics of the poet Callimachus in his "Aitia" - where he says that they do not know how to rot their own liver, know nothing of poetry and hate the Muses. At one point, they use weapons like a giant fir tree, and a cornel with trunk and roots attached - when they join Dionysius in a war against the Indians. In some sources, they're led by Demonax, and Ovid claims that they mix sulphur with Stygian water to destroy plant and animal life. Sometimes given the names Lykos, Skelmis, and Damnameneus - they're often depicted with flippers and heads of dogs, and they hail from the island of Rhodes. Their magic created the sickle that castrated Saturn, and created the trident of Poseidon, but it's often said that they grew malignant and Zeus drowned them beneath the waves.

In the introduction to Principia Ethica, GE Moore wrote that this thinker was the ethical writer whose opinions most closely resembled his own, except that this man wrongly denied the "principle of organic unities." This man and his students' concept of "intrinsic value" was studied in two book length works by Roderick Chisholm, the foremost modern interpreter of this man's work. This author of The Origin of Our Ideas of Right and Wrong argued that mental phenomena are the main features of "inner perception." With his student Alexius Meinong, he championed the concept of "inner value," a theory expounded on in his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint, which inspired the formation of Gestalt.  FTP, name this German thinker who formulated a concept of directed mental states which he called "intentionality," and who's also known for teaching Edmund Husserl.
