answer: {reversible} process[{accept} word forms]

Christodoulou showed that these do not increase the area of a black hole's event horizon. The Markov
 type of these must have detailed balance and Crook's fluctuation theorem applies to dynamics with the
 microscopic form. They have no dissipative effects and no temperature gradients transporting heat,
 therefore no spontaneous occurrence has this property. Carnot's theorem applies to engines that have the
 property of these processes. Each point in these processes are in continuous equilibrium. For 10 points,
 name these processes that permit returning the system to its original state after performing the process.

answer: The {World} as {Will} and {Idea} [or The {World} as {Will} and {Representation}; or The {World} as {Will}

The author’s meeting with Friedrich Majer is believed to have inspired this text, whose second book
 notes that the trajectory of a bullet and the inner workings of the brain are just as incomprehensible. One
 section of this text describes how individuation only gives rise to violence with the example of the bulldog
 ant, which attacks itself when cut in half. This work argues that every action comprises two aspects: an
 interior "blind striving," and an exterior objectification of that striving. Inspired by the Upanishads, this
 work rejects Kantian ethics for its dismissal of inner experiences, or what he referred to as the thing in
 itself. For 10 points, name this work by Arthur Schopenhauer.

answer: manganese

Arginase, an enzyme used in the final step of the urea cycle, contains this metal. A certain compound
 containing both potassium and this metal is known as Condy’s crystal and in organic chemistry is used as
 an alternative to osmium tetroxide in a basic solution to convert an alkene to a 1,2-diol, or as an alternative
 to chromium-based complexes to react an alcohol to a carboxylic acid. The oxygen evolving complex in
 chloroplasts has a center with calcium and this metal. In the body, this metal is paired with iron in a class of
 superoxide dismutase found in the mitochondria. This metal is central to the testing of alkenes in Baeyer’s
 reagent, which involves the reduction of its +7 oxidation state to its +2 oxidation state. For 10 points, name
 this transition metal with chemical symbol Mn.

Joseph Anderson's use of a fifty-strong battalion of armed guards allowed the Tredegar Iron Works to
 survive this event, which began shortly after Richard Ewell concentrated all available tobacco in certain
 buildings. News of it was leaked to the public early when caches of government documents were spotted in

answer: {GABA} [or {gamma}-{aminobutyric acid}]

This molecule is released by climbing fiber activation of Purkinje cells, and Huntington’s disease is
 partially caused by the loss of cells that secrete this substance in the striatum. It is produced in a reaction
 that uses the enzymes GAD and pyridoxal phosphate, or vitamin B6 and its receptor works by widening a
 chloride channel, which in turn neutralizes norepinephrine. Benzodiazepenes and barbituates work by
 binding to receptors for this molecule, which is synthesized by decarboxylating glutamate. For 10 points,

 work quotes several times after the repeated phrase "but on the contrary." Natural Law is described in the
 second portion of this work, in which a videtur, sed contra, and responsio comprise an article, many of

answer: {central limit} theorem

The amount of error created by applying this theorem to intermediate values is the subject of the
 Berry-Esseen theorem. The Cramer-Wold theorem can be used to generalize this in a multivariate manner.
 The de Moivre-Laplace theorem is a special case of this. One statement of this is named for Feller and
 Lindeberg and this is true when Lyapunov's condition holds. A rule of thumb resulting from this is that one
 should have a minimum of 30 in a sample when the population is non-Gaussian. When sampling, this
 theorem implies a distribution with standard deviation sigma over square root n. For 10 points, name this
 theorem that implies as sample sizes get larger, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal
 distribution.
