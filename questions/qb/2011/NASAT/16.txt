answer: attack on {Pearl Harbor}

One captured combatant in this battle attempted to burn himself with cigarettes to commit suicide.
 Kermit Tyler was responsible for warning one side of the approach of the other. This battle, which was
 known as Operation Z by one side, was prompted by the passage of the Vinson-Walsh act and the sending
 of the Hull Note by one country. The attacking side made heavy use of the recently-developed Type 91
 torpedo. The aggressor was partly motivated by dwindling oil supplies. This battle saw the destruction of
 the USS Arizona. Occurring on "a date which will live in infamy," for 10 points, name this attack that
 brought the United States into World War II.

answer: Crito

In this work, the main speaker refers to education as a doctrine of the multitude which has little regard
 for the life or death of a single individual. Earlier, when one character is told of a ship arriving from Delos,
 he responds by describing a dream in which a woman in white tells him he will go to Phthia in three days.
 That man is later reminded of the wealthy friends Simmias and Cebes, along with allies he has in Thessaly.
 The main subject notes that responding to one injustice with another injustice is just as wrong. Towards the
 end of this work, the protagonist notes that he has been educated and nurtured by his city and thus escaping
 after breaking the rules would violate the contract he has entered with his government. For 10 points, name
 this Platonic dialogue in which Socrates turns down a friend’s offer to escape from prison.

answer: Diocletian

To become emperor, he won the Battle of Margus after his predecessor, Carus, was struck by lightning.
 In one story, this emperor was asked to return to the throne but decided he was happier living as a cabbage
 farmer at his palace in Split. Rapid inflation prompted him to introduce a coin called the argenteus and
 establish price controls with his Edict on Maximum Prices. He is remembered for allegedly martyring
 20,000 people at Nicomedia, an action later outlawed by Constantine’s Edict of Milan. He and his
 co-emperors Maximian, Galerius, and Constantius each ruled one quarter of the empire in a system called
 the Tetrarchy. For 10 points, name this Roman emperor noted for persecuting Christians.

answer: {capillaries} [or blood vessels before "{Clarkson’s disease}" is read; prompt after]

In Henoch-Schonlein pupura, these structures in the skin are attacked by antibodies, and these structures
 become excessively permeable in Clarkson’s disease. Pericytes are responsible for regulating these
 structures within the brain. One type of these lack pinocytotic vesicles and are only found in the liver,
 known as the sinusoidal type, which is a specific version of the fenestrated type. An equation describing
 these entities contains the reflection and filtration coefficients and shows the balance between hydrostatic
 and oncotic pressure; that equation is named for Starling. They contain a single layer of endothelial cells,
 and glomeruli of the kidney are balls of them. In the lungs, O2 from the alveoli move into these structures,
 beds of which exchange nutrients and waste with body tissues. For 10 points, name this class of blood
 vessels, the body's smallest.

answer: {Henry’s} Law

Benson and Krause developed a 3-term power series for accurately finding the coefficients in this law.
 The constants found in this law are often found using solid-phase microextraction, and the reciprocal of one
 of those constants gives the partition coefficient of the reaction in question. This law, which can be applied
 to silicate melts in geology, is only applicable in the limit of infinite dilution and only applies to ideal
 solutions. Stated as p equals k c, this law explains why soda goes flat when left out too long and why divers
 get decompression sickness. For 10 points, name this law from chemistry which states that the amount of
 gas that will dissolve in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas.

answer: {Bobo Doll} Experiment

In a follow-up to this experiment, wives recorded the helpful behavior of their husbands. This
 experiment and later variations helped disprove the Freudian idea of the catharsis effect and showed that
 vicarious reinforcement could be as important as direct reinforcement in learning. Some confederates in
 this study were given a soft drink and told they were “strong champions” while others were warned that
 they were “a big bully” after performing the central action. Friedrich and Stein reversed this experiment to
 look at the positive effects of watching episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Children in this
 experiment were shown a film in which adults yelled things like “sockeroo!” and “pow, right in the nose!”
 For 10 points, name this experiment conducted by Albert Bandura where children repeated aggressive

answer: supernovae

A project at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics headed by Brian Schmidt searches for high-redshift
 examples of these objects in order to use their light curves as tests of the expanding universe. Two subtypes
 of these objects are distinguished by their absence of a strong silicon line and by serving as radio sources.
 These objects are classified into two broad categories depending on whether or not they exhibit hydrogen
 spectra, and the relatively uniform brightnesses of one subtype of these objects allow them to be used to
 calculate the distance ladder. A white dwarf which exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit will become the Type
 Ia [read: “one-A”] variety of this object, and the Type II variety of these objects form from massive stars
 when a collapsing core initiates further burning of successive interior layers. For ten points, identify these
 powerful explosions that occur at the end of a star’s life cycle.
