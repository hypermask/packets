answer: integration by {parts}

Driver improved upon Bismut's version of this formula for jump processes. Darboux's formula is a
 consequence of its repeated application and Abel's formula is its analogous discrete method. It can be
 derived by using the product rule on two functions then applying the fundamental theorem of calculus and
 rearranging terms. One variant of takes the products of a item in a table with the item to its lower right then
 sums the products using alternating signs. That tabular method is used when this is done repeatedly. The
 LIATE rule is a heuristic for using it where L stands for logarithm and I for inverse trig function. For 10
 points, name this integration technique that states that the integral of u dv equals uv minus the integral of v
 du.

The introduction to one of this man's works discusses the execution of the regicide Robert-Francois
 Damiens. This thinker developed the method of "genealogy" to show that modernity’s episteme was not
 “rationally inevitable.” This writer also attempted to trace the origins of the "repressive hypothesis" and the
 concept of "biopower" in another work. This author analyzed the "medical gaze" in The Birth of the Clinic
 in addition to writing The History of Sexuality. Another of his works describes how Bentham's Panopticon

One stretch of this river flows through a volcanic region called the Singu Plateau. A series of seven
 controversial dams are planned for construction on this river, the largest of which is the Myitsone dam. The
 Taping and Chindwin are tributaries of this river which is formed by the confluence of the Mali and N’mai
 rivers. This river is also home to and names a certain type of beakless dolphin that shares many physical
 features with the beluga whale. The delta of the Salween River lies about one hundred miles east of the

answer: {lasers} [or light {amplification} by stimulated emission of radiation before "{stimulated}"]

A sine squared factor in the denominator of the gain-saturation function for these devices causes "spatial
 hole burning" in the gain coefficient. That gain coefficient is equal to a threshold value in
 "continuous-wave oscillation" of these devices, in which the cavity photon number is constant. These
 devices make use of a deviation from thermal equilibrium in which there are more electrons in a higher
 energy level than a lower energy level, a phenomenon known as population inversion, though ones that
 work without population inversion do so using quantum coherence. For 10 points, name these devices that
 produce highly coherent light through stimulated emission of radiation.

answer: {auxin}

Overexpression of YUCCA genes increase the synthesis of these compounds by increasing
 hydroxylation of tryptamine, and another step of their synthesis is catalyzed by nitrilase. The toxin
 fusicoccin mimics some of the effects of these compounds, which binds to the TIR1-SCF complex. They
 trigger increased efflux of protons across the cell wall, causing the activation of expansins; that mechanism
 is known as the acid-growth hypothesis. This hormone moves from shoots downward in a process known
 as polar transport, and it helps establish apical dominance. Experiments with blocks of agar also showed
 that its responsible for phototropism. For 10 points, name this plant hormone, examples of which include
 indole-3-acetic acid.

Clerical involvement in this era was criticized in books like Backwards Christ. Norman Bailey claimed
 an intimidation tactic in this era was to replace fetuses with roosters. One phase of this period saw a decree
 repeal the 1930 labor laws and tacit government endorsement of violence against Protestant churches. The
 chaos of this period led to one group forming the Marquetalia Republic after it was ended by a sixteen-year
 power-sharing agreement. The assassination of Jorge Eliecer Gaitan sparked its earliest phase, the
 Bogotazo, and tens of thousands died in liberal-conservative clashes. For 10 points, name this 1948 to 1964
