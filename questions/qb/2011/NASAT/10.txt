answer: {elliptical} galaxies [prompt on {galaxies}]

Alvio Renzini developed a diagnostic for these objects formation. A large one of these in the Virgo
 Cluster is M87. Certain parameters describing these are constrained by the fundamental plane. Type II
 supernova have not been observed to occur in these. The brightness of these objects is characterized by De
 Vaucouleur’s Law. The velocity dispersion and luminosity of these are related by the Faber–Jackson
 relation. They are measured on a scale that runs from zero to seven. These objects tend to have little star
 formation because of the lack of interstellar matter, and are composed of old stars with low mass. They can
 be classified according to the ratio of their major and minor axes. For 10 points, name these galaxies which
 are neither lenticular nor spiral.

answer: Duchenne {Muscular Dystrophy} or {DMD}

One sign of this disease is patients’ use of the Gowers maneuver. A recent therapy for this disease
 involves oligonucleotide-mediated exon-skipping. A similar condition caused by a less-damaging mutation
 in the same gene as this disease is named for Becker. Blood levels of creatine kinase are very high in this
 disease, which also causes dilated cardiomyopathy without heart failure. The gene mutated in this disease
 has 79 exons, and patients exhibit pseudohypertrophy and eventual respiratory failure. The gene central to
 this disease, dystrophin, is located on the X-chromosome, and its mutation leads to wasting and loss of the
 ability to walk. For 10 points, name this X-linked genetic disorder which causes muscle wasting.

Charles Alkan published a set of these pieces as his opus 31, which includes one nicknamed "The Song
 of the Mad Woman on the Sea Shore." Jascha Heifetz popularized his own violin transcriptions of the three
 pieces written in this form by Gershwin. Examples of this form by Debussy include "What the West Wind
 Has Seen" and "Footsteps in the Snow." Chopin's Opus 28 consists of twenty-four of these pieces,
 including the fourth in E-minor, which was played at his funeral, and the fifteenth, which is known as the
 "Raindrop." Bach paired each of his twenty four fugues with one of these works in The Well-Tempered
 Clavier, and Rachmaninoff built his reputation on one in G minor and one in C sharp minor. For 10 points,

answer: {acetic} acid [or {acetate}]

An iodinated version of this compound is used to reduce disulfide bridges during protein sequencing
 and to inhibit cysteine proteases. Its trifloro- version is a commonly used mobile phase in peptide HPLC.
 One process used to produce this process must suppress both the water-gas shift reaction and the
 production of propionic acid; that process uses an Iridium-III catalyst to carbonylate methanol. The
 anhydrous version of this compound is referred to as “glacial”, and methods to produce it include the
 Cativa and Monsanto process. This substance is created by bacteria when ethanol is oxidized twice in a
 fermentation-type process. For 10 points, name this substance with formula CH3COOH, an organic acid

answer: {superfluidity}

One useful model of these substances posited that they contain two components, one of which carries
 all the entropy; that model was posited by Tisza. One hallmark of these substances is the fact that a
 pressure gradient has no effect on their motion, and it is also impossible to maintain a thermal gradient
 across one of these substances. Substances with this property can produce Rollin films, and when
 temperature is applied on one side of a porus plug, these substances will product jets. Landau won the
 Nobel Prize for his work on these substances, which only exist below the lambda point. Common
 substances of this type include very cold helium-3 and helium-4, and they creep out of the sides of their
 containers. For 10 points, name these substances with zero viscosity.
