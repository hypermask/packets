answer: {strong} nuclear force/interaction

In the study of this force, the Bjorken scaling helped find the dependence of the structure function in the
 large angle deflection of electrons in deep inelastic scattering. This led to the parton model. With long
 wavelengths, particles that interact via this force have a full Yukawa cloud, but for short wavelengths, this
 force vanishes. In a vacuum below .2 GeV, a condensate of particles that interact via this force can form.
 Separating two particles that interact via this force that has asymptotic freedom requires infinite energy.
 Gluons carry this force that confines colors, which means only hadrons can be seen and not the constituent
 particles. For 10 points, name this force that holds quarks together in the protons and neutrons, as opposed
 to the weak force.

answer: linear {momentum} [{do not accept "angular momentum"}]

In quantum mechanics, the Fourier transform of this quantity's operator is represented by the position
 operator, and this quantity's operator is equal to negative i times h bar times the gradient. Translation
 invariance of the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian implies conservation of this quantity, which is equal to the
 product of h bar and the wave number for a photon. It is conserved in both elastic and inelastic collisions,
 and its change in a given time interval is the impulse. Its time derivative is equal to the product of mass and
 acceleration by Newton's Second Law. For 10 points, identify this product of mass and velocity.

answer: {iconoclasm}

The man who implemented this policy defended it by claiming a recent eruption of the island of Thera
 showed God’s wrath. Artabasdus seized power to end this policy, but was overthrown and blinded when
 Constantine retook control. This policy was supported at the Council of Hieria, which prompted the Syrian
 monk John of Damascus to attack it. It was partially implemented to curtail the influence of Germanus, and
 it was defended by Empress Irene. It began when a cross was placed over the Chalke Gate at
 Constantinople. For 10 points, name this policy implemented by Leo III, in which pictures of saints were

Ferroxyl solution is prepared by adding sodium chloride, potassium hexacyanoferranate, and this
 substance to water, and when bonded to two extra hydrogen atoms it contains a benzene ring fused to a
 gamma-lactone. Fluorescin has a higher quantum yield than this molecule due to an additional bridging
 oxygen, and its most notable property occurs when one of its benzene rings twists out of plane with respect
 to the other two. When mixed with bromothymol blue, thymol blue, and methyl red, it forms a universal
 indicator. For 10 points, name this chemical which turns pink in basic solutions and orange in acidic ones.

Some members of this class remain stationary with the help of byssal threads. The species Crassostrea
 gigas in this class introduced the parasite MSX to a closely related species. When this class of animals first
 evolved, they outcompeted and almost entirely replaced a phylum of similar-looking animals called
 brachiopods. These animals often feed by using elongated siphons to filter water. These animals have an
 open circulatory system with hemolymph, and like other members of their phylum they move using a single

 intermediate. Coenzyme Q is responsible for transferring substrates to the cytochrome bc1 complex in this
 process, which then transfers those substrates to cytochrome c oxidase. Peter Mitchell showed that this

 and FADH2 from the Krebs cycle feed into this process, which occurs on the inner membrane of the
 mitochondria. For 10 points, name this final step of oxidative phosphorylation in which 32 ATP are
