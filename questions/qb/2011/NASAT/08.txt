answer: {identity} element [or {identity} function; or {identity map}]

The assumption in Britton's lemma is that the word is equal to this. Any element of a coset H acts as one
 of these for H. In a group, if an element is of this type, it must commute with all other group elements and
 furthermore there is only one of these elements in a group. This is the result of a function composed with its
 inverse. In algebra, there are usually written as e. For matrices, this a matrix with ones down the diagonal
 and zeros elsewhere. For 10 points, name these elements and functions that preserve the operand
 exemplified by how one times any integer b is b.

answer: Gilbert {Ryle}

This philosopher compares a central notion of one work to the claim that a woman either bought a
 left-hand and a right-hand glove, or a pair of gloves, but not both. He claimed that his mission was to
 correct the “logical geography” of a certain type of knowledge in a work whose mission he declares is to
 determine the “logical cross-bearings” of concepts. He criticized a position he claims stems from the
 confusion of Galilean scientific principles as applying to all existing things, the so-called “Official
 Doctrine.” He claimed that the statements “there occur mental processes” and “there occur physical
 processes” are not in the same category. For 10 points, name this author who called Cartesian dualism the
 “ghost in the machine” in his work The Concept of Mind.

answer: simple {harmonic} oscillator [or {SHO}; or simple {harmonic} motion; or {SHM}; or {mass}-{on}-{a}-

One deviation from this ideal system is mathematically described by an equation that includes a term
 proportional to the cube of position, where the proportionality constant is less than zero in the "soft" case.
 That equation is the Duffing equation. Another deviation from this ideal system is mathematically
 described by an equal that includes a term proportional to the time derivative of position, where the
 proportionality constant is known as the damping coefficient. This system itself is described by a
 second-order differential equation formed by equating Newton's Second Law and Hooke's Law. For 10
 points, sinusoidal motion is typical of what kind of system exemplified by pendulums and
 masses-on-springs?

 Cholon and his convoy stopping in front of railroad tracks, where he and his brother were killed. Brothels
 and opium dens were closed under the guidance of his brother's wife, Madame Nhu. Thich Quang Duc

answer: Arnold Schoenberg

In a choral work by this composer, a series of commands shouted by a sergeant are met by a men's
 chorus defiantly singing "Shema Yisroel." His first string quartet is only one movement, takes over forty
 minutes to perform, and consists of asymmetrical phrases this composer called "musical prose." This
 composer founded the Society for Private Musical Performances in order to play modernist music, and

 pieces, such as his Opus 26 Wind Quintet and A Survivor from Warsaw, lack a key center and often feature
 the technique of Sprechtsimme. For 10 points, name this leader of the Second Viennese School who
 developed serialism and the twelve-tone row.

answer: {business cycles} [accept: {business cycle} fluctuations]

One theory to explain these phenomena was offered by the authors of the "Time to Build" paper, and
 invokes the neoclassical growth theory to explain them so that interpretations of these phenomena agree
 with long term growth models. That theory, developed by Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott assumes that
 technology shocks are the cause for them. Wesley Mitchell is best known for his work regarding these
 phenomena, and Austrian theory invokes credit levels as the cause of these phenomena, while William
 Jevons thought that varying sunspot levels are the cause for these. They have variable periodicity, as
 described by Kondratieff waves and Kuznets waves, and in the United States they are tracked by the
 NBER. For 10 points, identify these phenomena which are characterized by booms and busts in economic
 activity.

Elongated shadows are cast by the heads of the figures in this painting upon a long, segmented mirror
 just behind them. A match container and a baton lie on one table in this painting, which is connected to
 another by a folded newspaper. George Moore's response to the female figure in this painting was "What a
 slut." That figure, who wears white headgear, has her hands clasped under the table and her gaze fixed
 downward depressingly, and has been identified as the actress Ellen Andrée. Next to that woman is a man
 who is cut off by the edge of the painting, and between them is a glass of the title substance. For 10 points,
