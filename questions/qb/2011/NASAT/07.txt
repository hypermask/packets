answer: {Bone}

One tumor of this tissue is caused by an EWS to FLI1 translocation and presents with an onion skin
 appearance, and tumors of this tissue often create Codman triangles. Mutations in the src kinase in mice
 results in abnormally high density of this tissue. Besides Ewing’s sarcoma, this tissue is usually destroyed
 heavily in multiple myeloma, creating “punch-out” lesions. The cells that break down this tissue rest in
 Howship’s Lacunae, and Volkmann’s canals run transversely through this tissue, perpendicularly to
 Haversian canals. This tissue contains large amounts of hydroxyapatite, and parathyroid hormone causes its
 resorption. It comes in cortical or compact and cancellous or spongy varieties, and its cells are known as
 osteocytes. This tissue becomes porous in osteoporosis. For 10 points, name this white, hard,
 calcium-containing tissue that composes the skeletal system.

answer: quantum {tunneling}

In bulk metals, this effect explains field electron emission and is described by the Fowler-Nordheim type
 equations. Erasing a NOR flash cell is dependent on this effect occurring in the floating gate, and this effect
 can be used to achieve negative differential resistance in a particular type of diode named for Esaki. This
 phenomenon results in the production of a current in the DC Josephson effect. Alpha decay is governed by
 this process, in which a particle’s Schrodinger equation is represented as a decaying exponential function.
 For 10 points, name this phenomenon of quantum mechanics in which a particle can go through a
 classically forbidden region.

answer: {anti}-{diuretic} hormone [or {ADH}; or {Vasopressin}]

Conivaptan and Tolvaptan are recently approved receptor antagonists of this compound, a derivative of
 which is used to treat uremic platelet dysfuction. Small-cell lung carcinoma often secretes this hormone
 inappropriately, which leads to euvolemic hyponatremia. In pigs, this hormone contains a lysine at the 8th
 position rather than an arginine, and it is under-secreted in central diabetes insipidus. This hormone works
 by inserting additional aquaporins into the membrane of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct.
 This hormone, which like oxytocin is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland, is responsible for staving off
 dehydration. For 10 points, name this hormone which is responsible for signaling the kidneys to retain
