answer: {Slavonic} Dances

In response to these works, Bedrich Smetana composed a group of pieces which include "Oats" and "The
 Little Onion." The fourth and sixth of these works are slow waltzes named for "neighbors," while the fifth
 and seventh are upbeat and are named "jumping." Their composer's Opus 46 and Opus 72, these works
 were originally published for piano four-hands and include two furiants. Commissioned after the success of
 their composer's Moravian Duets, these pieces catapulted their composer to fame after being published by
 Fritz Simrock. Although they were inspired by the folk melodies of Brahms's Hungarian Dances, they
 consist of original melodies set to the rhythms of traditional music from Bohemia. For 10 points, name this
 nationalistic set of dances composed by Antonin Dvorak.

answer: Herbert {Marcuse}

One of this thinker's works discusses the "modifications of realities" which this thinker terms "surplus
 repression," which is distinguished from repression. In that work by this thinker, he critiques another
 thinker's conception of the "guilt feeling" as ever increasing in a section called "The Dialectic of
 Civilization." In another work this thinker critiques capitalism and communism to posit a distinction
 between "true needs" and "repressive needs" before proposing that humanity accept the "great refusal." For
 10 points, identify this Frankfurt school thinker who critiqued Sigmund Freud in his  Eros and Civilization,

answer: {wavefunction}

In the particle-in-a-box model, this quantity is equal to the sum of A sin k x plus B cos k x quantity times
 e to the i omega t, and for the hydrogen atom model this quantity contains the product of a spherical
 harmonic and a Laguerre polynomial. The norm of these quantities is necessarily equal to 1, and the square
 of the magnitude of this quantity at any given state is the probability of the system existing at that state. In
 one interpretation, observation of a system causes the eigenstates of this value to be replaced by a single
 eigenstate. The Hamiltonian operator of this quantity is equal to the total energy of the system times this
 quantity; that equation is named for Schrodinger. For 10 points, name this quantity symbolized psi and used
 to describe the state of a quantum mechanical system.

answer: The Importance of Being {Earnest}

The first act of this play is set in a building on Half-Moon Street, where one character notes that the
 "truth is rarely pure and never simple." In Tom Stoppard's Travesties, the diplomat Henry Carr remembers
 acting in a Zurich production of this play. In it, tension rises when one character produces a cigarette case
 engraved by Cecily. Miss Prism's revelation that she had left a baby in a handbag at Victoria station causes

answer: Battle of Stalingrad

One of the winning sergeants of this battle captured and defended a four-story apartment building now
 called Pavlov's House. The victors of this battle kept their front line as close to the opponents as possible, a
 strategy called “hugging,” which forced most of the fighting onto Mamayev Kurgan Hill. The losers were
 hoping to capture a set of oilfields with a plan dubbed Case Blue. With Operation Uranus, the winners
 encircled General Paulus after the Sixth Army failed to create an “air bridge” with the Luftwaffe. A part of

answer: {proton}

This particle corresponds to the “plus one-half” eigenvalue of the z-component of the isospin, and the
 dominant decay mode of the neutral lambda is into a negative pion and this particle. This particle can be
 found at the intersection of the S equals 0 and Q equals 1 lines of the baryon octet. Stackelberg proposed
 the conservation of baryon number to account for the stability of this particle, whose lifetime is currently
 figured to be at least 10 to the 34th power years. Predicted to decay in some grand unified theories, this
 particle accounts for the majority of the composition of cosmic rays, and can transform into a heavier
 baryon by capturing an electron. Consisting of two up quarks and a down quark, for 10 points, identify this
 subatomic particle, the nucleonic partner of the neutron.

Marcus theory was developed to explain this type of reaction. Henry Taube pioneered using isotope
 tracers to study this type of reaction. One major subtype of these reactions are classified by the inner
 sphere, outer sphere dichotomy. In cells, many of these reactions are catalyzed by flavoproteins. One way
 in which these can occur is hydride transfer. The Nernst equation allows for determining species activities
 in one of these reactions at a given potential. These are either atom or electron transfer reactions. One
 usually balances these by half reactions. For 10 points, name these reactions that see participants change

The structure of these proteins typically consists of a glycine rich N terminal near a lysine along with a
 central aspartic acid needed for the protein’s activity. Long term potentiation in the brain is believed to be
 enhanced in part by members of this group of proteins, one of which is mitogen activated and the other of
 which is regulated by calcium ions and calmodulin. The majority of these proteins act on the amino acids
 tyrosine, threonine, or serine, of which the latter two contain a hydroxyl group. Cyclins work by activating
 one member of this family of proteins. Another member of this family of proteins depends on the level of
 cyclic AMP, while in general this family of proteins works by transferring a certain functional found in
 ATP. For 10 points, name this class of enzymes that transfer a phosphate group.
