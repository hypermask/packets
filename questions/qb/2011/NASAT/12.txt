answer: {flute}

Charles Griffes composed a “poem” for this instrument and orchestra. Messiaen’s “Le Merle Noir” or
 “The Blackbird” was written for piano and this instrument. C.P.E. Bach’s Sonata in A Minor was one of
 the last 18th century solo works for this instrument, which plays a prominent solo in the “Dance of the
 Seven Veils” from Richard Strauss’s opera Salome. Smetana's "Die Moldau" begins with two of these
 instruments playing rapid notes representing streams. Edgard Varese composed Density 21.5 for a platinum
 type of this instrument, whose greatest virtuoso was arguably Jean-Pierre Rampal. Debussy wrote Syrinx
 for this instrument and opened Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun with a solo for it. For 10 points, name

answer: {broken windows} theory

Bernard Harcourt reanalyzed Wesley Skogan’s support of this theory to cast doubt on it in his Illusion of
 Order. Robert Sampson and Stephen Raudenbush used their study of neighborhoods in Chicago to lend
 support to this theory. This theory gained support after one of its proponents, William Bratton, became the
 Police Commissioner of New York. This theory was first developed in a 1982 Atlantic Monthly article

answer: protein {folding}

The kinetics of this process is often studied using laser temperature jump spectroscopy, and it can also be
 studied using dual polarization interferometry. A common technique used to study this process is phi-value
 analysis, and chevron plots are used to depict this process. The timescale of this process is the subject of the
 Levinthal paradox. Anfinsen showed that this process is solely dependent on the sequence of the molecule
 undergoing it in an experiment using ribonuclease, and this process is often assisted by chaperones in the
 cell. When this process goes awry, prions can form, and this process results in the formation of tertiary and
 quaternary structures. For 10 points, name this process by which a protein assumes its three-dimensional
 shape after synthesis.

This thinker contrasted writing, which is controlled by the “metaphysics of presence,” with a form of
 language not derived from speech or writing called “arche-writing.” A lecture by this man showed how the
 example of the incest taboo being natural and cultural demonstrated how “play” could be introduced to a

Takaoka's algorithm reduces the all pairs shortest path problem to this performing this operation. This
 operation on a certain set defines the GL group. One algorithm used to perform this operation is the
 Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm which is faster than the Strassen algorithm. Computing the evolution of a
 finitely described Markov process is done by repeated application of this operation. This operation permits
 zero divisors. This operation is used to perform finite dimension linear maps. This operation is distributive
 and associative, but not commutative. For 10 points, name this operation which involves taking the product

Cytochrome P450 is so named because its complex with this compound has an absorption spectra
 maxima at 450 nanometers. Along with HCL, it is used in a Friedel-Crafts like reaction called the
 Gattermann-Koch reaction. Four molecules of this combine with nickel in an intermediate step of the Mond
 process. Along with hydrogen it is found in syngas and is consumed in the Fischer Tropsch process. When
 this compound binds hemoglobin, it increases hemoglobin's affinity for already bound oxygen, thus
 preventing oxygen from being distributed to the body. For 10 points, name this compound with one carbon

answer: {Humboldt} Current [or {Peru} Current; prompt on "{Eastern Boundary Currents}"]

An animal who shares a name with this place is the jumbo flying squid, Dosidicus gigas, and Elliot's
 storm-petrel is found only in this oceanic system. Andrew Bakun hypothesized that the class this system
 shares with three others would experience an increase in activity due to global warming, and the Guanay
 cormorant feeds mainly on fish found in this system. One important feature of this current is due to trade
 winds causing divergent Ekman transport. When that feature is weakened by El Nino, a regime shift from
 anchovies to sardines occurs in this ecosystem. Southerly trade winds cause this current to upwell
 year-round at its northern extent. For 10 points, name this large marine ecosystem, an eastern boundary
 current lying off the west coast of South American that is the most productive in the world.

One particle composed of three of these entities can decay into a neutral pion and a xi minus baryon.
 This particle is a defining feature of the hyperons. This particle defines a certain quantity which was first
 discovered during a 1947 cosmic collision in which the lifetime was 13 orders of magnitude larger than
 expected, an observation caused by lambda baryons. That property is preserved in strong and
 electromagnetic interactions but not weak interactions. Omega minus baryons have three of these particles,
