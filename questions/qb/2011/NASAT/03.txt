answer: {Lyme} disease

This disease’s vector is responsible for carrying the causative agents of babesiosis and human
 granulocytic anaplasmosis. This disease’s causative agent mutates its VlsE protein to dodge the immune
 system. When this disease reaches the brain, it causes astrogliosis. Its causative agent shares a genus with
 the agent that causes masters disease. A late complication of this disease is an arthritis caused by an
 immune reaction to OspA. Caused by the microaerophile spirochete known as Borrelia burgdorferi, one
 symptom of this disease is a red bullseye rash. This disease, which is carried by Ixodes ticks, is
 characterized by fever and headache. For 10 points, name this disease carried by deer ticks named for a
 Connecticut town.

answer: {Tractatus} Logico-Philosophicus [or Wittgenstein's {Tractatus}]

One section of this work produces a picture of a cube in order to show that seeing two phenomena
 implies "we are really seeing two facts." The author compares this work to a ladder, which the reader must
 "throw away after he has climbed it." This work rejects the notion of "logical constants" that defined the
 writings of Frege and Russell as its "fundamental idea," and defines the world as "everything that is the
 case." It depicts facts in "logico-pictorial form." It begins with seven fundamental propositions, and claims
 that "what we cannot speak of we must pass over in silence." For 10 points, name this work by Ludwig
 Wittgenstein, whose ideas were redacted in Philosophical Investigations.

answer: {Snake} River

Lakes lying along this river include Milner Lake and Lake Walcott near Burley and the Sawtooth
 National Forrest. The travel of trappers along this river was limited by the lava banks in the area
 surrounding the tributary of Henry’s Fork, as well as fear after a massacre near Pierre’s Hole.

 projects like the Ice Harbor Dam located near Pasco where this river ends. This river’s largest tributary is
 the Salmon River, which it meets just after flowing through Hells Canyon. For 10 points, identify this river
 that flows through Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon before becoming the largest tributary to the Columbia

Lincoln Chafee’s great-uncle, Zechariah, denounced these events as a sad irony due to the religion of
 their perpetrator. These events were checked by the actions of Louis Freeland Post and the case Colyer et
 al. v. Skiffington. Some targets of these events, which were led by a man nicknamed the “Fighting Quaker,”

 meiosis. Along with Blumenschein and Kato, this scientist published a landmark evolutionary study on
 their favorite model organism, and this scientist also characterized the suppressor-mutator or SPM element.
 This biologist discovered the nucleolar-organizing region in an early experiment, and in a more famous
 experiment characterized the behavior of the Ac and Ds elements. This biologist noted that changes in
 aleurone color from generation to generation could be explained by genomic mutability, but her work was
 met with much skepticism. For 10 points, name this biologist who used Zea mays to discover transposons.

Ralph Kirkpatrick catalogued the complete works of one composer with this last name. Another
 composer with this last name established the allegro-adagio-allegro form of the Italian overture and was a
 key figure in the development of Neapolitan opera. A composer with this last name traveled to Portugal,
 where he became the music teacher of the future Spanish queen Maria Barbara, who inspired the creation
 of hundreds of single-movement binary works. That composer with this last name became famous after his

Before this view was officially adopted, it was supported by the Spanish monk Guido Terrena.
 Proponents of this religious doctrine point to John 11:49, where God grants the power of prophecy to
 Caiaphus, the judge who condemns Jesus, as proof that God can grant power even to people with moral
 shortcomings. Opponents of this doctrine point to the apparent endorsement of Monothelitism by Honorius
 I. This dogma applies only to statements made ex cathedra about theology. It was first invoked in 1950
 about the Assumption of Mary, but was first articulated in 1870 at the First Vatican Council. For 10 points,
 name this dogma of the Catholic Church, which says that in some circumstances its leader can never be
 wrong.

answer: {mass spectroscopy}

This method is used to look at labelled protein samples in SILAC and ICAT proteomics. Rhenium
 filaments are used in thermal approaches to this. One way of preparing samples for this technique involves
 small volumes of electrically conductive liquid exposed to an electric field. That can result in cones and
 involves charged particles in aerosol. Analyzers used in this technique include time of flight and
 quadrapole ion traps. While preparation with MALDI and electrospray ionization is useful, this technique
 generally involves the Lorentz and centripetal force and the most abundant particle is the base peak. For 10
 points, name this technique that separates ions based on their ratio of charge to its namesake property.

 students were told they were being given a fictional eye-sight improving drug called Superoxin. The
 Cannon-Bard model replaced the earlier James-Lange theory that argued they occur in response to an
 outside stimulus. Jerome Singer and Stanley Schachter created the two-factor theory of them, while Paul
