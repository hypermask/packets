answer: An {Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding}

In this work, one character pretends to be Epicurus defending his religious beliefs. In an earlier section,
 the author of this work declares that mathematical sciences are Relations of Idea, which are distinct from
 Matters of Fact. Largely a reaction to the inductive reasoning of Locke, this work considers cause and
 effect in arguing that we understand complex ideas because of simple ideas, a concept called the Copy
 Principle. It later argues that miracles can’t exist because they contradict the laws of nature, and it earlier
 presents an exception to the Copy Principle by imagining a “missing shade of blue.” For 10 points, name
 this book that draws on A Treatise of Human Nature, also by David Hume.

This artist decorated the house of his longtime patron Sergei Shchukin, who also commissioned a second
 version of an earlier painting in which the central nudes are painted red instead of skin tones. The French
 stockbroker Genevieve Habert noticed that one of his final works, Le Bateau, had been hung upside in the
 MOMA for over a month. In one of this man’s paintings, a woman arranges fruit on a table that blends in
 with the red wall behind it. He painted his wife Amelie Noellie with a stripe dissecting her face in The
 Green Line and with fruit on her head in Woman with a Hat. For 10 points, name this French painter who,
 with Andre Derain, led the Fauvist movement.

The original owners of the pots Othrerir, Bothn, and Son were members of this race named Fjalar and
 Galar, who were killed by Sutungr after killing the god Kvasir. Loki once turned into a fly and bit one of
 these creatures named Eitri, in an attempt to prevent one of these creatures named Brokkr from winning a
 bet. One of these creatures named Alvis attempts to marry the daughter of Thor, but is asked questions until
 the sun rises and turns him into stone. The sons of Ivaldi are members of this race who built the ship of
 Freyr and the spear of Odin. This race may be the same as the svartalfen, or black elves. For 10 points,
 name this race from Norse mythology, notable for being short.

answer: {impedance}

In waveguides, this quantity is proportional to the square root of permeability over permittivity times
 either the wave number or the inverse of the wave number, depending on whether the wave is transverse
 magnetic or transverse electric. In general, this quantity emerges as a constant of proportionality when the
 Poynting theorem is used to calculate the power flow into a given surface. This complex quantity is
 inversely proportional to the frequency for a capacitor and directly proportional to the frequency for an
 inductor. This is the ratio of the complex voltage to the complex current. For 10 points, identify this
 quantity composed of a real resistance and an imaginary reactance, the generalized resistance of alternating
 current flow.

Strongyloidiasis is caused by a member of this phylum, three different members of which are the
 causative agents of lymphatic filariasis. This phylum is divided into the classes Adenophorea and
 Secernentea. Members of this phylum reproduce by using spicules to transfer amoeba-like gamete cells that
 crawl into the genital pore of the female. One organism in this phylum was used by Fire and Mello to
 characterize RNAi; that species’ hermaphrodite contains exactly 959 somatic cells, all of which have been
 fate-mapped. That organism, which was first studied by Sydney Brenner, is C. Elegans. For 10 points,

 act a man enters with a bouquet of snapdragons throwing them as spears at another character he calls
 “houseboy.” This play ends with a woman saying “I am” in response to the wittiest thing said at the party
 that evening. A game called “Get the Guest” reveals one woman had a hysterical pregnancy in its second

This psychologist did an experiment in which participants were asked to sign up for additional trials after
 trying to memorize a list of words and were shocked regardless of performance. He described a process in
 which groups provide an environment where individuals lose self-awareness, which he called
 “deindividuation.” This psychologist worked with Lynne Henderson to create the Shyness Clinic. His most

answer: the {normal} vector [or {N}; or {unit normal} vector]

The flux of a vector field across a surface is given by the double integral, over the surface, of the vector
 field dotted with this quantity. The direction of this vector determines the orientation of a surface. For a
 plane, it can be found by taking the cross product of any two vectors in the plane; for a curve in space, it is
 equal to the derivative of the tangent vector. The direction of this vector, along with any point in the plane,
 defines the plane. For 10 points, name this vector, which is perpendicular to a surface.

answer: neutrinos

The Goesgen experiment used a nuclear reactor to observe their spectra. Experimental setups to study
 these down to the 6.5 megavolt range usually only observe B8 products. Their dynamics show large and
 small mixing angle solutions. Those dynamics are enhanced by the MSW mechanism. One method for
 finding these makes use of large quantities of perchloroethylene such as in the Homestake experiment.
 Research has shown that they can undergo flavor oscillations, and these half-integer spin particles are only
 affected by the weak force. They were first postulated in the form of their antiparticles by Pauli. For 10
 points, name these non-charge-carrying leptons of little mass involved in beta decay.
