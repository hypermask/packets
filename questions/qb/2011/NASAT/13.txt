answer: {Euclidean} Space [prompt on {metric space}]

The Kakutani fixed point theorem applies to functions operating on subsets of this. The standard
 formulation of the Vitali covering lemma has a collection in this as its subject. Transformations in these are
 called rigid motions. One way to generalize length to subsets of this is the Lebesgue measure. Each point in
 a manifold has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to a set in one of these. The linear combinations of
 either the rows or columns of a real valued matrix make a closed, zero containing subset of this. It is a
 metric space whose metric function is the Pythagorean theorem for its dimension and its inner product is
 the dot product. For 10 points, name these spaces symbolized by a blackboard capital R to the n, which are
 named for the Greek author of the Elements.

This city joined Peschiera, Verona, and Legnago in a group of symbiotic Austrian fortresses known as
 the “Quadrilateral.” After the death of Matilda of Canossa, this city was led by the Bonacolsi family. One
 ruler of this city was Francesco II, who cheated on his wife Isabella d’Este with Lucrezia Borgia. Dagobert
 von Wurmser proved unable to defend this city from the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte in a 1796 to 1797
 siege that led to the Treaty of Campo Formio. The Treaty of Cherasco ended a 1628 to 1631 war between
 France and the Holy Roman Emperor over control of this city after the death of its ruling Gonzaga line. For
 10 points, name this Lombard city.

answer: Willard van Orman {Quine}

This thinker argued that children begin by stating “observation sentences,” then move on to “observation
 categoricals.” He argued that many theories could adequately describe the world in his idea of “ontological
 relativity.” In another thought experiment, he argued that one cannot know whether the word “gavagai”
 means “rabbit” or “let’s go hunting.” This man analyzed the sentence “All bachelors are unmarried” to
 reject the analytic/synthetic distinction, and he proposed the Indeterminacy of Translation thesis. For 10

This right was ruled against in the context of fugitive slave laws in the case Ableman v. Booth. A
 campaign of this name was launched by James Hamilton, Jr., but was opposed by William Drayton and
 Robert Hayne. This doctrine was put forth in a report commissioned by William Preston and prompted the
 retaliatory Force Bill. Spelled out in the “South Carolina Exposition and Protest,” it was first called for in
 the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. It was the namesake of a “crisis” following the Tariff of
 Abominations. For 10 points, name this action advocated by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and John
 C. Calhoun that supported the invalidation of an unconstitutional law by a state.

answer: reaction {rate} [accept reaction {rate constant} since many clues are referring to equations to

The equation for the BET isotherm can be derived by adding, for the first and second layers, these values
 of condensation and evaporation. The Lindemann mechanism accurately correlates the changing
 concentration of reactants with this value. Two ratios of constants involved with this value are related by
 the Swain equation, which quantifies the differences of this parameter for hydrogen versus deuterium and
 tritium, illustrating the isotope effect that affects this parameter. The Eyring equation also quantifies this
 parameter, which is related by a power of the concentration of the reactants equal to the order of the
 reaction. The Arrhenius equation also determines, for 10 points, what value, the speed of a reaction?

answer: {John William Strutt}, {Lord Rayleigh} [accept either]

This man showed how interaural level differences and interaural time differences lead to sound
 localization. He first mathematically described the instability of a denser fluid when placed above a less
 dense fluid, an instability co-named for Taylor. The viscosity and thermal diffusivity appear in the
 denominator of his namesake number, which is low when conduction occurs and high when convection
 occurs. For a circular aperture, 1.22 times the wavelength divided by the aperture’s diameter yields this
 man’s criterion, which gives the minimal angular separation required to resolve two separate images.

answer: {torque} [accept {moment} until mentioned]

One of these is given by the gyromagnetic ratio times the angular momentum vector crossed with the
 magnetic field; that form of this phenomenon can cause the precession of the magnetic moment at the
 Larmor frequency. A set of "planetary" gears, beginning with a "sun" gear, comprise a device that acts as a
 "multiplier" of this quantity. When two applied force vectors oppose one another, they form a couple and
 their moment is known as this term. Power is the dot product of angular velocity at this quantity A second
 condition of static equilibrium is that in addition to force, the sum of these terms must be zero. This term is
 computed by taking the cross product of lever arm and force. For 10 points, identify this rotational analog
