answer: titration

In one isothermal version of this technique for protein ligand studies in a calorimeter, a binding
 polynomial is used to analyze the data. Before fluorescence-activated cell sorting, a version of this
 technique using serial dilution is performed using the antibody of interest. This technique produces a curve
 with inflection points for each dissociation equilibrium, which is why polyprotic samples have multiple
 bumps on said curve. Samples are placed in burets for this procedure, and an indicator like phenolphthalein
 is used to determine when the equivalence point has been reached. For 10 points, name this chemical
 procedure which is used to find the concentration of an acid or base in a sample.
