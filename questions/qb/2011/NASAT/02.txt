answer: {Beer}-Lambert-Bouger Law

One application of this law is assessing the purity of a DNA sample after a phenol-chloroform extraction
 by measuring the 260 to 280 ratio, and both the Bradford and Lowry assays make use of this law. Sample
 turbidity and the use of polychromatic radiation make this law inapplicable, and one term in this law is
 expressed in molarity over centimeters and is known as the extinction coefficient. This law states that the
 log of a light’s initial intensity over its measured intensity is equal to the concentration of a species
 multiplied by the distance traveled by the light times its absorptivity, and is commonly used in
 spectrophotometers. For 10 points, name this law of chemistry sometimes named for Lambert and Bouger
 that can be used to find the absorbance or transmittance of a solution.

This element's forbidden spectral lines include 496 and 501 nanometers. Isotope ratios of this element
 distinguish K and R meterorites and identical isotope ratios of it are important evidence for the Giant
 Impact Hypothesis. Studies by the HST have shown that the trace atmosphere of Ganymede is composed of
 compounds of this element. A defining characteristic of carbon stars is that they have more carbon than this
 element. The burning process of this in stars creates silicon. The Bethe-Weizsäcker-cycle uses this element

A distribution function given for these materials is proportional to temperature raised to the three halves
 power and a constant equal to about 4.83 times ten to the twenty first power. Because of diffusion, parts of
 these materials can reach an equilibrium like state called a depletion region. Examples of these materials
 which are pure are called intrinsic and include mercury cadmium telluride. Depending on how they are
 modified, they can be called p or n type and have modified Fermi levels indicating a shift in their band gap.
