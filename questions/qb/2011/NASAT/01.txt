answer: {liquid crystals} [prompt on {nematic material} before {lipid membranes}]

One notable property of these materials can be described by Miezowicz geometries and store
 Frank-Oseen energy. They can suffer from radial hedgehog defects. A change in their orientation by an
 electric field occurs at the Fredericks transistion. The direction of the averaged orientation in these are
 characterized by directors. Lipid membranes in cells are believed to have the dynamics of these. Two
 classes of these are thermotropics and lyotropics. Their phases include columnar, smectic, and nematic.
 These have orientational, but not long range order. For 10 points, name these fluid materials with
 intermediate organizational properties that are used in TV and computer displays.

answer: {glucagon}

A beta-blocker overdose can be treated by using an IV infusion of this hormone. A tumor producing
 this hormone causes necrolytic migrating erythema, and such a tumor can be controlled with octreotide.
 DPP-4 degrades a peptide named for this hormone; that peptide is secreted by L-cells in the intestine. This
 hormone acts through a cAMP-mediated mechanism via a G-protein coupled receptor, and leads to the
 activation of glycogen phosphorylase in the liver and the breakdown of glycogen. This hormone is secreted
 by the alpha cells of the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. For 10 points, name this hormone that
 opposes insulin by raising blood sugar levels.

answer: chromatography

Excluding sample preparation, two of these processes make up the first two phases of MudPit protein
 analysis. This process can be described with an equation that contains terms for eddy-dffusion, longitudinal
 diffusion and mass transfer called the van Deemter equation. A common material used in these setups is
 sepharose. It uses antibodies or other binding molecules in its affinity variant and a charged resin in its ion
 exchange form. The retention time is used to characterize this technique, which typically makes use of a
 column in its gas, liquid or high performance liquid variants. For 10 points, name this chemical technique
 which involves passing a mobile phase through a stationary phase to separate a mixture.

answer: {pyruvate} [or {pyruvic} acid]

Over 90% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have antibodies against an enzyme that breaks
 down this compound. In the Cori cycle, this compound is created in the liver from lactate. One enzyme that
 breaks down this compound contains E1, E2, and E3 subunits and uses lipoic acid and thiamine
 pyrophosphate as cofactors. Transamination of this compound produces alanine. A namesake carboxylase
 converts this compound to oxaloacetate in gluconeogenesis, and a namesake dehydrogenase converts it to
 Acetyl CoA for entrance into the Krebs Cycle. For 10 points, name this three-carbon compound, two

One ridge feature on this body is the Slidr Sulci and a unique class of dark features here are guttae. Its
 largest impact crater is Mazomba. This moon has a unique surface feature called “cantaloupe terrain”,
 which resembles a melon skin. Due to tidal heating, this moon is believed to have spent a billion years in a
 liquid state. This moon’s gravity is believed to cause disruption in the orbit of its neighbor, Nereid. Frozen
 nitrogen is emitted by geysers on this moon, the most notable example of ice volcanoes. Because of its
