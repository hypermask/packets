answer: neuron

An enolase specific to these cells is a tumor marker for small cell lung cancer, and the function of these
 cells is subject to Dale’s principle. Specific types of them include Betz cells and Renshaw cells. The
 Fitzhugh-Nagumo model modifies an earlier mathematical model of their operation, and these cells contain
 a large quantity of ribosome-rich Nissl substance. The first model of their operation was derived by
 Hodgkin and Huxley using patch-clamp experiments. These cells, which are often adjacent to
 oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells, have a hillock between their bodies and a long process that contains
 nodes of Ranvier known as the axon. For 10 points, name these cells which communicate using action

 the safe return of his friend from sea in a poem addressed to Corvinus. He wrote a poem in which a massive
 fish forces the government to set up a council to debate how to properly cook it. Another of his poems is
 largely narrated by Umbricius which compares a rural life favorably to an urban one, while another poem
 warns that even if you lock up your wife, she will simply sleep with the guards as there is no one to guard
 them. This man’s series of sixteen poems in five books coined the phrases “who watches the watchers”

answer: {zinc} [accept {Zn} before mentioned]

The blende of this element is used as a model crystal structure for semiconductors like indium
 phosphide. In one reaction, this element is used with alpha-halo esters to condense ketones or aldehydes to
 form beta-hydroxy-esters. When coupled with copper, this element reacts with alkenes to yield a
 cyclopropane. Those reactions are named for Reformatsky and Simmons-Smith. Found in the ore
 sphalerite, this element and hydrochloric acid reduce ketones to alkanes in the Clemmensen reduction. In
 proteins, this element makes “gag-knuckles,” “treble-clefs,” and other structures known as “fingers.”

answer: fluid {velocity}

In two-dimensional Poseuille flow, the field describing this quantity takes on a parabolic profile. For a
 Newtonian fluid, the shear stress is given by the dynamic viscosity times the gradient in this quantity.
 When the curl of the field representing this quantity is zero, a fluid is called irrotational; that curl is called
 the voriticity. The no-slip condition defines where this quantity is zero, and the product of this quantity
 with the characteristic length and the density, divided by viscosity, yields the Reynolds number. In
 Bernoulli’s equation, the square of this quantity balances the pressure integral. For 10 points, identify this
 quantity which according to Bernoulli’s equation, causes a pressure drop in a fluid when it increases, and
 whose square times the mass gives the kinetic energy of a fluid flow.

answer: {entropy} [prompt on {S}]

For one type of object, this quantity is proportional to the cube of the speed of light and one-fourth the
 area of the object. For an ideal gas, this property approaches negative infinity as temperature approaches
 absolute zero, as a consequence of the natural logarithm term in the Sackur-Tetrode equation. In
 information theory, it is proportional to the sum over all possible values of a random variable of the
 quantity p sub i times natural log of p sub i. That relation is derived from a similar equation, stating it is
 proportional to the natural log of the number of microstates of a system, elucidated by Ludwig Boltzmann.
 For 10 points, name this ever-increasing quantity that measures the amount of disorder in a system.
