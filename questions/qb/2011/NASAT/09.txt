answer: Henry David {Thoreau}

This author wrote “Where’er Thou Sail’st Who Sailed with Me” to commemorate the death of his older
 brother John from lockjaw, though he quipped “My life has been the poem I would have writ” to explain
 his meager poetry output. The narrator of another work is tempted to kill and eat a woodchuck and
 reluctantly drinks some dirty water from the well of John Field in “Baker Farm.” He coined the term
 “Realometer” in another section of that work in which he quotes Cowper to proclaim, “I am monarch of all
 I survey.” This author's best-known work urges you to "simplify, simplify, simplify" and starts with
 sections titled "Economy" and “Where I Lived, and What I Lived For.” For 10 points, identify this
 American author who described his stay in the woods in Walden.

This country’s economy tanked through the eighteen year corrupt rule of Siaka Stevens. In this
 modern-day country, Bai Bureh led a rebellion against British control in response to the Hut Tax. Valentine
 Strasser was responsible for the coup that overthrew this country's president Joseph Momoh. The Abudja
 and Lome agreements attempted to end one conflict in this country, in which British intervention in
 Operation Palliser defeated the RUF, once led by Foday Sankoh. That brutal civil war was notable for the
 RUF’s use of “blood diamonds” to gain funding. For 10 points, name this West African country that has its

answer: {ice} [or {frozen water}]

The Zipper-Rift model is one explanation for the formation of this material during one part of the Earth's
 history. Nye's equation gives the profile of aggregates of it. A tuya is a volcano underneath this. According
 to one hypothesis, the largest amount of this substance present on Earth was during part of the
 Neoproterozoic era. Since this has a high albedo, feedback loops involving this and reflected light are
 important in climate models. Information about past climates can be gleaned from trapped gases and pollen
 in cores of this. The last greatest extent of this material was about 20,000 years ago. For 10 points, name
 this material that makes up glaciers.

Legitimation Crisis. This author also wrote about the growth of a "literary" version of the title concept out
 of the "bourgeois" version in a work that discusses the emergence of the modern social welfare state. This
 man also challenged Max Weber's definition of rationalization in a work that defines aesthetic, therapeutic,

answer: Giacomo {Meyerbeer} [or Jakob Liebmann {Meyer Beer}]

This composer expanded his early singspiel about the romantic exploits of Peter the Great into an opera
 about Frederick the Great's flute-playing career, The North Star. This composer’s time at the Prussian court
 proved crucial to the career of Richard Wagner, as he pushed for the first performances of Rienzi and The
 Flying Dutchman. Ghosts of nuns rise from coffins and dance a ballet in another of his operas, which ends
 with Bertram failing to claim his title son's soul. In addition to that first “grand opera,” he also wrote about
 Valentine and Raoul’s love in an opera that ends with the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre. For 10 points,

answer: {Mount Kenya}

This mountain’s unusual shape comes from the fact that it is a lava plug eroded by glaciers. Local tribes
 build their houses so that this mountain is visible from the door, because the god Ngai is said to live here.
 In 1888, the Hungarian explorer Count Teleki became the first European to attempt to climb this mountain,
 and also discovered nearby Lake Rudolf, now called Lake Turkana. This extinct stratovolcano dates to the
 opening of the nearby Great Rift Valley. The culture of the nearby Kikuyu tribe was described in a famous
 anthropology book about "facing" this mountain. For 10 points, name this second highest mountain in

answer: Friedrich August von {Hayek}

This economist was also interested in neurology, and published a brain science book titled The Sensory
 Order. This economist’s early work focused on how information was conveyed to consumers by the cost of
 goods, the price signaling mechanism, which this economist argued created a “spontaneous order.” Late in
 his career, this economist argued that banks should be able to issue their own money, which he said would
 create a competition to create the best currency. This man’s political views can be found in the book The

The FACT complex assists in one phase of this process, and one protein that initiates this process is
 mutated in Spinocerebellar Ataxia 17, in which its poly-Q tract is expanded. This process is inhibited by
 actinomycin D. In bacteria, the rho factor can terminate this process, and sigma factors help initiate it.

answer: {bipolar junction} transistor [or {BJT}; prompt on {"transistor"}]

One model of these devices is known as the most exquisite model. An older method for making these is the double diffused epitaxial process. For one of these devices, the transport factor over one minus the transport factor is equal to the gain. Their modes of operation are cutoff, forward active, reverse active, and saturation. They are the subject of the Gummel-Poon and the Ebbers-Moll models. The increase of a particular voltage in one causes an increase in current known as the Early effect. They can be of either pnp or npn form, and they consist of a collector, base, and emitter. For 10 points, name this type of transistor that contrast with field effect transistors.

A general from this city named Pagondas led the victorious forces over Athens at the battle of Delium.
 This city allied with Sparta during the Peloponnesian War, partly because of the support Athens gave its
 regional rival Plataea. It later turned on Sparta, killing Lysander at the Battle of Haliartus. This city’s
 victory over Sparta at Mantinea proved costly, as it lost Epaminondas, who had raised this city to new
 heights by winning at Leuctra and leading the Sacred Band. For 10 points, name this Boeotian city which

answer: cosmic {inflation}

The existence of an “Axis of Evil” in the CMB may indicate that this process occurred in a certain
 direction, though the occurrence of this process would imply that the universe is isotropic. The occurrence
 of this process implies that the gravitational collapse of quantum fluctuations lead to the formation of
 large-scale structures, and the gravitational radiation produced by this process is encoded in the B-modes of
 the CMB. The original formulation of this process had a metastable supercooled state terminated by a
 process of bubble nucleation via quantum tunneling, though that model suffered from the graceful exit
 problem. Linde proposed a slow-roll version of this process, and it was originally postulated to solve the
 flatness, horizon, and monopole problems. Originally proposed by Alan Guth, for 10 points, name this
 process of rapid exponential expansion in the early universe, immediately after the big bang.
