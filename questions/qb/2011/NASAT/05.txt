answer: {regular}

For Sturm-Liouville problems to be of this type, the two boundary conditions must be linearly
 independent. This word also describes points at which all coefficient functions in a standard form
 differential equation are analytic. In both of those definitions, this word contrasts with singular, as it also
 does to describe matrices that have inverses. All vertices have the same degree in this sort of graph. This
 word also describes expressions that, like grammars, can define the languages of finite automata; those
 expressions are often used in string matching. For 10 points, identify this word that also applies to polygons
 in which the side lengths and angle measures are all equal.

answer: Vandals

The last ruler of one branch of these people fled battle after watching his brother Tzazo cut down at
 Tricamarum. Tribes of these people included the Hasdingi and the Silingi. Belisarius’s first great campaign
 was against a kingdom of these people led by Gelimer. These believers in Arianism persecuted other
 Christians after sacking Carthage and making it the capital of their North African kingdom. A letter sent by
 Licinia Eudoxia requesting assistance from their leader Gaiseric led to the 455 sack of Rome. For 10 points,
 identify this Germanic tribe whose name has become synonymous with destruction of property.

answer: motets

One piece of this type is only forty six bars long and was written for Anton Stoll while its composer was
 working on The Magic Flute. The musical analogue of anthems written by English composers, these pieces
 include Mozart's Ave verum corpus, as well as a piece celebrating a gift of a golden rose for the high altar
 of Santa Maria del Fiore. That last great isorhythmic one is called Nuper rosarum flores. The "grande" and
 "petit" varieties of these pieces were mastered by Jean-Baptiste Lully, who included soloists in them. First
 composed by the Notre Dame school and later by Guillames de Machaut and Dufay, they typically
 consisted of a discant sung over a cantus firmus. For 10 points, name this typically polyphonic setting of a
 sacred text, one of the most popular forms of medieval music along with madrigals.

In a novel by this author, Ephraim Jekinson scams Moses out of his money and cheats the protagonist out
 of a horse. That novel ends with George’s marriage to Arabella Wilmot and the revelation that Sophia is
 actually married to Mr. Burchell’s alter ego, Squire Thornhill. In one of this author’s plays, two men at the
 Three Pigeons pub are tricked into staying at a mansion that they believe is an inn, causing them to treat the
 owners like servants. In that play, Hastings and his lover Constance steal some jewels with Tony Lumpkin,
 and Charles Marlow is wooed by a woman disguised as a barmaid. For 10 points, name this author who
 created Dr. Primrose and Kate Hardcastle in The Vicar of Wakefield and She Stoops to Conquer.

Chimera d’Arezzo. He created a marble crucifix for his own tomb but now resides in the Escorial. His
 portrait work includes a bust of Bindo Altoviti and one of Cosimo I. An antlered stag sticks out above a

answer: {traveling salesman} problem

Arora's PTAS uses quadtrees to attack a restrict case of this issue, which is the target of the Christofides
 algorithm. A historical bound on it is given by the Held-Karp algorithm. If the triangle inequality holds,
 then the restricted case is known as metric; further constraints yield the Euclidean version of this problem.
 One solution to this problem is the "nearest neighbor" algorithm, though that solution is only optimal in
 certain cases. An early description of this problem included hypothetical routes through towns in Germany
 and Switzerland. For 10 points, name this optimization problem in computer science in which a merchant
 must determine the shortest path that will take him to each city in a route exactly once.

Cities lying on this body of water include Bol and N’guigmi. When its water levels are high, its water is
 diverted through a string of basins called the Soro, and its water is also discharged into the Bodélé
 Depression. It is partially fed by the Yobe River, but primarily by the Chari River, and it separated into

answer: {bilirubin} [or {conjugated} , unconjugated, direct or indirect {bilirubin} ]

One disorder that causes increased levels of this compound results from a mutation in the cMOAT gene,
 while another is caused by mutations leading to decreased UGT1. Besides Dubin-Johnson, Gilbert, and
 Rotor’s syndrome, inactivating mutations in UDP glucoronosyltransferase lead to accumulation of the
 unconjugated form of this substance in Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Lab tests usually measure both the direct
 and indirect versions of this open-chain polypyrrole. Exposing this substance to light transforms it from the
 ZZ to EE isomer, which is why ultraviolet light is a treatment for the accumulation of this substance in
 newborns. For 10 points, name this product of heme metabolism, which when elevated causes jaundice.

 throwing away the key because they are frightened by mysterious noises. This author of "The Continuity of
 Parks" and "House Taken Over" wrote a story in which the narrator switches places with an animal in the
 Jardin des Plantes. This author of "Axolotl" also wrote a story whose name literally translates as "The

Supporters of two different men of this name fought at the Battle of Sauchieburn, where the Homes and
 Hepburns killed the third holder of this name and elevated the fourth. An earlier holder of this name was
 assassinated by Walter, the Earl of Atholl, and wrote the Kingis Quair. The fourth holder of this name
 allied with France and was thus killed by Thomas Howard, the earl of Surrey, in 1513 after fighting English
 longbills at Flodden Field. The sixth king of this name, through his descent from the fourth’s marriage to
 Margaret Tudor, added a new kingdom to his realms. For 10 points, identify this common name for kings

answer: {liquidity trap}

Svensson proposed a "foolproof" way of dealing with this issue, which is also addressed by Gesell's
 carry tax. Pigou argued that a low wage rate and the real balance effect could counteract this situation. This
 situation is represented as an intersection of the IS curve with a flat LM curve. Money and bonds are
 essentially substitutes when this situation occurs. Traditionally defined as a situation in which the demand
 for money is infinitely elastic, it occurred in Japan in the 1990s when interest rates dropped almost to zero.
 For 10 points, name these situations where monetary policies do little to change demand and growth.

 Henrietta Maria, along with a triple portrait of her husband in which the two outer personages stare at the

 Review of the Declaration." He outlined seven criteria, including intensity, duration, and certainty, for the
 desirability of a given action. He rejected the idea of natural rights, since rights themselves can only be
 granted by the law. This man attacked another author's "antipathy to reform" of the laws in a critique of

For a solid-liquid suspension, Ralph Bagnold defined a "dynamic" version of this force and
 characterized its "effective angle" as the arctangent of the ratio of the normal and shear stresses. The
 Bilman-Sorine Model modifies the Dahl Model to account for this force's decrease with increasing velocity
 in the low-velocity regime, an effect discovered by Richard Stribeck. Counterintuitively, it is independent
 of cross-sectional area by Amontons' Second Law. Amontons' First Law, rediscovered by Charles

One of these enzymes associates with a donut-shaped dimer known as the sliding clamp, made up of
 two beta subunits of its holoenzyme. Another of these enzymes, when cleaved by subtilisin, produces a
 C-terminal fragment known as the Klenow fragment. Arthur Kornberg discovered the first of these
 enzymes used in Sanger sequencing. The synthesis of two "bypass" ones is induced by the SOS response,
 and one of those forms a namesake mutasome that incorrectly adds guanine opposite a thymine residue
 about half as often as it correctly adds adenine. For 10 points, name this family of enzymes that aids in
