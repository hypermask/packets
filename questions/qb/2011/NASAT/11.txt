answer: {p} orbitals

Bent’s rule states that atomic orbitals directed towards electronegative groups have this character, and
 part of the derivation of the Lamb shift relies on the fact that the nonrelativistic wave function for these
 entities vanishes at the origin. In crystal field theory, a group of them is labeled t sub 1u. These entities
 generally have n minus 2 radial nodes, and the magnetic quantum numbers of these entities vary from
 negative 1 to 1. They overlap perpendicularly to form pi bonds. They are shaped like dumbbells and are
 mutually perpendicular to each other, intersecting at the origin. They hold 6 electrons. For 10 points, name
 this electronic orbitals that are larger than s and smaller than d orbitals.

This thinker wrote a work about the tension between “managerialism” and “socialism” and in another
 book discusses the idea of “countervailing power,” arguing organized labor and the federal government
 will replace free market competition as the primary check on corporate power. This economist asserted that
 large companies have made perfect competition impossible because the rules of supply and demand have
 been undermined by the use of advertising in his book  The New Industrial State. His best-known work
 outlines the “dependence effect” and discusses the emergence of the private sector in America after World

answer: {Ascomycota} [or Sac Fungi before mentioned]

The causative agent of Dutch elm disease belongs in this phylum, as does the causative agents of
 sporotrichosis, blastomycosis, and histoplasmosis. One organism in this phylum infects ants’ brains and
 grows out of their heads; that species is named Chordyceps. Candida albicans, a member of this phylum,
 causes yeast infections, and these organisms reproduceby plasmogamy followed by delayed fusion of the
 paired nuclei, though some reproduce asexually. This phylum gets its name from the fruiting bodies
 containing its spores. Like others in their kingdom, their bodies contain hyphae which form a mycelium,
 and familiar members include brewer’s yeast and baker’s yeast. For 10 points, name this phylum of fungi,
 sometimes called sac fungi.

 Dies Irae in its seventh and eleventh variations, and inverts the main theme from A minor to D flat major in
 its andante cantabile 18th variation. Composed in 1934, it is based on another composer's twenty-fourth
 violin caprice. For 10 points, name this orchestral work by Sergei Rachmaninoff titled for a legendary

The Producer-Consumer problem arises when multiple threads try to access one of these of bounded or
 unbounded size. Two or three pointers are usually used when using an array to create a ring or circular one
 of these. Depth information for a 3D scene can be stored in a z one. In many computer graphics paradigms
 like OpenGl, the final store of the generated image is known as the frame one. TCP has the receiver

answer: {conductivity} [accept {thermal conductivity} or {electrical conductivity}; prompt on {kappa};

The ratio of two types of this property equals the product of the Lorenz number and temperature by the
 Wiedemann-Franz Law. The first of those types is, for phonons, equal to one-third times the specific heat
 per unit volume times the velocity times the average mean free path; it is also the coefficient of
 proportionality in Fourier's Law. At a fixed temperature, the second of those types is equal to the length
 divided by the product of the cross-sectional area and resistance, or alternatively, one over the resistivity.
 For 10 points, thermal and electrical are two types of what property of a material, the degree to which it

answer: {critical} point [or {critical} temperature]

State functions like pressure, volume, and temperature are often normalized to a “reduced” form based
 on their values at this point, which can calculated using the Joback and Lydersen methods. Below this
 point, the Van der Waals equation gives a region where pressure increases as volume increases; that
 problem is fixed with the Maxwell isotherm. According to the Guldberg rule, a liquid’s boiling point is
 about two thirds its temperature at this point. Above this point, carbon dioxide is often used as a green
 alternative method to remove caffeine from coffee. This point is also characterized by a nearly vertical line
