answer: {angular momentum} [prompt on "{L}"; do not accept "{momentum}"]

This quantity’s interactions are described by the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme. In quantum mechanics, its expansion in uncoupled bases requires Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. One result about this quantity follows from the directional symmetry of space, according to Noether's theorem. A consequence of that result is the fact that a line drawn from a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. Defined as the cross product of the position vector and its linear analogue, this quantity is conserved in the absence of an external torque. For 10 points, name this rotational quantity, the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity.
