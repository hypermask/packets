answer: {Nuclear Magnetic Resonance} spectroscopy

One form of this technique is followed by sequential walking and uses the Nuclear Overhauser effect. A two-dimensional type of this technique is called COSY. This procedure produces data expressed in parts per billion and is affected by J-coupling. Often using tetramethylsilane as a reference compound, one type of this technique is enhanced by cross-polarization while another type requires deuterated solvents. It comes in proton and carbon-13 varieties and produces a graph with absorption peaks created by chemical shifts. For 10 points, name this spectroscopic method for determining chemical structures by applying a magnetic pulse.

answer: {auxins} [prompt on {plant hormones} before mention]

These substances are transported by PIN proteins and bind to TIR1. They stimulate proton pumps to lower the pH and activate expansins, according to the acid growth hypothesis. In high concentrations, they stimulate excess ethylene production, which induces abscission, hence the use of these compounds in herbicides like Agent Orange. Indole-3-acetic acid is one example of these compounds which contribute to apical dominance, phototropisms, and cell elongation. For 10 points, name these plant hormones whose effect is strengthened in the presence of cytokinins and gibberellins.
