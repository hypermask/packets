answer: {entropy}

The von Neumann form of this concept is given in terms of the trace of a density matrix times its log. The Sackur-Tetrode equation gives this quantity extensively, avoiding the Gibbs paradox. Defined as the Boltzmann constant times natural log of the number of microstates, it is multiplied by temperature in the expression for Gibbs free energy. Maxwell's hypothetical demon purports to lowers this quantity. Symbolized by the letter S, its tendency to increase is dictated by the second law of thermodynamics.

answer: matrix {determinant}

This is the only alternating multilinear function, up to a constant factor. This function can be expressed in terms of the sign function of elements in the symmetric group, as in the Leibniz formula. Using the Laplace expansion, it can be computed via expansion by minors. This function appears in the formula for a characteristic polynomial, as well as in Cramer's rule. It equals 0 if and only if the matrix is non-invertible, and it equals 1 for an identity matrix. For 10 points, name this value associated with a square matrix, which for a 2 by 2 matrix is calculated as ad minus bc.

answer: cell {membrane} or {plasma membrane}

The phosphatidylserine (“foss-fuh-tie-dil-ser-een”) in this structure is redistributed by scramblases and flippases, which facilitate the transverse diffusion of its components. SNARE complexes and clathrin coats facilitate one of its functions. During apoptosis, localized decoupling of this structure leads to blebbing. Components of this structure include G protein-coupled receptors, aquaporins, sodium-potassium pumps, and ion channels. Described by the fluid mosaic model, this structure consists of a phospholipid bilayer. In plants, this semipermeable structure is found just inside the cell wall. For 10 points, name this organelle marking the boundary of a cell.
