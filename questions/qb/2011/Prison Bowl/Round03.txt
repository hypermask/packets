answer: {diffusion} [do not accept "{effusion}"]

The denominator of the Thiele modulus is the rate of this process, whose anisotropic type is used to reduce image noise. Explained by the Ehrenfest model, this process is used to enrich uranium and dope semiconductors. Its rate is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass, and proportional to the gradient of the concentration field. Governed by Fick's laws and Graham's law, it causes water to move through semi-permeable membranes in osmosis. For 10 points, name this process by which particles move from regions of high concentration to those of low concentration.
