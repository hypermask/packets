answer: {addition} or {summation}

In category theory, this concept is generalized by the coproduct, and its analogue in set theory is the disjoint union.

Georg Bossong discovered that these grammatical elements are marked differently in DOM languages. In ergative languages, they are marked by the absolutive case. In Latin, the ablative case is sometimes used for these sentence elements though they are more commonly marked by the dative and accusative cases. In languages like Korean and Japanese this sentence element occurs before the verb, but in English it occurs after the verb. They are not used with intransitive verbs and can be classified as prepositional, indirect, or direct. For 10 points, name this grammatical element that receives the action of the verb, often paired with a subject.

answer: {Newton's Second} Law of Motion [prompt on {F} = {ma}]

One analogue of this law relates the expectation value of an operator to its commutator with the Hamiltonian; that analogue, Ehrenfest's theorem, reduces to this equation in the limit of large quantum numbers. A term accounting for the loss of exhaust is added to one side of this equation to obtain the ideal rocket equation. The impulse-momentum theorem follows from this law, whose rotational analogue states that torque equals moment of inertia times alpha. Its original form stated that net force equals the time derivative of momentum. For 10 points, name this law of physics which states that force equals mass times acceleration.
