answer: {Saladin} or {Salahuddin} or {Salah}-{ad}-{Din} Yusuf ibn Ayyub

At Masyaf, this ruler surrounded his tent with chalk to reveal the footsteps of the Assassins. He was a Kurd from Tikrit, and a rival of the Fatimid ruler Nur-ad-Din. Although he failed in his siege of Kerak, his forces were able to retreat due to the hesitation of enemy reinforcements. He personally executed Raynald de Chatillon but spared Guy de Lusignan. After his conquest of a certain city, he accepted ransoms for all of its Frankish inhabitants and allowed Christian pilgrimage. For 10 points, name this founder of the Ayyubid dynasty and chivalrous conqueror of Jerusalem.

answer: Isaac {Bruce}

This player’s first career reception came on a touchdown pass from quarterback Chris Miller against the Atlanta Falcons. He currently has the third most career receiving yards in NFL history and in 2010, he signed a one-day contract with the St. Louis Rams so that he could retire with the team he now holds every major receiving record for. He won his only Super Bowl in Super Bowl 34, in which he caught the game-winning touchdown. For 10 points, name this wide receiver, who along with Kurt Warner and Marshall Faulk, formed the “Greatest Show on Turf.”

answer: {noble} gases [accept {group 18} before it is mentioned]

The discovery of several of these through fractional distillation earned William Ramsay the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Commonly used in Geiger counters, they are used in a shorthand notation for electron configurations. Linus Pauling predicted that the heavier ones could form fluoride compounds. These elements have the highest first ionization energies of any group, and are characterized by a full valence shell. Comprising group 18, they are found on the far right of the periodic table and include xenon, argon, krypton, and neon. For 10 points, name this group of gases named for their inertness.

answer: {meiosis} [do not accept “mitosis”]

The synaptonemal complex forms during this process, which does not occur in bdelloids. It features the pachytene and leptotene stages and produces polar bodies in females. During this process, tetrads form and establish chiasmata, allowing genes to cross over. Genetic disorders can result from nondisjunction in this process, which begins with prophase I. In this process accompanying oogenesis and spermatogenesis, diploid cells divide into four haploid gamete cells. For 10 points, name this process necessary for sexual reproduction.

answer: Madame Bovary

In this novel, one character sends a breakup letter with a basket of apricots, and another looks up to Lucy Ashton after attending a performance of Lucia di Lammermoor. The club-footed Hippolyte has his leg amputated after the title character's husband botches a surgery. The moneylender Lhereux brings about the financial ruin of the title character, who has an affair with the wealthy Rodolphe Boulanger. In this novel, Charles and his wife move to Yonville where Leon Dupuis has an affair with the title character Emma. For 10 points, name this novel by Gustave Flaubert.

answer: {black holes}

Charged examples of these objects exhibit an internal boundary named for Cauchy and satisfy the Reissner-Nordstrom metric. A photon sphere can occur near one of these, and the Penrose process seeks to extract energy from their ergospheres. The Lense-Thirring effect describes the frame-dragging produced by a rotating one of these objects subject to the no-hair theorem. Spontaneous pair production results in their emission of Hawking radiation, and the Schwarzchild radius is the distance from the center at which the event horizon occurs. Found at the center of galaxies, for 10 points, name these gravitational singularities from which nothing can escape.
