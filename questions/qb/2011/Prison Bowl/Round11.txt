answer: {refraction} [accept word forms]

Veselago studied one form of this phenomenon which occurs when the dot product of the Poynting vector and the wavevector is negative. Its negative form is exhibited by left-handed metamaterials, and another form occurs in anisotropic materials, where it produces extraordinary and ordinary rays, such as in calcite. The angle at which this occurs appears in Snell's law along with this phenomenon's namesake dimensionless index. Occurring due to a change in a wave's speed, it makes straws appear bent in water. For 10 points, name this phenomenon that causes a light wave to change direction.

This man discovered that a geometric increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels leads to an arithmetic increase in temperature. The Eyring equation is equivalent to his namesake equation, which includes a constant equal to the steric factor times the collision rate, called the pre-exponential factor. That equation states that “k equals A times e to the negative E sub a over RT,” which relates the rate of a reaction to its activation energy. His definition of acids and bases as H+ and OH- donors was superseded by the Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis definitions. For 10 points, name this Swedish chemist.
