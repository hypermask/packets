answer: {complex} numbers [prompt on {C}; do not accept "{imaginary numbers}"]

The Cayley-Dickson construction extends the set of these entities to the quaternions and octonions, and the Gaussian integers are a subset of them. Their algebraic closure is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of algebra. Uniquely determined by their absolute value and argument, they can be plotted on an Argand diagram. When expressed in polar form as "r cis theta," they can be multiplied using de Moivre's identity. Each of these numbers has a conjugate, found by reversing the sign of its imaginary part. For 10 points, name these numbers of the form a+bi.

Positional types of these effects result from competition between actors that leads to inefficiency, such as conspicuous consumption. They can be offset by bargaining and well-defined property rights instead of by government regulation, according to the Coase theorem.

answer: {electrons} <LC>

The Auger effect results in the emission of one of these entities, whose magnetic dipole moment is the Bohr magneton. An exciton is composed of a hole and one of these particles, whose deceleration causes Bremsstrahlung. Captured into the nucleus in one form of radioactive decay, they are emitted along with protons and antineutrinos in beta-minus decay. Their charge was measured by Millikan in the oil drop experiment, and their antiparticle is the positron. For 10 points, name these negatively charged elementary particles.
