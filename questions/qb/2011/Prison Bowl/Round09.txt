answer: {Polymerase Chain Reaction}

The methylation-specific form of this procedure is used on CpG islands. Its touchdown variant utilizes a gradual lowering of the temperature, and cDNA is generated from RNA in the RT version of this procedure. Typically requiring dNTPs, magnesium ions, and primers, it takes advantage of the ability of its namesake Thermus aquaticus enzyme to withstand high temperatures. Taking place through denaturation, annealing, and elongation steps, this procedure typically takes 20 to 40 thermal cycles, each of which doubles the amount of DNA present. For 10 points, name this lab technique used to amplify short pieces of DNA.
