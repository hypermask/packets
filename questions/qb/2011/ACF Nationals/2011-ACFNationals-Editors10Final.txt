answer: {singularity} or {singularities}

For the congruence class of time-like geodesics, one of these can be shown to occur in the expansion by combining the strong energy condition and Rayachaudhuri’s equation to show that the derivative of one over the expansion with respect to proper time is greater or equal to one-third. Gannon’s theorem shows that one of these must develop when the strong energy and timelike and null conditions are satisfied and no closed timelike curve exists. That theorem is itself a generalization of a theorem by Hawking and Penrose in which these phenomena arise in geodesically incomplete manifolds, and one of these must always be shielded by an event horizon if the cosmic censorship conjecture holds. One of these can be obtained by running the FRW solutions backwards in time, while another one occurs at r equals zero in the Schwarzschild solution to the Einstein field equations. For ten points, identify these regions of space in which the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite.

answer: {Darwin Among} the {Machines}

At one point, this work posits that if all animals in Britain were to die and foreign trade ceased, the “loss of life would be something fearful to contemplate,” in order to draw analogy. In reference to perpetuation of the title beings, this work suggests that “the days of flirtation, courtship, and matrimony appear to be very remote,” but nevertheless cautions the addressees against “becoming more subservient.” This work suggests that if we compare the lever to the Great Eastern, we will be “awestruck at the vast development,” and asks in reference to that development, “In what direction is it tending? What will be its upshot?” First published in the form of a letter from “Cellarius” to the Christchurch Press, this essay conjectures that “an entirely new kingdom has sprung up,” and that “mechanical life,” is parasitic upon human life and thus should be destroyed. With its ideas forming the core of its author’s later novel Erewhon, for ten points, identify this essay inspired by the author’s reading of On The Origin of Species, which suggests that technology coevolves with people and which was written by Samuel Butler.

answer: {compatibilism} [prompt on “ {free will} ”]

Derek Pereboom has developed a so-called “Four-Case” argument against this philosophical position. Peter Strawson argued for this philosophical doctrine on the basis of resentment by analyzing the psychological impossibility of abandoning reactive attitudes. John Martin Fischer advocates a “semi-” version of this philosophical position by denying the “principle of transfer of blamelessness” in fail-safe situations, while Harry Frankfurt argued for this philosophical position in a 1969 paper by denying the Principle of Alternative possibilities. Daniel Dennet argued for this position by positing the possibility of constructing a deterministic deliberator in his book Elbow Room, and in general arguments for this position affirm the possibility of assigning moral responsibility despite the fact that every event is causally determined by previous events. For ten points, identify this philosophical view which holds that there is no contradiction between determinism and free will.

answer: the {Norse temple} at {Uppsala} or {Gamla Uppsala} or {Old Upssala}

One report of this location claims that it was the site of a feast that occurred every nine years, and one of the beings worshipped at this location was known as “the Furious.” This location may also have been the site of an autumn sacrifice called the disablot, which was intended to honor female deities called disir. The remains of this location include three massive burial mounds believed to be the resting places of three kings of the Svear, and most contemporary knowledge of this place comes from the Gesta Hammaburgensis, which also claimed that this place was surrounded with a golden chain and was home to three gold-covered statues of gods. According to Adam of Bremen, the grove near this location would sometimes house the hanged bodies of up to 72 men, horses, and dogs, and this location was also reportedly home to a giant evergreen tree, which represented Yggdrasill. For ten points, identify this location in Sweden, which was the site of worship of such deities as Frey, Thor, and Odin.

answer: Sergei {Prokofiev}

Boris Berman wrote a guide to playing this composer's piano sonatas, and was the first pianist to record this composer's complete piano music. His second piano concerto was attacked as a "Babel of insane sounds" after its premiere, and includes a massive first movement cadenza whose climax is marked colossale. This composer categorized all of his music into five major lines: classical, modern, motoric, lyrical, and grotesque. His "motoric" music includes his opus 11 toccata, which begins with the right and left hands alternatively playing repeated D's, and the third movement of his sixth piano sonata, which is grouped with his seventh and eighth piano sonatas as his "war sonatas." He composed the "Dance of the Knights" for his ballet Romeo and Juliet. For 10 points, name this Soviet composer of the Lieutenant Kije suite and The Love for Three Oranges.

answer: {Letters} From an {American Farmer}

In the second of these works, the narrator kills a kingbird and extracts bees from its mouth, allowing the ones that remained alive to return to their hive. The eleventh is written in the persona of a "Russian gentleman," and describes a visit to the naturalist John Bartram. The ninth of them portrays the narrator's horror at a slave left in a cage to die, and criticizes the effects of slavery on Charleston, South Carolina, which contrasts with the narrator's praise for the industriousness of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in the fourth through eighth of them. The third one claims that in the United States, "individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men," and is titled "What is an American?" They are framed as correspondences between the English minister Mr. F. B. and the title character, "James," who describes his cultivation of Pine Hill. For 10 points, name these twelve epistolary works by Hector St. John Crevecoeur.

On the right edge of this painting, a red shawl provides a burst of color. On the left, an orange can be seen on the only empty chair in the painting, which is located in between two figures wearing black hats. Painted during its artist’s trip to copy Velazquezes in the Prado, this eleven foot wide work is currently on display at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. A man in the center of this painting throws back his head with his mouth open, rapping out the syllables of the cante jondo. In its background, two guitars hang from hooks and “Ole” is scribbled on the wall above a group of women who clap and snap along to the action. In the foreground, the central figure leans back, her right hand holding up the silver mass of her skirt as the left hand stabs out into the air. For 10 points, name this painting of a flamenco dancer by John Singer Sargent.

answer: {German unification} [accept anything the {implies} the {creation} of a {single German nation}-{state}; do not accept “{German re}-{unification},” as that {refers} to the {events} of {1989}-{1990}]

Among those who agitated for this goal was founder Ferdinand Lasalle, who advocated for it in his pamphlet, “Democratic Studies.” One notable proponent of this goal advocated its “small” version and outlined the mechanisms by which it could be achieved in his Putbus Memorandum, while liberals such as Johannes Miquel, a leader of the National Liberal Party, typically advocated its “large” version. This goal was the one of the foundational points of the platform of the Progress Party, which also argued for the maintenance of the militia in case “these blessings have to be preserved or attained by war.” This goal was achieved shortly before the signing of the Treaty of Frankfurt when Baden and Hesse requested admission to a northern confederation and money from the “Guelph fund” was used to bribe King Ludwig of Bavaria to offer a crown on behalf of the princes. For ten points, identify this goal of, among others, Otto Bismarck, which came to fruition at Versailles with the crowning of Wilhelm I of Prussia as Kaiser of a new nation.

answer: {geomagnetic storms}

An advance warning of one of these events can be provided if the shock at the L1 Lagrange point can be detected. These phenomena induce variations in a quantity known as TEC, the “total electron content,” and the energy transferred during one of these events is measured with the Dst index. The severity of these events is typically measured using the Ap index, with an Ap index of over 100 signifying a major one of these events. These events typically occur in three phases, beginning with a “sudden commencement,” corresponding to a field intensification at ground level, followed by “initial,” and “main,” phases during the latter of which a ring current induces a drop in field intensity. These events occur shortly following such events as a solar flare or a coronal mass ejection and result in the compression of the magnetosphere by the associated plasma flow. For ten points, identify these fluctuations in the Earth’s magnetic field caused by disturbances arriving via solar wind.

answer: {tumor necrosis} factor {alpha} (accept “ {cachexin} ” or “ {cachectin} ” early; do not prompt on or accept {tumor necrosis factor beta} or {TNF-beta} ; don’t accept TGF , which is something else altogether )

The dynamics of this molecule’s receptors are described by the ligand-passing model, and it is cleaved by the metallopeptidase ADAM17. This molecule induces externalization of granules and surface expression of P-selectin in Weibel-Palade bodies. It was discovered as a suppressor of lipoprotein lipase and as a factor involved in triglyceridemia, leading to its alternative name of cachexin. Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against this protein, was developed by Mark Feldmann and colleagues, who studied the signalling cascade of this protein in rheumatoid arthritis. Like FAS, this molecule’s receptor associates with TRADD upon ligand binding, causing either survival through derepression of NF-kappa-B or, alternatively, caspase-8-mediated apoptosis. Systemic release of this molecule leads to intravascular blood clotting, increased vascule permeability, and other symptoms of septic shock. For 10 points, name this pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted primarily by macrophages and mast cells.

This man was known for his belief in the oracular powers of Napoleon’s Book of Fate. At one point, this man ordered the arrest of his rivals in the Riigi faction, an action which contributed to the defection from his movement and the formation of kamerero, or outlaw bands. An adherent of the Batuni oath, much of the prominence of this man was a result of letters published on his behalf by Karari Njama, and this associate of General China was eventually captured and interrogated by Ian Henderson, who later wrote a book about “The Hunt for,” this man. This leader of the Aberdare mountain guerillas convened the Mwathe meeting to form his country’s namesake Parliament which was to be the provisional government following the expulsion of the British. For ten points, identify this Kenyan guerilla fighter executed by the British, the foremost leader of the Mau Mau rebellion.

This event started after a signal given by a man who called himself "Marian Delgado." During this event, Richard Elrod tried to tackle Brian Flanagan, only to hit his head against a concrete wall and become paralyzed. A march led by RYM II took place during this event, which was organized by leaders such as Jeff Jones and John Jacobs. This "national action" mainly targeted the Gold Coast neighborhood, and was criticized for being "Custeristic" by Fred Hampton. Carried out by protesters wearing football helmets and wielding lead pipes, this event was promoted with the slogan "bring the war home," and began with protesters blowing up a statue commemorating the Haymarket riot. Taking place from October 8 to October 11 in Chicago, it saw the arrests of Mark Rudd and Bernadine Dohrn. For 10 points, name these violent 1969 protests instigated by the Weatherman.

Reactions that do not display this property are preferred at the site of the maximum Fukui functions. Class A ligands, as well as biologically relevant ligands that bond through oxygen, such as carboxylates, are bases that exhibit this property. Among 3d metal ions, this character correlates with an oxidation state of +3. This property can be defined as half of the difference between a molecule’s ionization energy and its activation energy, explaining its correlation to Mulliken electronegativity. Acids that exhibit this character have high-energy HOMOs and tend to react readily with hydroxide and the smaller halides; these acid-base interactions tend to generate soluble, colorless compounds and are highly ionogenic. For 10 points, name this property defined by Pearson acid-base theory that characterizes compounds that are small, weakly polarizable, and highly charged.

In the Netherlands, an 1874 law prohibiting this activity was passed at the instigation of Samuel van Houten, and a law further restricting it was instituted in 1889 following a government investigation into the Eel Revolt, in which police cracked down on the popular practice of pulling eels apart. The first law to restrict this activity in France was drawn up in 1841 by Louis Villerme, and the effect of that law against this activity was later strengthened in 1874 by a law introduced by Ambroise Joubert-Bonnaire. In England, a step towards regulating this activity was the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act of 1801, though more effective were the Factory Act of 1833, which instituted an inspection regime, and the Mining Act of 1842, which prohibited all women from working underground in addition to outlawing this kind of activity in the mines. For ten points, identify this activity, prohibited by the aforementioned legislation, which involves employing those below a certain age, usually in dangerous occupations.
