answer: The {Bronze Horseman}: A Petersburg Tale [accept The Copper Horseman or Mednyy vsadnik: Peterburgskaya povest’]

In a footnote to this work, the author claims that Mickiewicz’s depiction of the same event as this work, while beautiful, was inaccurate. This poem opens with a man standing on the shore imagining a time when “all flags will visit us/ and we will celebrate in freedom,” after thinking that Nature intends for him to carve a window. This work contains a famous passage expressing the poet’s love for a city possessed of an “Admiralty needle,” and this poem’s protagonist is alleged to have the name he does because the poet is comfortable with it, a reference to that poet’s earlier work. The protagonist of this work sits on a marble sentry lion looking at his lover’s house instead of the title character behind him. After the death of his lover Parasha in a flood, this poem’s protagonist goes mad and wanders the streets before confronting the title figure. For ten points, identify this poem in which Yevgeniy imagines the title equestrian statue of Peter the Great chasing him through the streets of St. Petersburg, a poem by Alexander Pushkin.

answer: {radiative} transfer

Simulation of this process can be facilitated with the “on-the-spot” approximation for the local diffuse field. A general solution for the dispersion function in this process is the so-called H-function developed by Chandrasekhar. Angle cosines of plus and minus one over root 3 are commonly used in the two-stream approximation for this process, which can be extended to the Eddington approximation of near-isotropy at large depth. Its grey approximation assumes a frequency-independent opacity, and its fundamental equation sets the source function minues the intensity equal to the derivative of the intensity with respect to the optical depth. It occurs in a diffusive fashion as the dominant energy transport mechanism in non-convective regions of stars. For 10 points, name this process of absorption and emission into a beam of light passing through a medium.

A framework for calculating risk capital for a firm by using the cost of its implicit guarantees to its subsidiaries was developed by Perold and this economist. The Jarrow-Turnbull model uses random interest rates to extend the framework of this man's namesake model, which uses the idea that a call option can represent a company's equity to assess its risk. The maximization of expected lifetime utility with respect to the allocation of wealth between equity and risk-free assets is known as the namesake portfolio problem of this economist. This member of the failed LTCM hedge fund may be better remembered for enhancing the option-pricing model developed by two of his colleagues. For 10 points, name this economist in mathematical finance who sometimes lends his name to the Black-Scholes model, the son of the author of Social Theory and Social Structure.

A temporary blow against the interests of this organization was dealt by forces under Pierre de Troyes and Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville. This organization was created through the efforts of Pierre Radisson and Medard Chouart, with considerable assistance from Henry Bennet. A settlement of this organization was destroyed by men from a rival organization under the leadership of Cuthbert Grant in a skirmish that resulted in the death of Robert Semple, the chief governor of this organization’s North American territories. Five years after the Seven Oaks Massacre, this organization merged with a rival group led by Thomas Selkirk, the North West Company, and the territories it controlled were known as Rupert’s Land, since Prince Rupert of the Rhine was a major stockholder and public figure of this organization. Its basic unit of the organization was a canoe brigade of a few dozen voyageurs, who traded its namesake point blankets for furs. For 10 points, identify this British trading company active in the fur trade around its titular Canadian geographical location.

One treaty signed in this city was a direct response to the recently-signed Treaty of Tilsit and was negotiated by Charles Metcalfe. In the 17th century, this city was fortified against invasion by a defensive wall, whose outline remains in this city’s Circular Road. Battles fought around this city include the 1621 battle of Rohilla and the 1757 battle of Gohalwar against the forces of Ahmad Shah Duranni, and in 1805 this city became the capital of a kingdom after its capture following the battle of Lohgarh. Founded on land granted by the Mughal Emperor Akbar, this city was orignally named Ramdaspur but was renamed after its central “Pool of Nectar.” This city was home to a separatist group which was targeted by Operation Blue Star. This city, once he capital of a kingdom ruled by Ranjit Singh, is home to the Jallianwalla Bagh park, which was the site of an incident that led to the Hunter Commission investigation and resulted in the retirement of Reginald Dyer after his troops fired on civilians in this city. Founded by the guru Ram Das, for ten points, identify this city in Punjab holy to Sikhism and home to the Golden Temple, the site of a 1919 massacre.

The Wiechert and Parrish groups pioneered the use of S-proline as a catalyst in this reaction. One reagent is replaced by 1,3-dichloro-cis-2-butene in the Wichterle modification, and this reaction’s second step may be replaced with a Dieckmann condensation in a similar reaction named for Hauser. Though five stereogenic centers are generated during this reaction, only three are retained as end products as two are lost during dehydration. The original racemic Wieland-Miescher ketone is principally produced in this reaction, and an alpha-trimethlysilyl variant of one of its starting reactant can be used to prevent the side reaction of base-catalyzed polymerization of that reactant, methyl vinyl ketone. This reaction results in the formation of a bicyclic alpha-beta-unsaturated ketone. For 10 points, name this reaction consisting of a Michael addition followed by an aldol condensation.

answer: {serenade} [accept {serenade for strings} before ‘ speech ’]

One composition of this type in E minor consists of three short movements opening with an Allegro piacevole, and was dedicated to the philosopher W.H. Winfield. Another of these compositions opens with a first-movement “piece in the form of a sonatina” and was written a style based on the composer’s idol, Mozart.

This poem describes an “idling Spirit” which searches for mirrors of itself everywhere and “makes a toy of thought.” The speaker of this poem pretended to study his books while he was actually lost in thought, but notes that when his door opened, “I snatched / A hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up / For still I hoped to see the stranger’s face.” Its speaker recalls “my sweet birthplace, and the old church tower / Whose bells, the poor man’s only music, rang / from morn to evening,” and is disappointed that he grew up “In the great city, pent ‘mid cloisters dim,” but takes comfort in the prospect of his son growing up in the countryside. The speaker broods over a film fluttering on a grate due to a low flame, while the title object of this poem “performs its secret ministry / Unhelped by any wind.” For 10 points, name this nocturnal poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

The “younger house” of this dynasty began with the fourth rule to bear its dynastic name, a son of Alberto Azzo II, duke of Este, while the “elder house,” of this dynasty appears to originate with a man whose daughters Judith and Emma married Louis the Pious and Louis the German, respectively. Rulers from this family included Rudolf I of Burgundy, while another ruler of this dynasty went to war against his former wife Matilda of Tuscany, and this dynasty included a duke of Saxony who was atypically friendly with Frederick Barbarossa named Henry the Lion. This family’s Hanoverian branch produced the royal line of England beginning with George I, and their chief medieval stronghold was Bavaria. For ten points, identify this German dynasty, whose rivalry with the Hohenstaufen emperors caused them to be viewed as supporters of the papacy in Italy.

The author of this work speaks of “the woman-god [who] demands our veneration, the god-like woman [who] kindles our love” while describing a statue which he believes represents Juno Ludovisi. One section of this work argues that only the title kind of “disposition of the soul,” gives birth to liberty, pointing out that “the delightfull flower... will never unfold itself in the case of the Troglodyte.” The 19th section of this work distinguishes between two different states of passive and active capacity, arguing that the opposition between those states “preserves an entire freedom between them both,” while earlier, the author postulates a dialectic between the sensuous drive and the formal drive. This work’s last section advocates a “dynamic state of rights of man,” which leads to the “realm of the beautiful,” in which man appears to man, “only... as an object of free play.” For ten points, identify this series of epistles on the philosophy of art, written to the author’s patron, the Duke of Augustenberg by Friedrich Schiller.

Given integers a and b, this function on the quantity a to the n plus b to the n is divisible by n. The values of this function are given by the Möbius transform on the sequence of positive integers. For all n greater than 1, the splitting field of the polynomial [x to the n] minus 1 equals this function of n. This function on n can be calculated as the product of n and the quantity 1 minus p for all primes p which divide n. For any integer a relatively prime to n, a to the power of this function of n is equivalent to 1 mod n by a corollary of Lagrange’s theorem. For a prime number p, this function is equal to p minus 1, since p has no divisors except 1 and itself. For 10 points, name this function on an integer n representing the number of integers less than and relatively prime to n.

This doctrine got its name from the “Letter to the Smyrneans” written by Ignatius of Antioch, in which he disagreed with those who held this position and said that they also refrained from prayer. Irenaeus wrote that Simon Magus espoused a version of this doctrine, which is directly at odds with John 1:14 and several other passages from John’s Gospel. Found in such texts as the Gospel of Peter and popular among most Gnostics, this Christological doctrine which differs from Adoptionism has sometimes been theorized to derive from purely dualistic separation of matter and spirit, and those who held this doctrine rejected the Eucharist and the resurrection. Deriving from Greek meaning “to seem,” for 10 points, identify this notion that Christ’s death on the cross was an illusion, since he was never truly human.

The cutaneous form of this system was first proposed by Slominski and was confirmed by the presence of molecules like POMC in the skin. This system is hyperactivated by epigenetic downregulation of NGFI-A, and overactivation of this system is responsible for alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome. This system’s downstream target is the MC2 receptors of one of its namesake components. A test for dysregulation of this systtem involves the administration of dexamethasone, which acts as a negative regulator in this pathway. Activation of this pathway is initiated by the release, from the paraventricular nuclei of one of its components, of corticotropin-releasing factor.

The painter is Serge, who is introduced by the unusually named Russian, Nicolas Delmar. The protagonist’s actual name, Sophia, is revealed as she recalls being asked “Why didn’t you drown yourself in the Seine?” on her return to London, after which she used a “two-pound-ten” a week legacy to try to drink herself to death. “It Was All Due To An Old Fur Coat” is how a ten-day affair with the “mauvais garçon” gigolo, Réne, is summed-up by this novel’s protagonist, Sasha Jansen. For 10 points, identify this 1939 Jean Rhys novel that takes its paradoxical name from an Emily Dickinson poem.
