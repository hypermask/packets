During the early stages of this period, the caudillo Juan Alvarez led a guerilla uprising, and this period saw a major success for one side when Miguel Miramon abandoned the capital. One side during this period was motivated by the demands for fueros, or “privileges,” and this period saw a coup against a constitutional president by General Felix Zuloaga. This period saw the passage of a law restricting the ability of religious institutions to own land, sponsored by and named for Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, as well as the 1857 promulgation of a new constitution on the 47th anniversary of the Grito de Dolores. This period began with the issuance of the Plan of Ayutla against Santa Anna and ended with the deposition of Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada by Porfirio Diaz. For 10 points, identify this period of Mexican history mostly contemporaneous with the presidency of Benito Juarez, so named for the liberal legislation enacted throughout its duration.

answer: {solvation}

The Abraham parameters for this process can be combined into quantitative structure-activity relationships. The Eisenberg-McLachlan equation for finding the free energy of this process relies upon weighted input from five atom types. The Lee-Richards and Connolly accessible surface models, are, like molecular mechanics, used as the bases for the implicit or dielectric continuum models of this process. Such models, including the generalized Born model, tend to fail to predict the effects of molecules in the namesake “shell” or “cage” that this process causes to be formed around charged or nonpolar species. The enthalpy of this process is equivalent to the enthalpy of sublimation minus the enthalpy of solution. For 10 points, name this chemical process, the formation of attractions between solvents and solutes.

answer: {triple junctions}

The FFF and FRR types of these structures are always unstable, evolving to a different geometry, while the stable RRR form of these structures is hypothesized to have formed the Great Magnetic Bight. Observations of ephemeral thickening in the Franciscan Formation due to the migration of one of these structures led to a refinement of the slab window model known as the crustal conveyor model. A failed arm of an RRR one of these structures can host an aulacogen, a long-lived, subsiding sedimentary basin. One of these structures lies at the southern end of the Cascadia zone and at the northern end of the San Andreas Fault, and is the archetype of the fault-fault-trench form of these structures. Their other forms include ridge-ridge-ridge and ridge-trench-fault. For 10 points, name these locations where three tectonic plates meet.

answer: electron {dipole moment} of the {neutron} [prompt on partial answer]

The first measurement of this quantity was attempted by Purcell and Ramsey in 1950, although it was not until 1957 that the significance of this quantity was noted by Landau. The current upper limit on this quantity comes from an experiment at the Laue-Langevin Institute, which measures this quantity by detecting a shift in a transition frequency as an applied electric field is alternated between being parallel and anti-parallel to an applied magnetic field. In theoretical calculations, this quantity gives a direct measurement of the QCD vacuum angle. Because CP is a violated symmetry, according to the CPT theorem a nonzero measurement of this quantity would imply the existence of a corresponding time-reversal violation such that CPT is conserved. With a current upper bound of about 3 times 10 to the minus-26 power in units of elementary electron charge times centimeter, for 10 points, identify this vector quantity, which represents the bulk charge distribution of the lightest non-charged baryon.

This concept was the subject of the first work by historian Adrian Sherwin-White, who described how formal documentation of this first appeared on a bronze tablet given to a unit of Spanish cavalrymen. This concept was subdivided into private and public aspects, and a letter of Philip V of Macedon records how this was available to manumitted slaves. This concept was extended by the Constitution of Antoninus, and one could lose this status if subjected to an interdiction from fire and water. In the early days of this status, those who possessed a limited variety of it were denied the ius honorum and ius connubii, while those who enjoyed its full privileges were termed civis optimio iure. The Social War was fought over the failure to extend this status to the Marsi and the Samnites. For 10 points, identify this status, possessing which would render unto one all the privileges associated with living in a certain polity.

Swofford and Olsen described the use of parsimony analysis based on these events to provide a less noisy alternative to standard parsimony analysis for distantly related taxa. Kimura’s two-parameter model improved on the Jukes-Cantor model by introducing a term to account for the unexpected rarity of these events. In E. coli, the mutY, mutM, and mutT gene products are required for to prevent these events because of their ability to recognize 8-oxo-guanine. The “hotspot arginines” of p53 are affected by these events in lung cancer due to o-quinones and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The missense mutation that causes sickle-cell anemia is also this type of mutation. Aflatoxin B1 causes these mutations because it creates abasic sites at guanines, which are most often filled in with adenine. For 10 points, name this less-common type of nucleotide substitution in which a pyrimidine is mutated to a purine or vice versa.

answer: The {Question Concerning Technology} [or {Die Frage nach der Technik} ]

The opening section of this work notes that “for centuries philosophy has taught that there are four causes,” and claims that “the causa efficiens… sets the standard for all causality.” This work twice quotes Holderlin to say “But where danger is, grows the saving power also,” and once more to remind us that “poetically dwells man upon this earth,” linking the poetical to the ekphanestaton of Plato’s Phaedrus. According to this work, the essence of the title concept lies in Enframing, and the etymology of the title concept as a term “for the arts of the mind,” is explored in connection to the episteme, leading to the statement that the title concept is a mode of revealing. As an example of the titular concept, this essay presents the “monstrousness” of a hydroelectric power plant situated on the Rhine, and it concludes with the statement that because of our preoccupation with the title concept, “we no longer guard and preserve the coming to presence of art.” Resulting from a 1953 lecture to the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts, for 10 points, identify this Martin Heidegger essay that interrogates the products of modern science.
