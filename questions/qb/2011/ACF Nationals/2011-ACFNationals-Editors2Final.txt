answer: "The {American Scholar} "

This work prizes "blood-warm" writing about common things such as "The meal in the firkin; the milk in the pan" over the cold and remote style of Pope, Johnson, and Gibbon. It attacks the "mischievous notion" that "the world was finished a long time ago," instead claiming that great thinkers mold the perception of nature, asserting "wherever Macdonald sits, there is the head of the table." This work argues that the precepts "Know thyself" and "study nature" are really one maxim, and calls nature, books, and action the three main influences on the its central figure. This speech begins by telling a fable about Man being divided into many different parts, and argues that the right state of the title figure is "Man thinking." It ends by claiming "we have listened too long to the courtly muses of Europe," causing Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. to call this speech a "literary declaration of independence." For 10 points, name this speech delivered to the Phi Beta Kappa society of Harvard in 1837 by Ralph Waldo Emerson, which called for an original national literature.

answer: {steric} factor or {steric} condition

In the Hansch equation, the desired concentration of a drug is expressed in terms of the solubility of the drug, the sensitivity of the reaction to electron density, and THIS factor, and the delta term in the Taft equation describes an equivalent property. For a homonuclear molecule, it can be expressed as one minus cosine gamma, where two gamma is the opening angle of the cone of acceptance for the reaction. This property is unusually above unity in harpoon reactions. It approximately represents the ratio of the collisional cross section to the total cross section, and the pre-exponential factor of the Arrhenius equation is the product of this value and the collision frequency. The value of this term is increased by catalysts that orient reactants to promote product formation. For 10 points, name this term from collision theory that describes the probability that molecules will collide in the correct orientation and position for the reaction to proceed as desired.

answer: {dueling}

Early guidelines for this practice were authored by Andrea Alciati, while Girolamo Muzio’s 1550 treatise on this practice was the most popular of its time. In its 24th session, the Congress of Trent condemned this practice, branding it a “detestable custom... [which] shall be uprooted from Christian soil.” Fracois de Montmorency-Bouteville was executed by Louis XIII for engaging in this practice, which had been outlawed by Henry IV in 1608. This practice also came under attack from the jurist Jean de Savaron, who had argued that it was responsible for twice as many deaths as the French Wars of Religion, while Montesquieu’s Persian Letters satirized this practice as the only way for French aristocrats to resolve differences arising from a “point of honor.” The prevalence of this practice in post-Elizabethan England may have come from both an inflation of honors and the proliferation of rapiers, and those engaging in this practice were typically accompanied by a “second.” For ten points, identify this cultural practice once popular in Europe which consisted of defending one’s honor in combat, typically with guns or swords.

answer: {mikve} or {miqvah} [prompt on “{Jewish ritual bath}” or similar]

The use of this object is one of the central ideas behind adherence to the regulation of taharat hamishpahah. The requirements for the use of one of these objects is outlined in the Niddah tractate, where the use of this object is mandated on the “white day.” Although the original use of these objects was probably restricted to those who were about to partake in the terumah offerings, their use later became more widespread and their construction was supervised by the bet din. The construction of one of these objects is described in the sixth tractate of the Tohorot section of the Mishnah, which states that one of these objects must be either carved out of rock or built into the ground and have a capacity of no less than about 100 gallons. Intended for use after contact with a corpse or after emission of bodily fluids, as during sex, menstruation, or childbirth, for ten points, identify this object, a bath used in Jewish tradition for ritual purification.

answer: George {Balanchine} [or Georg Melitonovitch {Balanchivadze} ]

This artist choreographed the final collaboration between Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht, The Seven Deadly Sins. This artist choreographed the "water nymph ballet" for The Goldwyn Follies, as well as a ballet in which the Hoofer falls for the Stripper, only for her to be shot by the Boss. This choreographer's characteristic style emphasizes open arm positions broken at the wrist. Many of this choreographer's ballets were created for Suzanne Farrell, including an abstract work separated into the movements Emeralds, Rubies, and Diamonds. This choreographer of Jewels included extremely rapid footwork in many of his ballets, including Slaughter on Tenth Avenue. He was the balletmaster of the Ballets Russes from 1924 until 1929, before Lincoln Kirstein invited him to the United States. For 10 points, name this choreographer who founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet.

answer: {Federalist Paper #10}

This document was first cited by the Supreme Court in 1974’s Storer v. Brown, which upheld a California law prohibiting independent candidates who had been members of a party for less than a year prior to an election from being on the ballot. Noting that “no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause,” this work offers up the example of legislation regarding debts, this work criticizes “theoretic politicians,” who believe that material equality will lead to uniformity of opinion. This work defines its central concept as a group of citizens “united... by some common impulse,” and argues that the two methods of “curing the mischief” of such groups are to remove its causes and control its effects. Addressed to the people of New York by James Madison writing as “Publius,” this work concludes by arguing that the advantage enjoyed by a republic over a democracy is likewise enjoyed by a large republic over a small one. For ten points, identify this Federalist Paper which argues that “a well constructed Union,” will “break and control the violence of faction.”

answer: Uncle {Toby} [or {Toby} Shandy]

The sudden arrival of a midwife inspires this character to discuss a "sailing chariot" built by his favorite author, Stevinus. He tells his family that he first realized he was in love when a blister on his ass burst, and often expresses displeasure by whistling "Lillibulero." This character's gentleness is illustrated by a story in which he asks a buzzing fly "Why should I hurt thee? This world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me." The eighth and ninth books of the novel he appears in focus on the amorous pursuit of this character by the Widow Wadman. He recovers from an injury he received at the Battle of Namur by reenacting battles on his bowling green, an example of this character's hobby-horse. This brother of Walter is served by Corporal Trim. For 10 points, name this comedic character created by Laurence Sterne, the uncle of Tristram Shandy.

answer: {maternal effect} genes

The putative transcriptional regulator Stella is a rare mammalian example of this class of genes. In Xenopus, the presence of CPEs in the 3-prime untranslated regions of these genes is required for their maturation and polyadenylation. Dextral versus sinistral curling of Limnaea shells is a classic example of this type of phenotypic regulation. Staufen is required to anchor some morphogens of this type after they are transferred through ring canals. The genes that define the anterior-posterior axis in Drosophila exhibit this effect when mutated; they may be transcribed in nurse cells before being transported to the site of their activity. For 10 points, name this class of genes distinct from zygotically acting genes that produce a phenotype in offspring despite being expressed by the mother.

answer: {structural functionalism} [or word forms of {function} ]

In the 1980s, Jeffrey Alexander relaxed this perspective's traditional assumptions to develop a "neo" version of it. Gabriel Almond adapted this perspective to political science in order to compare different political systems. An influential version of this perspective analyzed systems using five pairs of "pattern variables" such as "diffuseness and specificity" and "ascription and achievement." An essay by Kingsley Davis and Wilbur Moore used this perspective to propose a positive model of social stratification. This perspective dominated American sociology from the 1930s to the 1970s in part because it was supported by the theories of Robert Merton and Talcott Parsons. It considers society to be a biological organism consisting of interrelated parts. For 10 points, name this major macro-level sociological paradigm, one of the three dominant perspectives of sociology along with conflict theory and symbolic interactionism.

One thinker with this surname critiqued the logical foundations of the Principia Mathematica and argued that the a priori is that “which is true no matter what,” in his paper, “A Pragmatic Conception of the A Priori.” That thinker with this surname distinguished between four modes of meaning: denotation, comprehension, signification, and intension, in his 1946 book Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation, and he further developed his idea of “conceptual pragmatism,” in Mind and the World Order. Another thinker with this surname argued for a type-type psychophysical identity that he originated with David Armstrong in the paper “Mad Pain and Martian Pain,” and defended his theory of modal realism in the 1986 book On the Plurality of Worlds. That thinker’s best-known philosophical work uses possible-world semantics to analyze conditionals of the form “if p it would have been the case that q;” that book is Counterfactuals. For ten points, identify this surname shared by American philosophers Clarence Irving and David Kellogg.

One of these works is in black and white and reveals in white its subject’s face and neck, at the base of which is a multifaceted jewel which gives that work its alternate title, “The Broach.” These works were produced contemporaneously with their creator’s The Day After, and one of these works was exhibited in Leipzig next to the same artist’s Ashes. Another work in this series shows its subject with closed eyes and a red halo around the head which is tilted back and supported by the right arm while the left arm is behind the lower back. Several works in this series feature a homunculus in the lower left corner and are framed by a red border on which sperm are painted; one of those works in this series is entitled “Conception.” Models for these works included Eva Mudocci and Dagny Juel, both of whom were erstwhile mistresses of these works’ creator. Part of their creator’s Frieze of Life, for ten points, identify these lithograph prints all of which depict a single, sometimes nude, woman, created by the painter of The Scream.

One leader of this organization advocated the idea of “insurrection rather than war” as a counterpoint to the ideas of a similar group at the Congress of Stuttgart. A military conflict involving the country where this organization was located caused it to support a “sacred union” with some of its political opponents. During one of its high points, this organization formed a coalition government with the Popular Republican Movement, but not long after this organization’s former leader Daniel Mayer left it to form the Union of Democratic Forces. This organization was formed from the merger of two others, one of which was led by Jules Guesde and Edouard-Marie Vaillant, and until 1914, it was headed by L’Humanite co-founder Jules Jauret, who was assassinated for pursuing a pacifist policy with regard to Germany. For ten points, identify this political organization home to Lionel Jospin and Francois Mitterand, which was the largest component of the Popular Front government of Leon Blum.

answer: The {Suppliant Women} or The {Suppliants} or {Hiketides}

In one speech in this work, a character draws an analogy between this work’s plot and the war between hawks and doves, asking, “If bird prey on bird, how can it be pure?” In this work, a herald orders a group of characters to board a ship, but they refuse, cursing him to perish in “the sandy tomb of Sarpedon.” As an attempt to gain sympathy, one character in this work orders some wands to be placed on the altars of his city, later reminding its residents that if they fail to offer protection, Zeus will send a monster to plague it. One of the title characters of this work recounts her origins in the tale of Io and her son Epaphus, whose grandson Belus was the father of the title characters, who in this play seek refuge with the Argive king Pelasgus. This play opens with an invocation by the chorus to protect the title characters, who have fled from their home because they were about to be forced to marry the sons of Aegyptus. For ten points, identify this play which was followed by the lost plays The Egyptians and The Danaids, written by Aeschylus about the titular daughters of Danaus.

answer: {types} [{generously} prompt on “{classes}”]

An algorithm for making inferences on these objects by reducing such an inference to a unification problem was discovered by Damas, Hindley, and Milner. Extensions of this concept include the System F formulated by Girard and Reynolds. In one system, this concept was introduced to avoid the problem of the proposition, “given some X it is not the case that X applies to itself,” as pointed out by Kleene and Rosser. To resolve the problem of a contradiction obtained from Cantor’s theorem which states that no mapping from a set to its power set could be surjective, these objects were introduced by Russell in Appendix B of the Principia. Originally absent from the lambda calculus, checking for usage violations by making sure that arguments to functions have the correct value for this property is a crucial step in the compilation process, and applying the same function to variables with different values for this property is the basis for polymorphism. For ten points, identify these mathematical objects useful in computer science and which in many languages include integers, Booleans, and strings.

answer: {Soul} on {Ice}

This book argues that the Twist's popularity among young whites stems from their desire to reconnect with their alienated bodies in its essay "Convalescence." It quotes Rufus Scott's line "you took the best so why not take the rest" to contrast James Baldwin’s homosexuality with the masculinity of Richard Wright in its essay "Notes on a Native Son." This book asserts that societies separated by class divide into the sexual archetypes of the Omnipotent Administrator, who desires the lower-class Amazon, and the Supermasculine Menial, who desires the higher-class Ultrafeminine. Including essays such as "The White Race and Its Heroes" and "The Primeval Mitosis," this book begins by describing its author's decision to rape white women as an "insurrectionary act," and was written in the 1960s during its author's time in Folsom State Prison. For 10 points, name this essay collection by Eldridge Cleaver.

answer: {dog}

In Nahuatl, animals of this kind that had ritual significance were called Itzcuintli, while ordinary ones were known as chichimeh. According to the Popol Vuh, these animals teamed up with turkeys to kill the people of the second age who abused them. The man and woman Tata and Nene were turned into these creatures by Tezcatlipoca, who cut off their heads and sewed them onto their rumps while the Hero Twins sacrificed one of these animals and brought it back to life to impress One-Death and Seven-Death. The Maya believed these animals to be psychopomps and thus buried their dead with bodies of these animals, while the Tzotzil and Tzeltal held that a yellow one of these creatures mated with Eve to produce Indians. These creatures are most associated with a god who turned into a maize sprout, a maguey plant, and a salamander in order to elude Death. For ten points, identify these animals of Mesoamerican myth, most often associated with Quetzlcoatl’s twin, the god Xolotl, and which in Incan myth were sacrificed to Ilyapa.

The last recorded ruler of these people was Palakus, and another of their notable rulers was Ateas, who was killed fighting Philip II of Macedon. Following a brief war with Odrysia, this group established a protectorate over Olbia, and their other notable military achievements include a victory over an army led by Kastaritu, who had besieged Nineveh, as well as forcing Psamtik I of Egypt to pay them tribute. A characteristic feature of the culture of these peoples was their burial mound, or kurgan, which served as the sources for their distinctive zoomorphic art. Most of these kurgans were located in the place identified by Herodotus as Gerrhi, the burial place of their kings, located in the lower Dnieper valley. These people first moved west during the 8th century B.C.E., displacing the Cimmerians, and were themselves supplanted by the Sarmatians. For ten points, identify these Iranian peoples who established a long-lasting empire in southeast Russia and fought with the Medes and Persians.

answer: the {string quartets} of Joseph {Haydn} [prompt on partial answer]

One of these works is nicknamed because the bariolage in its final movement resembles the croaking of a frog. Another of these pieces includes a third act minuet often called the "witches' canon," and is nicknamed for the repeated motifs of descending fifths in its first movement. A third of these pieces ends with a coda that comically separates a silly theme into four parts using two-bar rests, causing it to be known as "The Joke." Their composer wrote the earliest of them as five-movement divertimenti before he moved on from the prevailing galant style to write ones that give each instrument its own voice. The third of the opus 76 "Erdody" ones features an adagio consisting of variations on "Deutschland, deutschland uber alles," and is nicknamed the "Emperor." For 10 points, name these pioneering pieces of chamber music written by the composer of the Drumroll and Surprise symphonies.

The final poem in this work, “Newcomer,” repeats the phrase “time for worship” before asking “Anna of the panel oblongs” to “protect me from them fucking angels.” In the introduction to this work, its author claimed that it was originally conceived as an Easter sequence, and the Christian imagery in this work includes repeated references to the poet as “prodigal,” as well as a stanza in which “John the Baptist [comes] with bowl of salt water, preaching the gambit: life without sin, without life.” That imagery is contained in this work’s second part, “Initiation,” while its third part describes a “lioness, crowned with moonlight,” and is entitled “Watermaid.” In the first part of this work, entitled “Passage,” the poet envisions himself naked, “leaning on an oilbean,” in front of “mother Idoto,” and later as a “watchman for the watchword,” at the title location. Published in the same year as its author’s Limits, this collection appeared in Black Orpheus in 1962, five years before its author would be killed fighting in Biafra. For ten points, identify this poetic cycle in five parts written by Christopher Okigbo.

In the DisPerSE formalism developed by Sousbie, et. al. these structures are analogous to ascending 3-manifolds. Models in which these structures mimic dark energy acceleration have been proposed as alternatives to Lambda-CDM, but such models suffer from the fact that they violate homogeneity and require excessive fine-tuning. One of these structures found in the Eridanus constellation corresponds directly to the “cold spot” in the WMAP images, and that structure may have produced the aforementioned “cold spot” via a late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. These regions are complementary to superclusters, and prime examples of these include the complement to the Local Group as well as the filament of the Perseus-Pisces cluster. For ten points, identify these cosmic regions of the universe which are nearly empty of observable matter.
