answer: {carbenes}

One of these compounds isolated by Bertrand features a carbon bonded to a phosphorus and a silicon and is sometimes referred to as the “push-pull” type of these. Either a cyanide anion or one type of these can serve as the catalyst for the benzoin condensation and the Stetter reaction. That type is most often produced by deprotonating an azolium salt and is the N-heterocylic type of these compounds. The Wanzlick equilibrium describes the dimerization of relatively stable ones, and Arduengo is credited with isolating the first stable crystalline ones. They can be formed via the photolysis of diazoalkanes, and they can be added to alkenes to form cyclopropanes in the Simmons-Smith reaction. One of these attaches to a ruthenium atom in a catalyst for olefin metathesis, Grubbs’ catalyst, and complexes involving these and metals include the Fischer and Schrock varieties. Existing in singlet and triplet states, for 10 points, name these neutral species in which a divalent carbon has two unshared electrons.

answer: {Tajikistan}

The Marguzor lakes lie along the Archimaydan River in the Fann Mountains in this country. This nation contains the world’s tallest artificial dam, the Nurek Hydroelectric Dam, which lies on the Vakhsh River, and its Yakshu Valley was once the site of substantial gold mining. This nation’s eastern region, serviced as of 2004 by a single main road, is its poorest; that region is Gorno-Badakshan. This nation is home to multiple organizations, such as the Hizb-ut-Tahrir and the Islamic Renaissance Party, agitating for the establishment of an Islamic state. Historically, power in this nation has been concentrated around Khojent, which is closer to a neighboring state’s Fergana Valley, and this nation shares its southern border, defined by the Panj River, with Afghanistan. This nation is also home to a mountain system whose central massif is dominated by the Fedchenko glacier, and which drains much of its melt into the Amu Darya. For 10 points, identify this Central Asian nation also home to Mt. Isamil Samani, formerly Communism Peak, in the Pamir Range, which has its capital at Dushanbe.

This leader’s raising of soldiers’ pay by 50 percent caused a monetary crisis in which he avoid debasing the currency by reducing the weight of the aureus and introducing a silver coin which weighed almost a gram less than the equal value of two denarii coins. One construction project during the reign of this husband of Fulvia Plautilla included a 12-foot-tall statue of Asclepius, a copy of the Farnese Hercules, and the Farnese Bull. He cut off an indecisive campaign in the agri decumates region and abandoned the Caledonian campaign shortly after reaching his highest post. This ruler, a worshipper of Serapis who was the only emperor to be depicted as a pharaoh, murdered his brother Geta, allegedly while the latter was in the arms of their mother, Julia Domna.

At its beginning, Jean Lannes’ men, who initiated this battle during a dense fog, were flanked on the left by Augereau and followed by the VI Corps under Michel Ney; later, Lannes aided Ney after Ney attacked the enemy center without being ordered to do so. Carl von Clausewitz was captured by the victors at this battle, fought south of the Ilm river and west of the Saale.

answer: magnetic vector {potential} [accept {A}-{field} until read; prompt on partial answers]

When multiplied by charge, the difference between this quantity and the momentum three-vector is in turn multiplied by a vector whose components are matrices, symbolized sigma, on the left side of the bra-ket in the Pauli equation. This quantity is sometimes given as a function equaling q beta over r minus beta-dot-r, where beta is velocity divided by the speed of light, in a relativistically corrected model named for Liénard and Wiechert. When this is nonzero, its path integral is proportional to phase shifts in the wavefunctions of electrons moving past solenoids, according to a phenomenon first predicted by Ehrenberg and Siday in the absence of external fields; that phenomenon is the Aharaonov-Bohm effect. Setting the Laplacian of this quantity equal to the negative of permeability times current density makes the divergence of this quantity equal zero, which is called the Coulomb gauge. For 10 points, name this field symbolized A whose curl gives the magnetic field.

During one battle, this state’s army formed a tight wall of spearmen around firing archers for four days to thwart the attack plans of Vahan the Armenian, whom they defeated on the sixth day. Ten rules of military conduct issued by this state’s first leader include a ban on burning trees and harming enemy livestock. One general of this state eliminated the Rai dynasty by capturing Kerman and Makran at the same time that this state besieged Sistan, and the armies of this state often used elite warriors who would seek out enemy champions and duel them, known as mubarizun.

This author wrote three poems on the death of a girl almost six years old, one of which concludes, “press not heavy on her, O earth; she pressed but lightly on you.” The image of a lion who spares a hare features prominently in a set of eight of his poems, and Tom Brown’s rhyme “I do not love thee, Dr. Fell, / The reason why I cannot tell” is said to be a translation of one of this man’s poems. In addition to three poems on the death of Erotion, he wrote many poems addressed to a friend who shared his name, one of which laments that the need for patronage prevents the two of them from “enjoy[ing their] days together free from care.” Another poem addressed to that friend lists among the things that make life happy “wealth not gained by labour, but inherited” and “neither to fear death nor seek it,” while a poem addressed to Licinianus extols the virtues of his native Spain.

One method of generating one of these constructs is to use Thompson’s Construction to create an intermediate structure, then construct the power set of those states. Every “intrinsic,” or “minimal” one of these structures has an associated syntactic monoid, and these constructs are classified as either Moore or Mealy types depending on what sort of function gives their output. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm generates one of these constructs, which it uses to perform a string search. A set of symbols that brings one of these to an accepting state is said to belong to its language, and it is impossible to construct one of these objects, which does not accept a regular language as a consequence of the Pumping Lemma. These objects are formally defined by specifying a finite alphabet, a set of states, and a transition function between those states.

In 1969, Stiglitz showed that the assumption that each entity belonged to a “risk class” was not essential in proving this economic result. Jensen and Meckling argued that agency-costs exist due to the asset substitution problem in challenging an assumption of this result, which was explained by one of its developers by the analogy of a gigantic tub of whole milk. The second proposition associated with this economic result is that there is no optimal dividend payout ratio payout, while its first proposition originally assumed that there are no bankruptcy costs, no asymmetric information, and no taxes, and showed the irrelevance of leverage in determining the value of a company.

Surface markers on these cells include both CD56 and a molecule, which performs the classical ADCC mechanism, the Fc-receptor molecule CD16. Other surface molecules on them, such as CD94, Ly49, KIR, and KAR, are inhibitory receptors that recognize major histocompatibility complex class 1; they do not express TCR or surface CD3.

Peirce attributes the project of grammatica speculativa or “pure grammar” to this philosopher, and Heidegger’s habilitation dissertation is mistakenly titled after this philosopher’s theory of categories and meaning. It turns out that he didn’t write De modis significandi by Thomas of Erfurt, but he did introduce the concept of a non-qualitative property responsible for individuation, a haecceity.
