answer: {Landau} theory of phase transitions [ also accept: {Ginzburg-Landau theory} of {phase transitions} if given but do not accept Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity or anything that mentions superconductivity ]

Because this theory is a mean-field theory, its validity is limited to regions in which the mean-square fluctuation of its central quantity over the correlation volume is small. When applied to magnetization, the cubic term in this theory’s central expansion goes to zero because magnetization must be invariant under time reversal. The central quantity in this theory is non-zero in the unsymmetrical state and zero in the symmetrical state. In this theory, thermodynamic potentials are expanded in powers of the order parameter, and this theory can break down when the fluctuations around the critical point are too large, as they are around helium’s lambda point. For ten points, identify this eponymous theory which gives a phenomenological description of continuous phase transitions.

The ninth of these poems praises a woman who "shun'd the broad way and the green" to "labor up the Hill of heavenly truth," and is addressed to "a virtuous young lady." The seventh of these poems exclaims, "How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth / Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year?", while the thirteenth celebrates the "tuneful and well-measured song" of Henry Lewes. In the last of these poems, the speaker dreams of the return of "his late espoused Saint," only to end "But O as to embrace me she inclined / I woke, she fled, and day brought back my night." In the nineteenth of these poems, the speaker asks "does God exact day labour, light denied," and hears patience reply, "they also serve who only stand and wait." For ten points, name these fourteen-line poems, such as "When I consider how my light is spent," which were written by the author of Samson Agonistes and Paradise Lost.

answer: {intelligence tests} [do not accept or prompt on " intelligence "]

Anne Anastasi wrote a major 1954 text about these entities, and was known as the "guru" of them. Alan and Nadeen Kaufman used the CHC model to develop several of these entities, including the KABC and the KAIT. Robert Sternberg developed his triarchic theory because of his concerns that these entities are dissociated from the real world. Louis Thurstone applied multiple-factor analysis to these entities, causing him to posit seven "primary abilities." Many of them, such as Raven's Progressive Matrices, are based on Charles Spearman's concept of a general factor, or g. Stephen Jay Gould argued that the hereditarian interpretation of these entities in The Bell Curve promoted scientific racism in The Mismeasure of Man. For ten points, name these entities, such as ones named for Weschler and Stanford-Binet, which often measure IQ.

answer: {The Protocols of the Elders of Zion}

This book's comparison of newspapers to the hundred arms of Vishnu has led many scholars to argue that it was plagiarized from earlier texts. It was translated into English by Victor Marsden from the edition included as an appendix to The Great and the Small by Sergei Nilus. Much of it was adapted from The Dialogue in Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, a satire against Napoleon III by Maurice Joly. Philip Graves's articles attacking this book were cited in the 1934 Berne trial discrediting it. This book begins by claiming that "right lies in might," and argues that the "Symbolic Snake" is closing around Europe. It describes plans to create a world "super-government" and manufacture economic crises in order to destroy states, and was published by Henry Ford as The International Jew. For ten points, name this notorious anti-Semitic forgery about a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world.

answer: {pachytene} or {pachynema} [prompt on {prophase} I until “ {checkpoint} named for {this stage} ” is read; {don’t} prompt on {meiosis} or {meiosis} I at any point]

NDT80-mediated transcription of Polo-like kinase allows cells to exit from this stage, and Piwi-interacting RNAs are classified by whether they appear during or before this stage. In C. elegans, cells in this stage are located proximal to the transition zone. In many organisms, this stage can be distinguished by the presence of maximal SYP3 staining, which represents the assembly, upon bivalents (BIV-uh-lentz), of fully formed synaptonemal complexes. The trans face of the Golgi expands in size during this phase in males due to the synthesis of proacrosin and acrogranin. Defects in Holliday junction formation can trigger the checkpoint named for this stage, also called the recombination checkpoint, and exit from this stage is regulated by middle meiotic gene expression. For ten points, name this third stage of meiotic prophase 1 that precedes diplotene and follows zygotene.

answer: {Cambridge Platonists}

One member of this group argued that properties of space are analogous to the attributes of God in his Enchiridium metaphysicum. Another member of this group attacked the “Pharisaical Righteousness” of what he called “Scripture Christianity,” which he held to be as legalistic as Judaism, in a sermon collected in his Discourses. The most famous member of this group divided atheism into hylozoic, hylopatian, and cosmo-plastic variants, and argued that the so-called “Plastick Nature” of life was the medium by which God made his presence known in his creation. The work in which that philosophy is contained is entitled The True Intellectual System of the Universe, and other works by members of this group include A Discourse of the Freedom of the Will by Peter Sterry and the Aphorisms of Benjamin Whitcote. Including Nathaniel Culverwell and John Smith, and led by Henry More and Ralph Cudworth, for ten points, identify this group of English philosophers based out of a certain university.

David Graham Phillips argued that this politician and Arthur Gorman were the leaders of the "political trust" in "The Treason of the Senate." This senator became the chairman of the National Monetary Commission after the passage of an emergency currency act passed in response to the Panic of 1907, which was named for him and Edward Vreeland. In 1911, that commission produced this Republican's namesake economic plan, which became the basis for much of the Federal Reserve. His dominance of American economic policy during the 1890s and 1900s caused him to be nicknamed "the General Manager of the Nation." A politician named for this senator served as Governor of New York from 1958 to 1973 and was appointed as the vice president of Gerald Ford. For ten points, name this Republican senator from Rhode Island who wrote a 1909 tariff bill that was combined with a bill sponsored by Sereno Payne.
