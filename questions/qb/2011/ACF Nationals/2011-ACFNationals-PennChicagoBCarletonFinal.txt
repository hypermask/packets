answer: {neutral} theory or {neutral mutation-random drift} theory or {NM-RD} theory [ {generously} prompt on “ {molecular clock} ” at any point before it’s mentioned]

The McDonald-Kreitman test was originally used to test the validity of this theory, which is supported by the observation of third-position homoplasy. Its developer’s arguments for it centered on how the recently acquired Zuckerkandl-Pauling dataset could not be adequately explained by either Dobzhansky’s heterosis argument or Haldane’s substitution rate. Under this assumption, the fixation probability is inversely proportional to the effective population size. This theory is the foundation of the molecular clock method of dating species, and it serves as a null hypothesis in tests of selection. For 10 points, name this theory of molecular evolution proposed by Kimura that states that the majority of changes to an organism's genome have neither advantageous or disadvantageous effects on the organism.

answer: {kerplunk} experiment [prompt on anything having to do with {Watson’s rats} ]

Dennis and Gingerelli separately modified this experiment by introducing new objects to achieve the same result. Performed with grad student Harvey Carr, its results confirmed its main experimenter’s belief in the primacy of kinaesthetic feedback. This experiment supported its psychologist’s “chain of responses” hypothesis, which argued that only an initial stimulus was needed to produce responses, a result contrary to Thorndike’s Law of Effect. Published in a paper entitled “The Orientation of the White Rat,” it was performed in a straight-alley apparatus whose length was shortened by a half after rats were trained to run its initial length. For 10 points, name this experiment by JB Watson named for the sound rats made when colliding with the walls of the shortened maze.
