answer: Edouard {Lalo}

This composer wrote a violin concerto that ends on an arpeggio to be played detache. Another of his violin pieces begins with alternating allegretto non troppo and andante portions before leading into a 2/4 allegretto that includes a spicatto on a high E. Besides composing his Opus 20 violin concerto in F major and his Norwegian Fantasy, he wrote two rhapsodies based on music from his ballet Namouna. An unusual allegro presto occurs twice in the second movement of his Cello Concerto in D minor. His most performed composition was written in 1874 for Pablo de Sarasate, includes an often-omitted intermezzo as the third of its five movements, and is based on folk music from the Iberian peninsula. For 10 points, name this French composer of Symphonie Espagnole.

answer: {Livonian} War

During this war, journeyman goldsmith turned guerrilla leader Ivo Schenkenberg was nicknamed “Hannibal” and peasants defended the castle of Marienhausen by throwing rocks at their besiegers. The priest Silvester and Aleksei Adashev were charged with witchcraft for opposing this war, whose stated cause was arrears in tribute from the bishopric of Dorpat. After Stefan Batory recaptured Polotsk and began to besiege Pskov, the losing side in this war asked for a three-year truce. During this war, one side suffered attacks by the Crimean Tatars and created the oprichnina. The other side, a branch of the Teutonic Knights, transferred territory to Sweden and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. For 10 points, name this 16th-century war, Ivan the Terrible's attempt to secure access to the Baltic by seizing a Finnic-speaking region of present-day Latvia.

answer: {thymus}

Agnathans, which have a region of gill basket epithelia that expresses DLL-B, are the most basal organisms to possess an analogous structure to this organ. The expression of the AIRE transcription factor in medullar epithelial cells of these organs leads to the production of various proteins, including insulin and myelin basic protein. Concentric rings of epithelial cells in this organ are known as Hassall corpuscles. People with DiGeorge syndrome completely lack this organ. SCID or “nude” mice lack this organ and thus are incapable of rejecting tissue transplants due to compromised humoral immunity. In this tissue, cells expressing CD4 and/or CD8 that bind to self antigens are destroyed through negative selection. For 10 points, name this immunologically important organ located near the heart, the site of T-cell maturation.

answer: The {Loneliness} of the {Long Distance Runner}

In this work, a diagnosis of pleurisy keeps the narrator out of the army, which allows him to carry through with a lucrative plan conceived while carting dustbins and scrubbing floors as punishment. Earlier the main character walked in on his father's bloody corpse, but lived off ham sandwiches and lemonade from the resultant insurance money. The narrator of this work distinguishes himself from "In-laws," repeatedly describes the governor as potbellied and claims that "my own war's all that I'll ever be bothered about." This story's narrator splits seventy pounds with Mike, and declares he has a baker's dozen of thirteen witnesses for his alibi, including his mother's fancy-man. The Essex boys cheer him on at the end of this work in which he allows boys from Aylesham and Gunthorpe to pass him and take an All England Borstal Blue Ribbon Prize Cup. For 10 points, name this Allan Sillitoe story about a juvenile delinquent named Smith who throws a race to spite the authorities.

answer: The {Third Man}

In one scene in this movie, its antagonist compares people on the ground to dots, and asks the main character if he would refuse twenty thousand dollars for “every dot that stopped.” Its main character bewilders a meeting of the British Cultural Reeducation Service when he is unable to answer questions about stream-of-consciousness literature and James Joyce, and is then threatened by the thug Popescu. This film ends with an extended shot of a woman walking down a tree-lined road towards the main character, only to walk by without looking at him. Its main character helps Calloway corner its antagonist in the city sewers after confronts him about his penicillin racket while riding a Ferris wheel. Directed by Carol Reed, it is set in post-war Vienna, and climaxes with Holly Martins shooting the title character, who had earlier faked his death. Based on a script written by Graham Greene, for 10 points, name this film noir starring Orson Welles as the title character, Harry Lime.

answer: Jonas {Savimbi}

This man ordered an all-female firing squad to execute 17 Cuban prisoners at Gago Coutinho. The Halloween Massacre was an attack on this man's followers, who were known as the “kwacha” after the rooster symbol on the flag of his party. Franz Sitte praised the “kibbutz-like organization” around this man, whose headquarters at Lungue-Bungu was more convenient to the Chokwe and Lunda peoples than to his own early supporters, who were primarily the converts of Protestant missionaries among the Ovimbundu. His 1988 visit to the Reagan White House proved controversial because of the military support he received from apartheid South Africa. This man refused to accept the result of the 1992 election that he lost to Jose Eduardo dos Santos of the MPLA, and fought on for ten years before being ambushed and killed in the province of Moxico. For 10 points, name this leader of UNITA, an insurgent against the government of Angola.

This figure’s domicile experiences the four seasons simultaneously, one at each corner. In one story, this deity gives a wish-granting child named “Snotty-Nosed Brat” to a lumberjack in exchange for his firewood, but the lumberjack sends the child away after he runs out of wishes. In another story, this figure ordered one of his servants to capture a monkey in order to consume its liver, but after his servant failed he crushed all of its bones. This figure’s daughter, whose name meant “luminous jewel”, turned into a dragon after giving birth and flew away from her husband. In another story, this figure helped his son-in-law recover a fish-hook. One day within this figure’s palace is equivalent to one hundred years in the real world; that fact plays heavily into the legend of a fisherman who visited it, named Urashima Taro. This figure possessed a set of jewels that controlled the tides, and through his daughter Otohime and son-in-law Hoori, he is the great-grandfather of Jimmu Tenno. For 10 points, name this dragon, the Shinto god of the sea

A sexually dimorphic form of Pied Wheatear nests on this island. The city of Amathus was the last stronghold of this island's native language, which seems to have been spoken by a king named Purwos. An early disaster on this island resulted in the abandonment of the city of Enkomi, the site of a sanctuary to the “Ingot God.” Michael Katzev excavated a Hellenistic cargo ship wrecked off this island and usually named for the Kyrenia mountain range that forms its northern coast. The two British sovereign base areas of Dhekelia and Akrotiri are located on this island, which was the home of the EOKA resistance movement and Archbishop Makarios.

answer: {Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar}

This man's number is twice the magnetic energy density times the square of a typical length scale, all over the dynamic viscosity times the magnetic diffusivity. That dimensionless quantity named for this man appears in an equation modifying the critical Rayleigh number for convective instability in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. This man and Velikhov originated the study of the magnetorotational instability, and he derived an analytic approximation for the effects of dynamical friction, or gravitational drag. He introduced a tensor form of the virial theorem that includes his namesake potential energy tensor. He also considered relativistic effects on the stability of an n = 3 polytrope, deriving a critical value of approximately 5.83 over the square of the mean mass per electron in solar mass units. For 10 points, name this man who thus derived the upper mass limit for a white dwarf.

For an order-preserving map from a complete lattice to itself, the set of these entities is also a complete lattice, by the Tarski-Knaster theorem. One theorem on these entities gives as a corollary a theorem of Frobenius that a 3 by 3 matrix of positive real numbers has a positive real eigenvalue. Theorems named for Nielsen and Lefschetz count the number of these for a given mapping. The Mobius transformation has exactly two on the Riemann sphere, which are written explicitly in its normal form. For a group action, a given element acts as one of these for its stabilizers. Since there is no continuous retraction from the unit ball to its boundary, any continuous function from the unit ball to itself must have one of these, a result named for Brouwer. For 10 points, name these points that, for a given mapping, are mapped to themselves.

One of these objects in the village of Gudimallam is about ten feet tall, and is thought to be the oldest one found. The mukha type of these have faces carved in them. Mahakaleshwar is a temple dedicated to the jyotir type, and there are twelve main temples in all dedicated to that type. The base of these is called the Brahmabhaga, while offerings are placed on the top section called the Rudrabhaga. They are often bathed in water from the Ganges to reenact a story from the Ramayana. In multiple stories were it appears, two gods attempt to find its beginning or end, but fail to do so. One story of its origin is that, while trying to determine who should receive a sacrifice, the sage Bhrigu cursed the god it represents to be worshipped in this form. For 10 points, name this object representing a flaming pillar or the phallus of Shiva.

answer: {Bacon's} Rebellion

One contemporary observer of this event wrote that “I am sorry at my heart, that lice and flux should do the hangman's part.” A violent act during this event was a march into the Great Dragon Swamp made by a man who perpetrated a massacre against the Occaneechees. It began with a conflict between Giles Brent and some Doegs that shortly spread to the Susquehannocks; its leader did not care, because he believed in war “against all Indians in general for that they were all enemies.” That leader also criticized the monopoly over the beaver trade in his “Declaration of the People.” Residents of New Kent county discontented with the conditions of tobacco farming provided much of the manpower for this attempt to overthrow the Green Spring faction of Governor William Berkeley. For 10 points, name this 1676 uprising that led to the burning of Jamestown.

answer: {nitro} group

In the polymerization of polyetherimides, this compound is surprisingly readily displaced by bisphenolate ion. One of the few organic compounds to contain this functional group is chloroamphenicol, in which it is found as an aryl substituent. Its use in organic syntheses stems from the fact that it can react with an aldol or ketone to form a carbon-carbon bond in the Henry reaction as well as act as a Michael donor in 1,4-Michael additions. As a substituent on benzene rings, it acts a strong deactivating group and as a director of meta substitution. This functional group can be reduced to a primary amine via catalytic hydrogenation. For 10 points, identify this functional group that consists of a nitrogen bound to two oxygen.

answer: {One}-{Dimensional Man}

This work's last words are a quotation from Walter Benjamin stating that "It is only for the sake of those without hope that hope is given to us," and the author's introduction to the first edition of this work explains that this work will vacillate between two contradictory positions. The philosophical behaviorism of Gilbert Ryle's The Concept of Mind and the banality of J.L. Austin's analysis in Other Minds come under attack in a section of this work concerning the "triumph of positive thinking." An analysis of "hyphenized abridgement" using examples like "brush-browed Teller," and "bull-shouldered... von Braun," is found in a section of this work concerned with the "Language of Total Administration" in the titular type of society. The author finds the rejection of the welfare state on abstract grounds of freedom "hardly convincing" in a section dedicated to the welfare and warfare states, while the last section of this work, entitled "The Chance of the Alternatives," explores the possibilities of the "Catastrophe of Liberation." Concluding with a call to a "Great Refusal," for ten points, identify this study in the "ideology of advanced industrial society," the most famous work of Herbert Marcuse.

answer: The {Hairy Ape}

In this play’s second scene, a fat old woman repeatedly screams the word “poser!” at a young woman who contemptuously calls herself “a waste product of the Bessemer process.” In its fifth scene, the protagonist’s violent outbursts fail to have any affect on a crowd of overdressed ladies and gentleman, who instead react ecstatically to the window display of a furrier. In its first scene, a chorus of men mockingly chant “drink, don’t think” to make fun of its main character, who is contrasted with the more philosophical Paddy and is jolted from his unthinking life when Mildred Douglas calls him a “filthy beast.” It first four scenes take place on a ship where the title character works as a stoker, and it ends with a scene in which its title character is crushed to death by a huge gorilla. For 10 points, name this expressionist 1922 play about the brutish laborer Yank, written by Eugene O’Neill.

In the sixth chapter of the first part of this work, it is asserted that "Individuals have no essences," since if man was a substance, it would inhere equally in Julius Caesar and John Thompson. Chapter 5 of its second part examines some opinions of Dr. Whewell, while Chapter 8 of part 3 examines four methods of experimental inquiry including those of agreement, difference, residues, and concomitant variations, and the following chapter contains examples of those methods, such as Liebig's theory of metallic poisons. The first chapter of this work explains why a theory of names is a necessary part of the titular concept, and its first part puts forth such a theory, as well as one of propositions, while this work's second part concludes with an examination of the doctrine of the Universal Postulate and William Hamilton's philosophy, and concerns itself with "reasoning." Also containing such illuminating sections as "Of Induction," "Of Fallacies," and "On the Logic of the Moral Sciences," for ten points, identify this exposition of reasoning, written by John Stuart Mill.
