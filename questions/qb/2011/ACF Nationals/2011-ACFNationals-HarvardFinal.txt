answer: {Babington} Plot

One participant in this event went by the aliases Colerdin and Pietro, and a poem called “Tichborn's Lamentation” was popularized after this event. One party in this event received a letter with a small picture of a gallows drawn on the seal. One overseer of this event was Charles Paget, and Bernardino de Mendoza met with one of the leaders of this event, who was exposed by the double agent Gilbert Gifford. This event began when John Ballard met with John Savage, and after one party in this event received a letter from Thomas Morgan, another letter was intercepted and deciphered by Phelippes, which allowed for close monitoring by Sir Francis Walsingham. Sharing the same goals as the earlier Ridolfi plot, for 10 points, identify this event, which led to the death of Mary, Queen of Scots, a plot against Elizabeth I of Britain.

answer: {Nephthys}

In the Lamentations partly named for this figure, she recites, "O good King, come to your house! Your two sisters beside you guard your bier." The name of this figure is translated as "Lady of the Mansion," and the Pyramid Texts describe her as an “imitation woman with no vagina.” This deity was often depicted watching Horus raise the djed pillar. She was responsible for guarding Hapi, one of the four sons of Horus, and through Osiris this goddess was the mother of a god whom she hid in the reeds out of fear of her husband; that son was Anubis. A daughter of Geb and Nut, this figure accompanied her sister in the search for and mourning of Osiris, and it is thought that she never had any children with her evil husband. For 10 points, name this funerary goddess of Egyptian myth, the consort of her brother Set.

Proximity to CTCF binding sites is thought to correlate with escape from this effect, as in the case of Jarid1C. In mammals, all variants of the modified histone macro-H2A participate in this process. Models to explain this process frequently invoke blocking factors, competence factors, and/or counting factors. In Drosophila, which lacks this phenomenon, the male-specific lethal gene product upregulates transcription of a certain subset of genes, while in mammals, this process requires the expression of a cis-acting namesake “specific transcript” which coats chromatin. This process begins at the two- or four-cell stage in mammals, and the randomness of this phenomenon is responsible for coat color in calico cats. For 10 points, name this dosage compensation effect in mammals that results in the formation of a Barr body.

answer: {spin} angular momentum [prompt on {angular momentum} ; do not accept or prompt on “ {momentum} ”]

This quantity is mapped to boson creation and annihilation operators by a transformation due to Holstein and Primakoff. Because the group of Lorentz transformations is non-compact, in one case, one introduces Dirac spinors to apply Lorentz transformations to this quantity. Waves of this quantity are described by dispersion relations of magnons and phonons and occur in ferromagnets. According to a result, which holds for all Lorentz invariant field theories on a positively normed Hilbert space, this quantity dictates whether the wave function is symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange. That statement is this quantity's “statistics theorem,” and its quantization was demonstrated by the Stern-Gerlach experiment. This degree of freedom permits two electrons to occupy each orbital and is either integer or half-integer for bosons and fermions. For 10 points, name this intrinsic form of angular momentum.

In Dreams of a Spirit Seer, Kant's critique of Swedenborg stops to satirically worry about the systematic extermination of these entities that occurs with his morning coffee. These entities are said to “have no windows through which something can enter or leave,” explaining why they can be entered by “neither substance nor accident.” The work that introduced these entities created a synchronous pre-established harmony between “the kingdom of final causes” and that of efficient causes. Their chief proponent gave them a three-part hierarchy, from spirits to souls to entelechies, and he described them as combining the merits of mathematical and physical points, being able to be both real and exact. For 10 points, give this term originating in ancient Greek philosophy referring merely to a “unit,” later essential to Leibniz's philosophy.

answer: {pathfinding} [accept equivalents like {shortest path} ]

One algorithm for this task is characterized by propagating waves of RAISE and LOWER states. In the absence of negative cycles, this task can be achieved by a cubic-order dynamic programming algorithm, which subdivides this task into intermediate vertices and computes a bottom-up metric from the connection matrix; that is the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. In the presence of negative edge weights, the algorithm used for accomplishing this task depends on the number of relaxation operations and has average complexity given by the product of the number of edges and vertices. In addition to the Bellman-Ford algorithm another method for approaching this task progressively closes the nearest node from an “open” set and adds its adjacent nodes, while computer games occasionally employ navigation meshes. For 10 points, name this process executed by algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's algorithm, which is also the subject of the traveling salesman problem.

Among the Babylonians, the god Nabu was considered crucial to the rituals associated with this event, which the Babylonians called Akitu. In many Japanese Buddhist sects, this event is accompanied by striking a gong 108 times to symbolize the 108 desires that keep people from salvation. According to Malinowski, among the Trobriand Islanders, this event is accompanied by the Milamala festival, while in pre-Islamic Iran, this event was celebrated at the festival of Nowruz, which today marks one of two such events for Muslims. In Hinduism, this event marks the return of Rama and its associated festival involves the lighting of oil lamps. During the Jewish celebration of this event, the tekiah, shevarim, and teruah are the three notes that sound during the blowing of the shofar.

The last two measures of this symphony’s third movement directly quote the end of the “Gloria” of Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis. Its first movement features a recurring motif that juxtaposes minor duplets with major triplets over the phrase “And, on its limitless heaving breast” which is played with a theme taken from the composer’s earlier tone poem The Solent. This work’s first movement opens with a brass fanfare in B minor on the word “Behold” which becomes a recurring motif. A baritone sings “Away, O Soul!” in its fourth movement, “The Explorers,” as the orchestra imitates the ship of the soul sailing away. Its second movement is based on the poem “On the Beach at Night, Alone” and a full chorus imitates “buoyant curves” in its third movement, “The Waves.” For 10 points, name this choral symphony based on poems from Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, the first composed by Ralph Vaughan-Williams.

This book argues that the three constitutive facts of Western consciousness are knowledge of death, knowledge of freedom, and knowledge of society and the discovery of society will either be the death or rebirth of freedom. It analyzes the phenomenon where all members of a hunting tribe bring the game they catch to one leader, which it calls the pattern of centricity. This book calls the practice of making items for one’s own use “house-holding,” which is grouped as one of three precursors to modern society along with systems based on redistribution and reciprocity. It asserts that society was forced to make a “protectionist countermove” after the disastrous attempts to maintain the international gold standard, which was previously one of the foundations for a self-regulating economy and the rise of a market society. For 10 points, name this book about the revolutionary change in England’s economy, written by Karl Polanyi.
