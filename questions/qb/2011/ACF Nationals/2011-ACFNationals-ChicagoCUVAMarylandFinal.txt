answer: Paul Johannes {Tillich}

One work by this thinker considers “broken” and “unbroken” myths while discussing the limits of the “conventional,” or rigid, form of the titular concept. This thinker noted that scriptural literalism requires as much conjecture as the work of David Strauss in his appeal to supplant the cultural identity of Christ in favor of a “New Being.” His best known work identifies meaninglessness as the culprit behind the present “age of anxiety” and closes by observing that the title concept is rooted “in the God who appears when God has disappeared.” This author of The Dynamics of Faith more centrally described a question-and-answer relationship to explain how divine revelation serves as an inextricable counterpart to ontology in his three-volume Systematic Theology. For 10 points, name this Christian theologian, a German-born lothario who mentored Rollo May and wrote The Courage to Be.

answer: {charge coupled device}

In the interline variety of these devices, readout occurs by shifting charge to a neighboring hidden column, while full-frame versions of these devices read out the entire data set at the same time, leading to longer readout times. Defects in these devices result in the spillover of charge into neighboring elements, a process known as “blooming,” and the optimal dynamic range of these devices is limited by the existence of dark current. The operating principle of these devices is that an incoming photon excites an electron out of a charge well, allowing that electron to be read out; accordingly, these devices are characterized by their well depth and their pixels can be damaged via ionizing radiation. They are generally preferable in scientific applications to CMOS sensors because of their excellent quantum efficiency. For ten points, identify these semiconductor devices which are used heavily used in astronomical imaging.

answer: {Henry VI}

One ruler of this name and number concluded the Treaty of Vercelli with the Lombard towns and struggled for control of Italian possession with Tancred of Lecce. That ruler of this name and number married Constance, the daughter of Roger II, which allowed this man to press his claim to the Sicilian throne. Another ruler of this name and number had a minority rule that never officially ended and was advised by Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and William de la Pole, the duke of Suffolk. That ruler lost the battle of Towton, leading to his imprisonment in the Tower of London. Briefly restored by Richard Neville, the Earl of Warwick, this husband of Margaret of Anjou was murdered in the Tower after Warwick’s forces were routed at Tewksbury by Edward IV, who succeeded this man. For ten points, identify this regnal name and number of the Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Emperor, a son of Barbarossa succeeded by Frederick II, and the Lancastrian English king during the first phase of the Wars of the Roses.

answer: {serine proteases} [prompt on partial answer]

Schechter and Berger mapped the active site of these enzymes, and MEROPS groups them into twelve clans and forty families. Hereditary angioneurotic edema is caused by a deficiency in one antagonist of these proteins, C1INH, and the nerve gas sarin binds to the active site of a closely related protein. Subtilisin is an example found in bacteria and makes up forty percent of commercial enzyme sales. One of these molecules is activated by IgM binding to a complex containing it and cleaves C4 and C2; that example is activated C1s. These proteins are important during blood clotting, where examples include factor X and thrombin, while examples in the digestive system includ trypsin and elastase. These proteins, which are inhibited by serpins, typically have a catalytic triad including aspartate, histidine, and their namesake. For 10 points, name this class of enzymes which cleave other proteins at their namesake residue.

answer: {isospin}

In a single J shell, for even values of the angular momentum this quantity is equal to one, while for odd angular momentum it is zero. For light nuclei and negligible Coulombic effects, the square of its quantum number approximately commutes with the Hamiltonian. One projection of this quantity is equal to the charge minus half the sum of strangeness and baryon number. Because strong interactions are invariant under rotations within the space defined by this property, it follows by Noether’s theorem in that it is conserved in strong interactions. Its symmetry, like the symmetry of a similar property, is approximated by the SU(2) group and that symmetry follows from up and down quarks having almost the same mass. For 10 points, name this quantum number introduced to explain the difference between a proton and a neutron.

answer: {russalka}

An analogous creature to these beings in another mythos was called the vele, and a story tells of how Prince Marko captured a leader of these beings named Nadanojla by having his falcon steal that leader’s headdress. These creatures were described as either ugly or beautiful depending on whether tales of them came from the north or the south, and they were sometimes subservient to a chief who took the form of a fat, jolly green man. According to one legend, these beings could survive outside their natural environment so long as they kept possession of a comb, and these beings were celebrated during the Radunitsa feast. One story about these beings tells of how a young seal hunter named Ivan Savelyevich encountered one while playing his balalaika and fell in love with her, but eventually left her by crossing himself. Most encounters with these beings would end poorly for the man, as they would typically end up making him dance to death or drowning him. For ten points, identify these analogues of the Ondine and the Lorelei, water sprites of Slavic myth.

answer: {The Family of Charles IV}

One woman in this painting stands in front of a darkened version of Furini’s Lot and his Daughters, a possible criticism of her morality. On the left, a young woman stands with her face to the wall next to an elderly woman with a large nose and wide eyes showing the effects of lupus. Since the subjects of this painting were all sketched separately before being painted together, they are all looking in different directions. Notoriously derided for depicting “the corner baker and his wife after they have won the lottery,” this painting portrays its title figure wearing a blue sash and numerous glittering medals. The artist stands in shadow in the back of this work, which depicts him using a mirror to paint Maria Luisa and Carlos Maria Isidro. For 10 points, name this Francisco Goya painting, commonly interpreted as a caricature of the title Spanish monarch and his relatives.

answer: {Suzuki}-{Miyaura coupling} [or {Suzuki}-{Miyaura} reaction; or {SM coupling}]

Baudoin developed an efficient one-pot way to generate ortho- substituted products based on this reaction, while Beller developed a technique using diadamantyl-n-butylphosphane ligands to carry out this reaction using in situ formed complex catalysts. A group including Kim, Lee, and Hyeon developed a version of this reaction that used hollow silica spheres to create spherical recyclable heterogeneous catalysts of a certain metal. This reaction is commonly used for macrocylicization in the synthesis of Rutamycin B. Sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate are commonly used in this reactionfor activation of one reagent for the transmetallation step. Nickel can be used as a catalyst for a version of this reaction for aryl chlorides. The mechanism of this reaction is somewhat similar to the Stille reaction, and it is an efficient way in a synthesis to create carbon-carbon bonds between two aryls. The traditional catalyst consists of four triphenylphosphines bound to a certain metal. For 10 points, name this palladium-catalyzed reaction that couples aryl boronic acids and aryl halides.

This leader had a major diplomatic standoff with France after his nephews stole a yacht belonging to Bruno Roger, painted it yellow, and tried to auction it back to French officials. He received a de-facto exile as Polish Ambassador after the Gafsa Incident, a comically failed coup that saw angry lunatics drive through the streets shooting people and demanding they blame the government. Bettino Craxi supposedly instructed Italy's SISMI to secretly facilitate this leader's rise to power in order to prevent Chadli Benjadid from invading. The opposition of al-Nabhani's Hizb ut-Tahrir, or Liberation Party, led this man to reshape the Neo-Destour Party into the Constitutional Democratic Rally after declaring his predecessor, Habib Bourguiba, medically unfit for office. After this man's agents confiscated some fruits and vegetables from a 26 year-old grad student, the student lit himself on fire, sparking protests against this man that led Mohamed Ghannouchi to take over in the Jasmine Revolution. For 10 points, name this recently-deposed former dictator of Tunisia.

One commander in this conflict dropped crash dummies with parachutes as part of Operation Magistral, which led to a heroic stand on Hill 3234. Tensions leading up to it were exacerbated by an incident in which Adolph Dubs was killed after a hostage standoff in a hotel by members of Setami Milli. This conflict saw the nefarious KHAD carry out a series of massacres at the Pul-e-Charkhi prison, and was partially triggered by the growing popularity of the Khalq Party. This effort was driven by hardware like the BMP-1, in which it exposed a serious chassis design flaw, and SU-25 Frogfoots based out of Bagram Air Base. It opened with with Storm-333, a furious assault by Alpha Group on the Tajbeg Palace that killed President Amin. Occuring in the wake of the Saur Revolution, it turned on the participation of men like Michael Vickers in Operation Cyclone, which supplied Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen. For 10 points, identify this 1979-1989 conflict that saw a communist power occupy Kabul.
