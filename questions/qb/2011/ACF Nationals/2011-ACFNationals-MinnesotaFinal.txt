answer: {holographic principle}

One implication of this statement is that the Bekenstein bound on the maximum entropy contained in a given volume holds; that implication suggests that for every 4 Planck area, there is at most one degree of freedom. This statement was proposed due to the observation that gravity in a type of anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to gravity in a type of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory that is defined in the boundary of the anti-de Sitter space; that equivalence is called the adS/CFT correspondence. This statement was developed from Gerard t’Hooft’s work on black hole evaporation in a paper by Leonard Susskind, which uses the example of a black holes horizon mapped onto a screen to demonstrate this statement. For 10 points, identify this statement, which, if true, would hold that any information in a given volume can be completely encoded on that volume’s surface.

While serving in his highest office, this man ordered the song “March of the Volunteers” changed to be less militaristic in order to honor his predecessor. He became unpopular after issuing a statement pledging unwavering support for his predecessor’s policies in an article called “Study the Documents Well and Grasp the Key Link,” which was mockingly summarized as the “Two Whatevers” statement. This man became the minister of public security after helping to engineer the downfall of Lin Biao, and during his premiership, mass displays of mourning for his predecessor at the Monument to the People’s Heroes resulted in the house arrest of his vice-premier. His most notable act as premier was ordering the arrest of Jiang Qing, thus ending the power of the Gang of Four.

One early member of this faith founded what would become Cheshnut College for Ministers after six students of this faith were expelled from St. Edmund Hall. That woman, Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, was instrumental to founding one offshoot of this faith, whose members congregate in societies called “connections.” The creation of this religious denomination was inspired by Clement of Alexandria’s description of a perfect Christian, and the preaching of this denomination was based on its founder’s Sermons and Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament. This denomination was first established in the United States at the Christmas Conference led by two men appointed co-superintendents by this faith’s primary founder, Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke and adheres to its founder’s namesake “quadrilateral” of scripture, tradition, reason, and experience. For 10 points, name this Protestant Christian denomination primarily based on the teachings of John Wesley.

Korean has a three-way distinction of this feature, as illustrated by the minimal triplet of words meaning “moon,” “daughter,” and “mask.” Chin-Wu Kim was the first to suggest that the length of this feature is correlated with the width of the glottis opening. A version of it, which accompanies the closure of a consonant occurs in North Germanic languages such as Icelandic. In Ancient Greek and Sanskrit, this feature is lost in its first occurrence in words, which have two consonants with this feature in adjacent syllables, a process known as Grassmann’s law. In English, voiceless stops have this feature at the beginning of stressed syllables, but typically not after [s]. It is indicated by a positive voice onset time, and in the IPA, it is represented by a superscript h.

The Hotelling transform is a development of a technique devised by this man which, for multivariate data, gives a set of “principal component” variables which are uncorrelated to each other, which is equivalent to applying the Single Variable Decomposition on a covariance matrix. This mathematician showed that the distribution of the t-test statistic approaches the chi-squared distribution as the number of sampled random variables approaches infinity, and a lemma which gives the criterion for selecting the uniformly most powerful hypothesis test is named for Jerzy Neyman and this mathematician’s son Egon. This man is credited with the introduction of a quantity whose square is the coefficient of determination, and which is equal to the covariance of X and Y divided by the product of the standard deviations of X and Y.

This deity was worshipped by the Persians until the rise of Zoroastrianism led to his role being usurped by the yazata Atar. The sage Vasistha condemned this deity’s three sons to be born and reborn repeatedly; those three sons are Pavaka, Pavamana, and Suchi. This god revealed the identity of Puloma to a demon, causing the sage Bhrigu to lay a curse on him. He helped convey the sparks of Shiva’s seed to the Ganges River, where they eventually became Kartikeya, as a result of which some myths call Kartikeya the son of this deity and his consort Svaha. Eight of the ten books of the Rig Veda open with hymns to this messenger god, a son of Prthivi and Dyaus Pita. Usually depicted with three legs and seven arms, he serves as the lokapala of the southeast and uses his seven tongues to lick up sacrificial butter. For 10 points, identify this brother of Surya and Indra, the Vedic god of fire.

In a review titled “Rewriting vs. Translation,” Robert Bly ridicules Ben Belitt’s rendering of this poem in “Lowellese,” especially the phrase “whooping it up until I died of the shivers.” This poem’s narrator speaks of Monday seeing him “with my convict face,” and “blaz[ing] up like gasoline,” and sees “sulphur colored birds and hideous intestines hanging over the doors of the houses I hate.” This poem’s speaker does not want to “be the inheritor of so many misfortunes” or to “continue as a root and as a tomb... half frozen, dying of grief.” This poem ends with the image of laundry on the line weeping “slow dirty tears,” and begins with the speaker feeling that tailors’ shops and movies are “all shriveled up,” causing the speaker to feel like a swan “sailing on water of origin and ash.” Its speaker imagines killing a nun with a stone after stating “It happens that I am sick of being a man.” For 10 points, name this poem from Residence on Earth, a work in which Pablo Neruda riffs on his parambulations.

This artist of Fidelia and Speranza painted a green, huge-eared batlike dragon and a red-skinned turbaned man with ridiculous facial hair among a train of figures following the title figure of another of his paintings. A snake coils itself around one arm of that figure, whose fists both emit rays of light and whose white horse tramples a crowd of humans.

The final movement of the third of these pieces uses rapidly alternating notes in the piano to imitate a woodpecker. The seventh of these pieces combines a gigue with a popular quadrille in its second movement, and represents a singing contest in its third movement toccata. The sixth of them is scored for flute and bassoon, and begins with a movement in the style of their composer's earlier chôros [show-roos]. The first one is unusually scored for eight cellos, which also accompany a soprano singing a wordless Aria in the first movement of the fifth one. The second of them ends with a movement evoking the creaking and puffing of a country train, and is titled "The Little Train of the Caipira." They were composed from 1930 to 1945, and combine folk songs with forms from Baroque music.

A reaction named for Bamberger acylates these compounds via a ring-opening step. The earliest synthesis of these compounds involved a condensation of an aldehyde with an alpha-dicarbonyl compound such as glyoxal using 2 equivalents of ammonia in the presence of alcohol; that reaction is named for Radziszewski and Debus. This functional group is most commonly found in drugs such as proton pump inhibitors. It has a pKa of 7, and its nucleophilic character makes it an ideal base for ester hydrolysis. It is much more basic than related compounds such as pyrrole because the sp2 electrons on one of the nitrogens are not delocalized into the pi-system. For 10 points, identify this heterocyclic functional group whose structure is a cyclopentadiene with two nitrogens, the functional group that forms the side chain of histidine.

answer: {Voting Rights} Act of 1965

One year after its passage, this legislation withstood a direct constitutional challenge in the Katzenbach case. Among the provisions of this legislation was a triggering clause that required federal pre-clearance of procedural changes. This legislation’s second section was amended in 1982 for the purposed of overturning the ruling of the Supreme Court in City of Mobile v. Bolden and employed a “totality of circumstances” approach, while its fourth section was likewise amended in the same year to allow jurisdictions to opt out of coverage if they had been in compliance for the past decade. Pursuant to Section 5 of this legislation, the Justice Department would obtain the right to prosecute such practices as “single-shot,” as a result of the 1969 Allen v.
