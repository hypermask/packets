answer: {dyneins}

Like the ribosome biogenesis protein midasin, this protein contains on a single polypeptide six versions of the AAA ATPase domain. A 6-Angstrom resolution crystal structure of a portion of this protein by Carter et al. suggests a model for propagation of a conformational change of a linker region and down a coiled-coil “buttress” and a 15-nanometer-long stalk.This protein interacts with nuclear distribution protein E, and interacts through a complex containing p150Glued and Arp1with beta-III spectrin. One form of this protein is found in 96-nanometer repeats containing outer-arm and inner-arm versions of this protein along a structure that adopts a 9+2 arrangement of microtubules. For 10 points, name this motor protein that comes in cytoplasmic, intraflagellar transport, and axonemal varieties, and which moves toward the minus end of microtubules, unlike kinesins.

One character in this work praises “only ideograms in algebraic quantums,” while another character declares that he loves “to have [his] hairs / Ruffled well below the navel.” The Right and Left Ears of State are the intelligence service for the Organizing Secretary of this work’s title character. This work opens with a “Hemlock” section, features a national anthem that is sardonically revised to begin “Ism to ism for ism is ism,” and closes with a “Hangover.” The title character in this work is opposed by Daodu, who is the nephew of a chieftain and runs a farm commune. This play concludes with the title character gaping in terror at the decapitated head of Segi’s father during the Festival of the New Yam. For 10 points, name this play in which the title dictator of the land of Isma opposes the traditional chief Oba Danlola, a work of Wole Soyinka.

answer: {Wends} (accept word forms; accept {West Slavs} before “{Slavs}” are mentioned and “{Lutici}” before that name is {given}; prompt on “{Slavs}” before they are mentioned)

A nominally Christian faction of these people historically allied with the Holy Roman Empire in its conflict with the Danes. Following Otto II’s defeat at the Battle of Stilo in Calabria, the Obotrites under Mstivoj launched a 986 uprising against the Empire aimed at overthrowing the imperial ‘marks’ in the territory of these people, who are also called the Lutici. That uprising successfully delayed Christianization, a process that was essentially complete in 1168 when Valdemar the Great of Denmark sacked Arkona on Rugen and tore down the shrine of Svantevit, the chief diety of the subset of these people known as the Rani. Earlier, an 1147 crusade led against these people by Henry the Lion devastated Pomerania and seized Lubeck, a major trading center and the former Obotrite capital. For 10 points, name these people with a major center at Rethra who lived east of the Saxon Line in contemporary north-east Germany, the western branch of the Slavs.

answer: {Khorasan}

The Ghaznavid dynasty, founded by Turkic military chieftains, ruled this region after they overthrew their prior patrons, the Persian Samavids, who had appointed Sebuktigin governor of Ghazna and thus ruler of this region. The battle of Dandanqan in 1040 was the decisive Ghaznavid defeat, thus rendering this region subject to the Seljuk Turks. Earlier, Abu Muslim, a dynast who ruled from Merv in this region, was a major force in the coalition that established the Abbasid Caliphate, but the second ruler of that family, Abu Jafar Al-Mansur, betrayed Abu Muslim and so established direct control over this region. This region’s golden age came under the Timurids, who ruled from Herat until being overrun by Uzbek clans, which in turn lost this region to the founding Safavid Ismail Shah. For 10 points, name this region of contemporary northeastern Iran, western Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan, a late Zoroastrian stronghold and artistic and trading center in the 15th century.

By using a mathematical model in which valuation varied with quality, Novos and Waldman concluded that this concept did not lead to increased social loss from underutilization, while Takeyama showed that under certain conditions the absence of this concept could produce Pareto optimal results via network effects. David Levine and Michelle Boldrin have argued against this concept in a book which claims that this concept does not produce the increasing returns claimed by its advocates. The decision in Feist v. Rural established that “sweat of the brow,” was not sufficient for this status, holding that this status requires originality. Baker v. Selden held that this status was not applicable to an idea but only to the expression of an idea itself, while Gyles v. Wilcox established an abridgement of this status called “fair use.” Regulated on an international scale by the 1988 Berne Convention, for ten points, identify this legal concept outlined in Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution which grants exclusive rights to authors over their works.

In one work, this man uses tailor swatches to explain his idea of “exemplification,” in which objects both represents a predicate and also possess it. That same work claims that paintings are “syntactically unlimited and semantically dense” because of the multiplicity of meaning in both the marks on the paper and what they could possibly refer to. This philosopher renounced the concept of abstract entities with Quine in “Steps Toward a Constructive Nominalism” and formulated a “calculus of simplicity” in his essay “On the Theory of Systems,” the first chapter of his The Structure of Appearance. Another of his works opens an essay on “The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals,” and develops the theory of projection. In that work, he argued that the choice of predicate bases could not be explained by Hume’s method of basing induction in repetition, and that coming up with rules equivalent to laws of deductive logic for induction was the “new riddle of induction.” For 10 points, name this author of Language of Art and Fact, Fiction and Forecast who formulated the grue-bleen paradox.

answer: {baptism}

This practice had an analog in the cult of Cybele’s practice of taurobolium, and this practice is advocated by the Right Ginza in Mandeism, which follows this action with a sacred meal. A reference to this practice “for the dead,” is contained in 1 Corinthians 15:29, in which it is asked “if there is no resurrection, what will those do,” to whom this has happened. That practice may originate in the rituals of the Orphic cult, which carried out this action to prepare their dead for the underworld. According to the Arians and the Donatists, this action was only efficacious if performed by someone who was of pure intention and belonged to the church, while leaders like Conrad Grebel and Felix Mantz argued that only an adult could undergo this ritual and denied its usefulness to infants. This practice is generally considered the first sacrament in Catholicism. Taking its name from the Greek for “to immerse,” for ten points, identify this action which was performed for Jesus by John, and which involves annointment with water, symbolizing entry to the faith.

answer: {Boltzmann} transport equation

A common use of this equation is to derive the equation of change for mean values. Near equilibrium, the quantity of interest in this equation may be parametrized as deviating from the equilibrium state by a parameter phi. In that case, this equation reduces to an integral equation whose right hand side is an integral over volume and solid angle of the product of the change in phi, the equilibrium distribution, the perturbed distribution, and the velocity. One simplifying approximation useful in solving this equation is to assume that collisions serve to restore equilibrium; then one side of this equation can be written as the difference between the original and current distribution functions. In its most compact form, this equation sets the total derivative of a distribution equal to a collisional term, and if that collisional term is zero, this equation reduces to the Vlasov equation. For ten points, identify this equation which forms the basis of the theory of transport processes.

One man from this country wrote an essay arguing that writers like Leon Bloy and Lord Dunsany are seen as connected only because they both influenced the essay’s title author, and that “every writer creates his own precursors.” That essay in “Kafka and his Precursors.” Another writer from this country praised tristes and vidalitas, peasant songs from this country, but criticized the culture they came from, represented by the title figure, for retarding this country’s progress. That work is Facundo. A critic of that work and its author Sarmiento wrote a poem whose title character leaves his post as a frontier soldier after trouble with the law and joins Sergeant Cruz to pursue the gaucho way of life; that work is Martin Fierro. For 10 points, name this home of Jose Hernandez and Jorge Luis Borges.

answer: Cauchy {completeness} [accept just “ {Cauchy} ” before mentioned]

For a space with this property, the intersection of a countable number of open dense sets is also dense, as shown in the Baire category theorem. All closed and bounded sets are compact only if the space holds this property, and spaces with this property are compact if and only if they are also totally bounded. Hilbert space is the extension of an inner product space to make it have this property. In general a field without this property can be extended into with it by finding the set of equivalence classes of all the Cauchy sequences, as seen by the construction of the reals from the rationals. For 10 points, name this property of a metric space in which every Cauchy sequence converges to a point in the space.

answer: {Christmas} or {Natal}

One geographical feature with this name was given it by Captain Cook, when he landed in that bay at the extreme northeast of the Loranchet Peninsula on Kerguelen or Desolation Island in the southern Indian Ocean on the same day that Washington crossed the Delaware. An island with this name southwest of Java was transferred from Singapore to Australia in 1957. That island was named in 1643 by the captain of a passing Indiaman. A different island with this name is also called Kiritimati, which is actually pronounced identically to this in the native Gilbertese. That island was used to test hydrogen bombs in the 1950s. This name also applies to the South African region containing Pietermaritzburg and Durban. In that case, the name was bestowed by Vasco de Gama in 1497, and the region was its own province through most of the 20th century but was enlarged to include the Bantustan of Kwa-Zulu in 1994. For 10 points, give this name which generally signifies that a geographical feature was discovered on the anniversary of Jesus’ birth.
