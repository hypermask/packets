answer: {covering} the {head} [accept {logical} equivalents]

In Zoroastrianism, this action is usually accomplished with a "topi" and must be done before entering a fire temple. This is not a requirement for Druze but can be accomplished with a "doppa." For Sikhs this practice is first undertaken in a ceremony called the "dastar bandi" and is more important for men than women because of differences in the location of the "solar center." Female Jehovah's Witnesses only need to adopt this practice when leading services. Paul spends the bulk of chapter 11 of First Corinthians discussing the requirement for this. In Roman Catholicism, it is traditional for clerics to accomplish this using a "zucchetto." In Islam, this practice is never explicitly mandated in the Qu'ran, but the four major schools of jurisprudence believe it should be accomplished with a hijab. For 10 points, name this practice which devout Jews may observe with a kippah or yarmulke.

answer: Cassius

This character tells another that it "is very much lamented" that "you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye." In another scene he wonders "how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over, in states unborn and accents yet unknown." On the day of his death, this character interprets the disappearance of two eagles that fed from soldiers' hands as a bad omen and informs Messala that it is his birthday. Casca informs this character that an overheard conversation "was Greek to me." He tells another character that the fault "is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings," and is described by the title character of the play in which he appears as having a "lean and hungry look." For 10 points, name this conniving senator who convinces Brutus to help him assassinate Julius Caesar in a Shakespeare play.

answer: Germaine {Greer}

This author selected the work of various seventeenth century female poets for her anthology Kissing the Rod. This thinker argued that the title historical figure of another work partook in a type of union called "handfasting" and commends her for marrying her daughter Susanna to the doctor John Hall. That work by this author argues against the notion that Ann Hathaway’s pregnancy trapped her husband into marriage and downplays her inheritance of the "second best bed." This author of Shakespeare's Wife included a chapter on "Pantomime Dames" and drew flack for an occasionally positive portrayal of female genital mutilation in her 1999 book the whole woman, an update of her 1970 book which argued that the traditional nuclear family divorces women from their sexuality. For 10 points, name this Australian feminist, the author of The Female Eunuch.

answer: {Duke} of {Guise}

The final man to hold this position was nearly executed after joining the count de Soissons at the Battle of La Marfee. That holder of this position profited from Masaniello's rebellion by leading the short lived Neapolitan Republic in 1647. This position was created to reward a soldier who had suffered twenty-two wounds at the battle of Marignano, and each person who occupied it hailed from Lorraine. The second holder of this position fought bitterly with the Montmorency over the position of chief advisor to Francis II and Charles IX, and like his son was nicknamed Le Balafré or "the Scarred" for his military exploits. That son, the third holder of this position, was supported by the Day of the Barricades and set off the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre by assassinating Admiral Coligny. For 10 points, name this position held by the Catholic rival of Henry III and Henry of Navarre in the War of the Three Henries.

This author noted "A poet is born within the cracks of crime" in his poem "A Poet's Heart." Almost all of the English translations of his works are completed by Brother Anthony of Taize. He wrote a fictionalization of the Flower Garland Sutra in which the title boy seeks knowledge from fifty three different masters to become a Bodhisattva. This author's most famous poem suggests "throwing away like rags all we've had for decades" and notes that "in dark daylight the target is rushing towards us." This author read that poem, "Arrows," at a series of protests in the seventies until he was arrested in 1980. While imprisoned, this former monk and author of the novel Little Pilgrim decided to write a poem about every person he had ever met. For 10 points, name this author of Ten Thousand Lives, a Korean poet perpetually on the Nobel Prize short list.

answer: {integration} with respect to {time} [accept logical equivalents which mention {integration} and {time}]

In the “interaction picture” of quantum mechanics, the propagator can be obtained by repeatedly performing this operation on successive terms of the Dyson series. With no forcing function and constant fluid density, performing this operation is equivalent to performing the surface integral of the velocity divergence, and performing this operation on the Poisson bracket of the phase-space density with the Hamiltonian yields the phase space density by Liouville’s theorem. In the absence of external sources, performing this operation on the curl of the electric field will give the magnetic field, up to multiplicative and additive constants. Multiplying the Stefan-Boltzmann equation by the area and performing this operation on the result gives the total radiated energy. Performing this operation on the action yields the Lagrangian, and performing this operation on the dot product of force and velocity gives the total power. For ten points, identify this operation which, when performed twice on the acceleration with initial conditions specified yields the total displacement.

In 1940 Fletcher Dobyns published an "Expose of the Power of Propaganda" alleging that this cause was not supported popularly but by a greedy group of elites. A group called "The Crusaders" published a newsletter called "The Hot Potato" that advocated this cause. This goal was partially realized with the passage of the Cullen-Harrison Act. A widely circulating poster advocating this movement read "their security demands you vote" and was created by the WONPR and its leader Pauline Sabin. Other organizations created to enact this cause included the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers, the Molly Pitcher Club, and the AAPA. The last state to enact this was Mississippi in 1966, as the second section of the legislation which achieved this cause nationally gave states the power to choose. Supporters of this movement pointed to the St. Valentine's Day massacre and other increases in criminal behavior. For 10 points, name this cause that was accomplished with the 21st amendment.

answer: Manchester

The Woolf Report suggested prison reforms after this city's Strangeways Prison endured a 25 day prison riot. William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien were nicknamed this city's "martyrs" after being executed for killing a police officer here. In 1817, this city was marched on by a group of weavers calling themselves the Blanketeers. When this city's growth was checked in the 18th century, Francis Egerton completed the Bridgewater Canal to connect it to the Worsley coal mines. This city became known as Cottonopolis because of its textile growth during the Industrial Revolution, and its working class was examined in a Frederich Engels text. One event near this city, built on the site of the Roman settlement of Macunium, was prompted by the speech of Henry Hunt and prompted the passage of the Six Acts. For 10 points, name this site of the Peterloo Massacre and second largest city in England.

answer: compressibility

One variable named for this property appears in the numerator of an integral added to the natural logarithm of pressure to yield the natural logarithm of fugacity, and an equation named for this property relates the two-body direct correlation function to temperature. Using Kay’s rule, the computation of pressure times observed molar volume over the product of the gas constant and temperature yields this property's namesake factor, and at Mach numbers below 0.3, the effects named for this property are considered to be negligible. The coefficient of this property is equal to negative one over volume times the partial derivative of volume with respect to pressure. For 10 points, name this property referring to the changes in volume of a substance in response to changes in pressure.

This ideological position was lampooned by a commentator who wrote "a vulture is almost an eagle" and is often believed to be the reason for a reference to a Brothers Grimm tale during a rant against Beckmesser in one work by the holder of this orientation. The subject of the book The Darker Side of Genius is this attitude, which reached its zenith in an article that denounced the "cold indifference" of a "peculiar blubber" and the "evil conscience of our modern civilization." That article, demonstrating this ideological orientation, compared certain people to worms on the body of art, demanded that those people "go under like Ahauseurus," and was signed with the pseudonym "K. Freigedank." For 10 points, identify this bias of a particular composer, which manifested in the 1850 New Journal of Music article about a certain characteristic "in music," and leads to controversy whenever the overture from Tristan und Isolde is performed in Israel.

One of this author’s short stories ends with its protagonist seeing a vision of souls ascending to heaven on a purple streak of light after shouting “Who do you think you are?” at God while hosing down some hogs. That story by this author begins in a doctor’s waiting room, where an acne-ridden Wellesley student throws her book Human Development at the protagonist and tells her “Go back to hell where you came from, you old wart hog.” In addition to writing that story about Ruby Turpin’s title epiphany, this author wrote a story in which a middle-aged white woman attempts to give a black child a penny, only for that child’s mother to knock her to the ground with her pocketbook. That story takes place on a bus, and ends with Julian’s mother crumpling to the ground. For 10 points, name this American author of short stories such as “Revelation” and “Everything That Rises Must Converge.”

Coleridge's Biographia Literaria most prominently plagiarizes the work of this philosopher, who resigned from the University of Berlin after losing a law suit against a man who had stolen his lectures and published them before he could present them. He wrote of God who gains freedom by becoming conscious through reflecting on ideas in himself in his book The Ages of the World. Though he edited the "Critical Journal of Philosophy" and was the college roommate of Hegel, The Phenomenology of Mind strongly condemned this man's conception of the Absolute. In his most famous work, this philosopher advanced the work of his former teacher Hegel by uniting it with the act of artistic creation as a way of advancing from chaos and inertia into order. For 10 points, name this German philosopher and author of System of Transcendental Idealism.

In Hittite mythology, Teshub uses one of these implements to separate the diorite monster Ullikummi from the giant Upelluri; that device of this type had earlier been used to separate the earth from the heavens. In Japanese myth, a trio of weasels named for this implement knock down, slice, and heal wayfarers. This namesake of the Kamaitachi is often depicted as wielded by the Basque goddess Mari and Ereshkegal's consort Nergal. Midas' son Lityerses killed people with these implements after challenging them to a contest involving them. In addition to winged sandals, Hermes gives Perseus one of these. Typhon steals one of these from Zeus and cuts his tendons off with it. A third instance of an adamant one of these in Greek mythology indirectly causes the birth of Aphrodite. For 10 points, name this tool used by Kronos to castrate Uranus, an implement sometimes wielded by Demeter for its use in harvesting wheat.

Francis Poulenc composed the "Deploration" final movement of his sonata for this instrument just before his death. This instrument plays a solo at the beginning of the second movement of Respighi’s Gli Uccelli, “The Dove.” Alessandro Marcello composed a concerto for this instrument and Strings in D minor which J.S. Bach transcribed for harpsichord. This instrument plays the opening melody of the “Prelude” from Ravel’s orchestration of Le Tombeau de Couperin, as well as the only solo in the adagio movement of Brahms' Violin Concerto. Before concerts, modern orchestras commonly tune their instruments to match the note A played by this instrument. Marcel Tabuteau pioneered the Philadelphia style of playing this instrument, whose family includes the English horn. For 10 points, name this double reed woodwind which represents the duck in Peter and the Wolf.

When the entities that compose these objects enter their planet's shadow, photoelectric processes shut down and those entities become more negatively charged. That results in a coupled oscillation between those entities orbital eccentricity and their semimajor axis, which is known as shadow resonance and explains the Thebe extension to one of these objects. A significant decrease in the brightness of one of these objects is known as the Metis notch. These objects include the toroidal halo interior of the main one and the two gossamer ones. They straddle the orbits of Amalthea and the other three inner moons of the planet that was hit by the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet. For 10 points, name these features of the largest planet in our solar system, discovered by Voyager I and studied extensively by the Galileo mission.

One of these events is traditionally said to have occurred the same year as the dedication of the temple of Ceres, leading to speculation that it was sparked by the Cult of Ceres. Another of these events resulted in the creation of the "intercesso" and a famine which forced importation of grain from Sicily. One of these events caused the creation of the "comita tribute" and ensured that its rulings were of equal stature as those of the centuriate assembly. The final known one of these occurred on the Janiculan hill and resulted in the appointment of Quintus Hortensius as emperor and the passage of the Lex Hortensia. After the second of these events occurred at the Aventine Hill, a decimvir was appointed to design the Code of the Twelve Tables. The first event of this type took place on the Mons Sacer, prompted the construction of the Temple of Concord, and resulted in a general forgiveness of debts and the creation of the Tribune position. For 10 points, name this strategy in the Conflict of the Orders in which the lowest Roman class would simply leave the city.

One result of this event was "Operation mafuta mingi" or "Get Rich Quick," in which stores that had sold out their wares were encouraged to restock. This event was accompanied with the firing of twenty-nine chief police officers, the creation of nine new provinces, and the injuring of U.S. diplomat Pierre Shostal. This event was an extension of the sentiment expressed in Augustine Kamya's 1959 boycott. The perpetrator of this action gave a speech to the Airborne Regiment in the town of Tororo announcing that God came to him in a dream and asked that it be done. This event caused shouts of "Two, four, six, eight, we don't want to integrate!" during protests against Edward Heath's government in England. One reason given for this action was that balance books were written in Hindi or Gujarati to intentionally confuse tax collectors, and Julius Nyerere planned a September 17th invasion to coincide with the chaos caused by this event. For 10 points, name this action in which Idi Amin forced people of Chinese and Indian descent from his country.

This structure’s evolutionary origins may lie in the relatively recent horizontal gene transfer of a pair of retroviral env proteins, known as syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 in humans. The Tenney-Parker change is a pathological finding in this structure of unusually high numbers of syncytial knots. Taxa are classified as eutherian based on whether or not they possess, or are extinct ancestors of species that possess this structure. Hofbauer cells are a type of macrophage that participates in vertical transmission in it. In this structure, the septa formed by incursions of the decidua basalis approach, but do not fully connect to, the chorionic plate. Inadequate perfusion of this organ is thought to be a cause of pre-eclampsia, a condition that can only be cured by removing this villous organ. For 10 points, name this organ which secretes human chorionic gonadotropin and is derived from maternal and fetal tissue.
