answer: " {Locksley Hall} "

The speaker of this poem bitterly declares that a former lover's husband merely thinks of her as "Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse." Its speaker fantasizes about voyaging to "Summer isles of Eden" in "dark-purple spheres of sea" where he might "take some savage woman" and rear a "dusky race," but dismissively concludes "better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay." In the second half of this poem, the speaker sees "the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be" when "the war-drum throbb'd no longer," giving way to "the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world." The first half of this poem focuses on the speaker's love for his cousin Amy, causing him to reflect that "In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love." For 10 points, name this dramatic monologue about a soldier's return to his title childhood home, written by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

answer: {Chandigarh}

The first major sociological study of this city was a 1968 work by Victor D’Souza. This city is situated on an alluvial plain at the base of the Siwalik range, a fact which explains its great agricultural productivity as a result of the Green Revolution. This city takes its name from the nearby temple dedicated to the goddess Mani Majra, and its attractions include a rock garden featuring sculptures by the artist Nek Chand. Bounded to the north by the artificial Lake Sukhna, this city comprises 50 mostly square sectors. This city’s plan was laid out with the help of Maxwell Fry, Jane Drew, and Pierre Jeanerret, and its architecture made use of a “parasol,” motif which the main architect had borrowed from Fatehpur Sikri and employed in the buildings of this city’s Assembly, High Court, and Secretariat. For 10 points, identify this Indian city planned by Le Corbusier, the capital of Punjab.

answer: Caesar {Domitianus Augustus} or Titus Flavius {Domitianus}

According to one source, this ruler executed Sallustius Lucullus for inventing a new type of spear and then naming it after himself. Fearing rebellion, this ruler forbade two legions from sharing the same camp, and he gained favor with the army by increasing its pay by one-third from the previous Caesarian-Augustan rate. The first emperor since Claudius to campaign in person, this emperor took for himself the title of “Germanicus” after defeating the Chatti and was largely responsible for the construction of the Rhine-Danube fortifications. Unpopular with the aristocracy for such extravagances as demanding to be called dominus et deus, this emperor commanded the executions of his relatives Flavius Sabinus and Flavius Clemens and was opposed in the Senate by a coalition headed by the son of a man executed by Vespasian, Helvidius Priscus. This emperor also put down the 89 C.E. revolt of Satruninus. Succeeded upon his assassination by Nerva, for 10 points, identify this Roman emperor, the successor to his brother Titus.

answer: {Irgun} Zvai Leumi [accept {Etzel} , do not accept “the {Stern Gang} ”]

Tensions between this organization and its rival flared in an incident during which this group’s supply ship, the Altalena, was sunk. Following the issuing of the Passfield White Paper, this group helped organize immigration, and its military operations included the capture of Jaffa as well as the freeing of over 200 prisoners held at Acre. Along with an organization called “Lehi,” this group was an offshoot of the Hagana and its political wing would later become the Herut, or “Freedom,” party. This organization’s most famous actions included the killing of all 254 inhabitants of the village of Deir Yassin, as well as the July 22, 1946 killing of 91 people via a bomb. Disbanded by order of David Ben Gurion after its members’ incorporation into the IDF, for 10 points, identify this Menachem Begin-led paramilitary force of Jewish settlers, whose notable acts of terrorism included the bombing of the King David Hotel.

answer: Vicente {Aleixandre}

This writer is the subject of several critical works by Carlos Bousono, who wrote the first major study of this writer’s work. This poet wrote of “hatred-sized tigers,” and “beats of a heart ignorant of almost everything but love,” in his poem “Jungle and Sea,” and developed a style he called “consciousness without limitation,” in a volume containing such poems as “Death or the Waiting Room,” and “Flying Fugue on a Horse.” This author of the collection Swords Like Lips described a title figure as having “his ears singed by the terrifying words,” in the poem “The Old Man is Like Moses,” contained in his Dialogues of Knowledge, and his early collection Ambito was strongly influenced by surrealism. This poet recalled his native city of Malaga in his collection Shadows of Paradise, while many reflections on the Spanish Civil War are contained his volumes Final Birth and In a Vast Domain. For 10 points, identify this member of the Generation of ‘27, whose Surrealist-influenced poetry can be found in works such as Destruction or Love and History of the Heart, the winner of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Literature.

answer: {two}-{factor} theory of emotion [or the {Schachter}-{Singer} theory of emotion before either name is mentioned; prompt on {just Schachter} or {Singer} before mentioned]

In 1979, Marshall and Zimbardo replicated the experiment that provided the first evidence for this theory, but were unable to reproduce its results. This theory was supported by a 1974 experiment conducted by Dutton and Aron, which found that male subjects were more likely to call the woman interviewing them if the interview took place on a shaky suspension bridge. It was first tested in a 1962 experiment whose subjects were told they were being injected with the vitamin Suproxin, but were actually injected with adrenaline. A confederate then deliberately irritated the participants of that experiment, causing the subjects injected with adrenaline to become extremely angry, a result that supported this theory. It challenged the prevailing Cannon-Bard theory of the same phenomena, arguing that those phenomena arise from both physiological arousal and the mental label of that arousal. For 10 points, name this theory of emotion developed by Jerome Singer and Stanley Schachter.

answer: {period-luminosity} relation

When the logarithm of one of the variables in this equation drops below about 0.4, this equation changes slope, which limits its usefulness for shorter timescales. The Key project on the Hubble Space Telescope measured the Hubble constant by exploiting this formula, and a major problem with using this formula is finding a reliable zero-point. This formula is slightly sensitive to metallicity, and before it can be used it must be adjusted for reddening. Once color is known, the fact that one of the observed variables in this equation does not depend on distance allows the determination of a distance scale by regarding objects that obey this equation as standard candles. Originally discovered as an empirical rule by Henrietta Levitt, for 10 points, identify this relationship between the size and light output of a pulsating Cepheid variable.

answer: "The {Whiteness} of the {Whale} "

This section of a larger work claims "Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright." It compares the narrator's reaction to the central phenomenon to a colt's instinctual fear of a buffalo robe shaken in front of it. This section imagines light "operating without medium upon matter," causing the "palsied universe" to lie "before us a leper," in its final paragraph, which ends with the narrator asking "Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?" It argues that the title phenomenon is both "the veil of the Christian's deity" and "the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind," such as milky fog, polar bears, and albinos. The forty-second chapter of the novel it appears in, it describes the fear that the title color invokes in Ishmael. For 10 points, name this chapter about the terror caused by the color of Moby-Dick.

answer: {variational} method or principle or {calculus}

V.I. Arnold used this technique to demonstrate that the energy functional is the same for the set of all flows isovortical to a given steady flow. This technique can be used in approximate solutions to the Boltzmann equation by showing that the correct solution is one for which a certain integral expression involving that solution is bounded above by zero. Another use of this method in statistical mechanics is to show that the condition of maximum probability is equivalent to the condition of maximum entropy. This technique is used in quantum mechanics to show that the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in any normalized state is at least as large as the ground state energy. This technique is also used to show that for the “correct,” trajectory, the time-integral of the Lagrangian, or the action, is stationary by slightly changing the action from the “true” path. Used in the derivation of Fermat’s principle of least time, for 10 points, identify this mathematical technique of finding a function which extremizes some variables.

answer: Robert {Schumann}

This composer's opus 2 ends with an unusual 26-bar pedal point on low D played below a combination of a waltz melody and a fragment from the "Grandfather's Dance," which this composer also quoted to symbolize pedantry in the final piece of his Opus 9. He adapted his third piano sonata in F minor from his earlier Concerto Without Orchestra, and composed simple pieces such as "The Happy Farmer" for his Opus 68, which is often used to teach beginning piano players. During his "year of chamber music," he composed his piano quintet in E flat major. As the cofounder and editor of the New Journal for Music, he exclaimed "hats off, gentlemen, a genius!" in his review of Chopin, and wrote the article "New Paths" heralding the arrival of the previously unknown Brahms. This composer's piano music includes his Waldszenen and his Kinderszenen, whose seventh piece depicts a reverie and is called "Traumerei." For 10 points, name this German Romantic composer who married the virtuoso pianist Clara Wieck.

In one paper, this philosopher cites Kierkegaard’s essay “The Present Age,” which argues that anonymity undermines commitment, to demonstrate why “Kierkegaard would have hated the Internet.” Another of this philosopher’s papers draws parallels between two philosophers’ use of the title concepts, and is titled “Being and Power.” With Paul Rabinow, this thinker authored a book entitled Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics, and in 1997, he engaged in a notable debate with Daniel Dennett regarding the recent match between Kasparov and Deep Blue. In addition to writing a popular exposition of Heidegger’s Being and Time entitled Being-in-the-world, this thinker wrote a work which critiqued the biological, psychological, epistemological, and ontological assumptions “underlying persistent optimism,” and argues for the “role of the body in intelligent behavior.” For 10 points, identify this phenomenologist and Heidegger exponent, a Berkeley philosopher whose criticism against artificial intelligence is contained in What Computers Still Can’t Do.

answer: {racially restrictive covenants} [or {racial covenants} ; or equivalents such as {covenants} which {prevent} non-whites from owning houses]

State courts broke with existing legal precedent to uphold these policies in cases such as Los Angeles Investment Co. v. Gary and Fairchild v. Raines. They arose in response to the ruling in Buchanan v. Worley, and their legality was upheld by the Supreme Court case Corrigan v. Buckley, inspiring Charles Hamilton Houston to develop a strategy to fight them. After these policies were ruled not binding on their members, they were largely replaced by the strategy of blockbusting. The 1945 study Black Metropolis argues that these policies are responsible for preserving the ghetto. Horace Cayton claimed that at their height, they covered eighty percent of Chicago. By the time they were ruled unenforceable in Shelley v. Kraemer, they were responsible for most of the housing segregation in Northern cities. For 10 points, name these private agreements which prevented nonwhites from owning houses in white neighborhoods.

One character in this novel loses the ability to speak after the drowning of his brother Mizban, with whom that character is working on cutting sea rock for port expansion. The reappearance of the former character, Hajem, results in a work disturbance that shifts the balance of power in this novel from Ibn Rashed to Dabbasi. After failing to convince the prince to expel the three American engineers who have come to the Wadi al-Uyoun oasis central to the action in this novel, the Bedouin patriarch Mut’ib rides into the desert and perishes. This novel ends with Fawaz, Mut’ib’s son, leading a workers’ strike on the compound of the emir Abu Misfer, which is headquartered in Harran, a fictional city located in a country modeled on Saudi Arabia. The first novel of a trilogy that continued with The Trench and Variations on Night and Day, for 10 points, identify this novel about the discovery of oil in an unnamed Arab nation, the most famous work of Abedlrahman Munif.

answer: {trans} effect

Grinberg’s theoretical basis for this phenomenon relies upon the ability of an induced dipole between the directing group and the central atom to weaken the bond with the leaving group. Chatt-Orgell theory describes this effect in compounds like Zeise’s anion, in which an ethylene substituent stabilizes the transition state by accepting pi-backbonding, allowing it to absorb some of the electron density on the central metal atom. The Kurnakov procedure uses the strength of this effect in molecules containing thiourea groups to make structural predictions. The Dhara synthesis relies on this effect because halides exhibit it more strongly than ammonium groups, allowing the second ammonium group to be added at the proper site to generate cisplatin. For 10 points, name this phenomenon that describes the effect of a coordinated ligand upon the rate of substitution at the site opposite to it.

answer: {Nagarjuna}

One story about this figure relates how he supposedly obtained the Perfection of Wisdom texts from the king of the nagas in exchange for teaching the king his philosophy. A central concept in this thinker’s philosophy is the notion of pratitya-samutpada, or “interdependence,” which characterizes conventional reality, and he advocated mahakaruna, or “great compassion,” as a means of transcending samsara. According to this thinker, the true cause of suffering was ignorance, which could be overcome through the realization of the anatman, or “no-self,” and he argued that in order to have svabhava, or “essence,” a thing must have a non-relational identify. Since nirvana is conceived of in opposition to samsara, this thinker argued that nirvana was not utimately real, and neither is anything else, and advocated that ignorance be counteracted through meditations on sunyata, or emptiness. For 10 points, identify this Mahayana sage who is famous for developing the Madhyamika, or “middle way,” school of Buddhism.

This opera's second act was completed four years before its other acts, and was first performed at the home of this opera's dedicatee, Pauline Viardot-Garcia. In its first act, the chorus's religious faith is mocked in the aria "Ce Dieu que votre voix implore" after this opera's lead tenor attempts to rouse the chorus in the arias "L’as-tu donc oublie" and "Arretez o mes freres." In the first scene of its third act, that tenor laments his condition in the aria "Vois ma misère, hélas!" This opera's three main mezzo-soprano arias, including “Amour, viens aider ma faiblesse” and "Printemps qui commence," are sung to tempt the male lead, who finally capitulates after hearing the aria "Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix." In this opera's final scene, priests dance a celebratory bacchanale in the Temple of Dagon before the first title character pulls it down over their heads. For 10 points, name this opera by Camille Saint-Saens about a judge of Israel who loses his strength because of his relationship with the title woman.

These proteins are responsible for the recognition step of the N-end pathway, and Meetei et al discovered that FANCL (fank-ell), rather than BRCA1 (bra-cah-one) plays this role in the Fanconi anemia pathway. Members of the catalytic subtype of these proteins have a HECT domain and perform their namesake action directly through a thioester intermediate, while the scaffold subtype of these proteins includes SCF-type complexes and the anaphase promoting complex. U-box-containing elongation factors can further modify the targets of these proteins, and all known scaffold-type proteins of this class contain, or bind to a protein containing, a RING finger domain. These proteins may bind their substrates by recognizing “destruction boxes,” and they are preceded in their pathway by activating and conjugating enzymes. For 10 points, name this class of enzymes responsible for marking target proteins for nuclear localization or proteolytic degradation by covalently attaching a 76-amino acid protein to them.

Prior to this event, one participant in it had subdued another participant despite the latter’s transformation into fire, water, a lion, and a serpent. One participant in this event had been selected specifically due to a prophecy that any child born to another participant in this event would become more powerful than his father. Taking place near Chiron’s cave at Mount Pelion, this event saw the gifting of a golden suit of armor, a spear, and two horses named Xanthus and Balius to one participant, who was the brother of Telamon. This event was also the site of the place where Eris, having not been invited to it, dropped an apple engraved with the phrase “To the fairest,” thereby precipitating the conflict which would see the eventual death of the offspring born as a result of this event.
