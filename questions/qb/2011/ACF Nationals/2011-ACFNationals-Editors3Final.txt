answer: {Indonesia}

One novel set in this country is narrated in parts by the clerk Drystubble, who obtains the story from a manuscript given to him by Shawlman. Another writer from this modern-day country used his village of Blora as the setting of a novella about this country’s occupations titled “She Who Surrenders.” That writer from this nation also wrote of a girl from this country who is married at age 14 to an aristocrat in his The Girl From the Coast. At the end of one novel set in this nation, the title colonial administrator is dismissed from his post despite pleading with the Governor-General; that novel was written by Eduard Dekker. This nation was famously home to the author of the Buru Quartet, who based his most famous novel on the life of the nationalist Tirto Adhi Soerjo; that novel is title This Earth of Mankind. For 10 points, identify this nation which was the setting for Multatuli’s Max Havelaar as well as pretty much all the works of its most famous author, Pramoedya Ananda Toer.

answer: {piano trios} [prompt on {trios} ]

The first of these pieces by Anton Arensky includes a third movement elegia commemorating Karl Davidov. A folk theme from the Yiddish play The Dybbuk inspired the only composition of this type by Aaron Copland, which evokes the shtetl of Vitebsk. Shostakovich imitated klezmer music in the final movement of his second one, which is in E minor. The only one by Ravel is in A minor, and features a second movement Pantoum. Dvorak's fourth, his opus 90, includes a melancholy melody that transitions into a fast folk dance in each of its six movements. The haunting slow music of the second movement of Beethoven's fifth caused Carl Czerny to nickname it the "Ghost." For 10 points, name this type of piece for three instruments, whose repertoire includes ones nicknamed "Dumky" and "Archduke."

answer: La {Follette Civil Liberties} Committee Hearings

The organization of this group was indirectly carried out by Gardner Jackson, who had invited this group’s namesake to speak at the Cosmos Club. This group was formed as the result of the passage of Resolution 266, introduced by the youngest senator since Henry Clay, and its formation was spurred by the judicial response to the Guffey Act. One action of this group, which took testimony from J. Warren Madden, was to investigate the violence that occurred when the Steel Workers’ Organizing Committee called its first strike against three companies colloquially known as “Little Steel;” that event was known as the Memorial Day massacre, and these hearings also investigated the working conditions of miners in Harlan County, Kentucky. Co-chaired by Senator Elbert D. Thomas of Utah, for 10 points, identify this committee that from 1936 to 1940 held a series of hearings into labor law violations, and which was led by its namesake, a Wisconsin senator and son of a Progressive presidential candidate.

At his death, this philosopher left unfinished his major work on religion, The Genius of Christianity Unveiled, and his other non-philosophical works include a History of the Commonwealth of England from its commencement to its restoration. This man's most famous philosophical work was attacked in Dr. Parr's Spital Sermon, and in that work this man proposed his "Famous Fire Cause," concluding that in the case of a fire, one should save the life of the Archbishop Fenelon rather than a common Valet. This man's reply to Malthus is contained in his work On Population, and his last philosophical work consists of 23 essays on topics such as astronomy, phrenology, and "intellectual abortion," entitled Thoughts on Man. Chapters such as "Of Property," "Of Crimes and Punishment," and "Principles of Government," can be found in his most famous treatise of political philosophy, Enquiry Concerning Political Justice. For 10 points, identify this liberal British philosopher best known for such works as Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and the philosophical novel Things as They Are; or, the Adventures of Caleb Williams.

This work features a wreath of bay leaves found below a damascened pair of greaves. Albertini suggested that its now lost base was made of variegated marble, while Vasari says that it was a simple column. Coveted by the French envoy, Pierre de Rohan, who wanted a copy, it was the centerpiece of a courtyard at the Medici Palace until it was moved to the Palazzo Pubblico. According to Janson, this work’s unheroic proportions are based on an ancient Greek Spinario, or image of a young boy. Now housed at the Bargello Museum, curators recently discovered that the titular subject’s wavy hair was once embellished with gold. It depicts its subject standing contrapposto, leaning on a sword, and naked save for his leg armor and a garlanded hat. For 10 points, name this bronze statue by Donatello that depicts the title figure triumphantly standing on Goliath’s head.

Keith Stanovich developed an interactive-compensatory model of this process, which is improved by the twelve-step Wilson system and the multisensory Orton-Gillingham method. Aptitude for this process is strongly correlated with the scores of Rapid Automatized Naming tests, lending support to the double-deficit hypothesis. This process is often taught using the Three Cueing Systems model. In the 1980's, Marie Clay developed a method for teaching this process in New Zealand, whose success popularized the "whole language" approach. Rudolf Flesch attacked the "look and say" method of teaching this process in his book Why Johnny Can't do this. For 10 points, name this process traditionally taught using phonics, which is impaired by dyslexia.

answer: {"Directive"}

This poem contrasts the "coolness" of an "enormous Glacier / that braced his feet against the Arctic Pole" with the "woods' excitement," which its speaker attributes to "upstart inexperience." This poem's images of the shrinking past include a lone field "no bigger than a harness gall" and "a belilaced cellar hole / Now slowly closing like a dent in dough." Its speaker asks the reader "if you're lost enough to find yourself by now / pull in your ladder road behind you / and put a sign up CLOSED to all but me," before showing the reader a "children's house of make believe." At the climax of this poem, the speaker leads the reader to a brook and uncovers "A broken drinking goblet like the Grail," which the speaker offers with the lines "Here are your waters and your watering place. Drink and be whole again beyond confusion." Beginning "Back out of all this now too much for us," for 10 points, name this poem whose speaker offers renewal by guiding the reader into the idyllic past, written by Robert Frost.

The first of these events appears to have occurred at a location called Rechru, and one of these events occurred under the leadership of a ruler known as “Caech,” or “the squinty.” Locations which witnessed repeated examples of these events include Iona and Skye, and a notable decrease in these events during the ninth century was called the “forty-years’ rest.” These events were succesfully opposed for a time by Aed Finnliath, and one of the last of these events, occurring in 1103, saw the death of Magnus Bare-Foot. A major one of these events resulted in the establishment of longhports, or settlements, in Annagassan, and these events often targeted monasteries such as the one at Armagh. Severely curtailed when Murchad, the son of Brian Boru, won the Battle of Clontarf, for 10 points, identify these military conflicts which pitted some roving Scandinavians against the inhabitants of a certain “Emerald Isle.”

answer: {Louhi} [accept {Mistress} of {Pohjola} or {Mistress} of {North Farm} before mention]

To prepare for a wedding, this figure orders the killing of a giant ox, which is finally slain by a water god wielding a copper sword. This figure stole the moon and the sun and hid them in “iron-banded mountains,” which results in the creation of a new sun from a god’s flame that is rocked by a virgin. One test set to another character by this figure involves putting a bridle on a horse that breathes fire from its nostrils, while another test is passed by lassoing a moose. In exchange for an object made from tips of white swan feather and a single grain of barley, among other things, this character gives away her daughter in marriage. This character’s husband is killed by a man sometimes called the Ahti Islander, and under this woman’s supervision, the nine sicknesses are born to the crone Loviatar. In the form of an eagle, this ruler of North Farm attacks Vainamoinen’s ship, which results in the destruction of the Sampo. For 10 points, identify this witch who rules Pohjola, the major antagonist of the Kalevala.

Marcel Tyberg performed this task between 1927 and 1928, although his result was premiered in 2010. When Anton Safronov performed this task, he used a melody the Marche Héroïque piano duet. Frank Merrick won the English category of a 1928 contest held by the Columbia Gramophone Company to perform this task, although the rules of that contest were expanded to allow original compositions as well. Mario Venzago and Brian Newbould performed this task based on the hypothesis that the entr’acte from the incidental music to Rosamunde was originally intended to be part of a composition whose third-movement scherzo is mostly scored for piano only. For 10 points, name this task which involves writing the scherzo and finale of a partially completed orchestral work by Franz Schubert.

answer: Affair of the {Spanish Marriages} [accept anything mentioning {Spain} and {weddings} ]

This event occurred in part because a letter intended for Henry Bulwer had been read in the presence of Count Jarnac, and an indirect consequence of this event was the Austrian annexation of Krakow. The individual who engineered this event in doing so broke a promise earlier made to Lord Aberdeen, and this event was planned to counteract the involvement of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. Although Lord Palmerston protested that this event violated the treaty of Utrecht, this event was nevertheless engineered by Francois Guizot, who feared British support of the Progresistas against the Moderados supported by France. For 10 points, identify this 1846 affair which saw the union of Isabella II and Francisco de Bourbon, duke of Cadiz, as well as Luisa Fernanda and Antonie, duc de Montpensier, the son of Louis-Phillippe, intended to secure French succession to the throne of an Iberian neighbor.

One analytical tool for analyzing these objects is a technique which decomposes them into their 1D equivalents, called the effective index method, while Marcatili’s method for analyzing them relies on the assumption that their fields are confined to the core. In the case of perturbed boundary conditions, the attenuation constant beta of the mixed modes in these structures takes on a value dependent on the average of the betas of the orthonormal modes minus a term dependent on the mode coupling. For each solution of the eigen value problem within these structures, transverse propagations can only occur at frequencies above the cutoff frequency. If the ends of one of these objects is closed, a resonant cavity is obtained, and like a cavity, the field inside one of these objects is described by a combination of TE, TM, and TEM propagations. For 10 points, identify these open-ended tubes which can be either cylindrical or rectangular, and which are designed to propagate electromagnetic radiation.

After leaving this movement, one of its members went on to design a building whose square tower was topped by four male nudes, the Palais Stoclet. Another member of this artistic movement depicted a black-haired woman holding an hourglass on the cover of his Religious Calendar. A more famous member of this movement depicted a goddess holding a spear and an apple on which a woman stood with outstretched hands. Members of this artistic movement exhibited in a gallery topped by a golden-leafed dome and designed by a member of this movement, Josef Maria Olbrich. Founded in 1897 after the example of a similar movement in Munich by Josef Hoffman and Koloman Moser, among others, this movement’s most famous artist painted the aforementioned Pallas Athene and depicted a pregnant woman with pendulous breasts in a blue sarong and a man and a woman embracing under a sun and moon in his Beethoven Frieze. For 10 points, identify this artistic movement growing out of Art Nouveau and headed by Gustav Klimt in its namesake city.

This ruler’s downfall occurred shortly after he nullified elections that had been won by Guillermo Endara Galimany. In one post, this man interfered to secure the release of several freighter crews being held in Havana, and this man’s connection to figures such as William Casey was the subject of a book by reporter John Dinges. This man engineered the deposition of Nicolas Barletta and replaced him with Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was himself deposed after a crisis during which Roberto Diaz Herrera accused this man of murdering opponents such as Hugo Spadafora and of drug trafficking. A participant in the coup that unseated Arnulfo Arias, this man became the head of the intelligence services under the rule of Omar Torrijos, and came to power in 1983 following the death of Torrijos in a plane crash. For 10 points, identify this leader who was deposed during Operation Just Cause when US forces invaded Panama.

Amplification of these phenomena can occur via over-reflection in the SWING mechanism, which, when present, dominates their WASER amplification mechanism that relies on over-refraction and a Q-barrier. The global stability criterion for a system against their axisymmetric type is a value of at least 1 everywhere for the Toomre Q parameter. Their long type propagate in the principal range between the inner and outer Lindblad resonances. They transport energy and angular momentum outwards outside of a co-rotation radius at which the disk's angular speed matches their pattern speed. They are excited by resonances with Janus, Epimetheus and other moons near Saturn's A ring. For 10 points, name these disturbances hypothesized by Lin and Shu that solve the winding problem of arms of spiral galaxies.

answer: Herbert George {Wells}

The narrator of one of this author's novels attempts to save his family's financial empire by stealing heaps of radioactive quap from Mordet Island. In that novel, a chemist's rising social status is marked by his purchases of Lady Grove and Crest Hill after he becomes rich selling a product marketed as "the spirit of vigor." This author plagiarized much of his most successful work of non-fiction from Florence Deeks. He was enormously popular in the 1910s thanks to novels such as Ann Veronica and Mr. Britling Sees It Through, and achieved his highest critical success with a novel about George and Teddy Ponderevo. This author advocated a single world government in his novels The World Set Free and The Shape of Things to Come, and attempted to describe "the whole story of man" in The Outline of History. For 10 points, name this British author of Tono-Bungay who pioneered science fiction in his books The Island of Dr. Moreau and The War of the Worlds.
