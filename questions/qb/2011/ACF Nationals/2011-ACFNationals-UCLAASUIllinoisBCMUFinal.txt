answer: Battle of {Hattin} [or Horns of {Hattin} ]

An anonymous account of this battle is preserved in the Chronicon Anglicanum of Ralph of Coggeshall, and another account comes to us in various Eracles and was written by the chronicler Ernoul. That source blames this defeat on the tension between poulains and the Poitevins, and it was an attempt to relieve a besieged city defended by the Countess Eschiva. Prior to this battle, a force under Gerard of Ridefort was wiped out at Cresson, and in its aftermath the victors were able to take a city defended by Balian of Ibelin. The victors in this battle invaded the defenders’ territory to retaliate for raiding by the Lord of Kerak Castle, Raynald of Chatillon, who was captured at this battle and personally executed by the victorious commander. Despite the advice of Raymond III of Tripoli, the losing force abandoned their defensible position at Sephoria in order to relieve a siege of Tiberias. The victorious force burned the surrounding brush in this battle in order to exacerbate the losing side’s lack of water, and it resulted in the capture of Guy of Lusignan. For 10 points, name this 1187 victory for Saladin which allowed him to capture Jerusalem, and which was fought at the foot of two peaks known as its namesake “horns.”

answer: {Uncle Vanya} [or {Dyadya Vanya} ]

During an awkward silence in this play, one character remarks that it is “a fine day to hang oneself,” and he later tells another character that she has “mermaid blood.” An old woman in this play has spent her entire life reading pamphlets, and another character steals a bottle of morphine from a doctor, but he is convinced to return it before he uses it to commit suicide. This play ends with one character repeating the line “we shall rest” while Telegin plays his guitar. A doctor in this play feels that his true calling is in forestry, and after showing a map depicting the degeneration of the countryside, he kisses the unwilling Elena. The title character of this play rants about how another man knows nothing of art despite being a retired art professor, and he attempts to shoot that professor twice with a revolver after the professor expresses a desire to sell the estate where this play takes place. The doctor Astrov visits the estate of the professor Serebryakov in this play, and it was adapted from its author’s earlier work The Wood Demon. For 10 points, name this Anton Chekhov play whose title character is Ivan Voinitsky.

answer: {rigid designator}

The theory of these objects was informally introduced through by Ruth Barcan Marcus in her 1961 article "Modalities in Intensional Language." David Kaplan presented a theory of these philosophical ideas in a lecture later published as "Dthat" shortly after they were formally introduced in a lecture series by their best-known popularizer. One of the uses of these philosophical concepts is to demonstrate the existence of necessary a posteriori propositions and contingent a priori propositions, and the inventor of this term proposed that proper names and natural kinds such as water are examples of these. Originally proposed in their best-known form in the lectures that became Naming and Necessity through the example of Hesperus and Phosphorus being the same object, for ten points, identify these philosophical concepts whose name was coined by Saul Kripke which refers to a description that has the same reference in every possible world.

answer: {pair production}

The occurrence of this phenomenon explains the direct correlation between absorption coefficient and frequency at high frequencies. This phenomenon can occur in gravitational fields with acceleration greater than two times the speed of light squared over the Compton wavelength, and that instance of this phenomenon explains the nonexistence of micro black holes. Patrick Blackett first proposed this phenomenon while observing cosmic ray showers in a cloud chamber, and in order for this process to occur, a certain particle must possess energy greater than 1.022 MeV. The spontaneous occurrence of this phenomenon near the event horizon of a black hole results in the black hole losing energy through the process of Hawking Radiation. This phenomenon classically occurs when a photon passing near an atomic nucleus has energy equivalent to twice the rest mass of an electron. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which the photon splits into an electron and a positron.

answer: {Miletus}

Herodotus relates that a tyrant of this polis gave advice to Periander of Corinth on how to rule his people by walking through a grain field and chopping off the tallest stalks. Another ruler of this polis argued contrary to Miltiades that the Greeks should not destroy a bridge over the Hellespont at the request of the Scythians. That ruler of this polis supposedly sent a message by tattooing the head of a slave, and his successor attempted to bribe Cleomenes I of Sparta into joining him in a military venture. This polis controlled the second most important oracle of Apollo, which was located at Didyma, and it was home to the historian Hecataeus. In addition to being ruled by the tyrants Thrasybulus and Histiaeus, this polis was ruled by a man who antagonized Megabates while leading a failed expedition against Naxos. This city was sacked after it lost the naval Battle of Lade, and under its tyrant Aristagoras it attacked the forces of Artaphernes and burned Sardis. This city led a revolt against the Persians as the greatest city of Ionia. For 10 points, name this western Anatolian city that was also home to philosophers like Anaximander and Thales.

answer: The {Burial} of {Count Orgaz}

Robert Byron argued that this painting’s composition was modeled after its artist’s earlier Dormition of the Virgin. A saint holds a bent iron at the front of a group of martyrs and apostles in the upper right of this painting, whose bottom is six feet off of the floor, requiring viewers to look sharply upward to see all of it. At the top of this painting, a yellow-clad St. Peter dangles two keys from his right hand on the left of a triangular Dëesis, which depicts John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary kneeling below a standing, white-clad Jesus. At its bottom, men carrying torches flank a line of black-clad nobles wearing white ruffs, who divide this painting’s scene of ethereal, heavenly clouds from its depiction of St. Augustine and St. Stephen lowering the body of the title character. Located at the church of San Tome in Toledo, for 10 points, name this painting of the entombment of the title character, a work by El Greco.

answer: {Orion} (or {Orion Crew Exploration} Vehicle)

A vehicle of this name will have functional testing of its STORRM risk mitigation hardware during the final mission of Space Shuttle Endeavour. The constellation of this name is home to the prototype star for very high accretion rate, very luminous outburst episode pre-main sequence stars; that prototype is this constellation's star FU. Another star in this constellation was the target of interferometric observations by Michelson that yielded the first measurement of the angular diameter of a star other than the Sun. Innovative safety and life support systems allow missions up to six months long on the "next generation" manned space vehicle of this name. This constellation is home to Barnard's Loop, which is part of its namesake Molecular Cloud Complex that also includes the Horsehead Nebula and the Trapezium Cluster. An asterism consisting of Alnilam, Mintaka and Alnitak can be found in, for 10 points, what constellation whose brightest stars are Rigel and Betelgeuse?

answer: {confession} of {sins} [accept {rough} equivalents like {atonement} for {sins} or any {synonym implying} that the {sin} is {being told} to {someone else}]

A theory of this religious practice as arising from magic was formulated by Raffaele Pettazzoni, and among the Kikuyu, this practice is accompanied by vomiting. Among the Lotuko people of East Sudan, this practice is conducted by warriors in public before the start of the hunting season, while in Meso-American religions this practice was carried out in the presence of the priests of Tlazolteotl. Zoroastrianism called this practice patet and it could be performed in front of the sun, moon, and divine fire, while Jain monks must perform this action, called pratikarmana, twice daily. In one Christian denominations, this practice is incomplete if only attritio is present rather than contritio. This practice is most commonly associated in the West with communication with a priest, which if done properly ends with the priest saying “ego te absolvo.” For ten points, identify this religious practice, the cornerstone of the Roman Catholic Sacrament of Penitence.

answer: Election of {1992}

One candidate in this election hired Hamilton Jordan and Ed Rollins to manage his campaign, only to alienate them by demanding that his volunteers sign loyalty oaths. A candidate who failed to capture the Democratic nomination in this election issued a fiscal plan named A Call to Economic Arms, and responded to questions about its lack of tax cuts by saying "I'm not Santa Claus." The keynote speech at this election's Republican National Convention claimed that the United States is in the midst of a "religious war" for "the soul of America," which became known as the "culture war" speech. A third-party candidate in this election claimed that a proposed treaty would lead to a "giant sucking sound" of American jobs. Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown lost the Democratic nomination to a candidate who campaigned on the slogan "it's the economy, stupid." The losing candidate in this election was widely seen as reneging on his promise "read my lips: no new taxes," and lost votes to Ross Perot. For 10 points, name this election in which George H. W. Bush lost to Bill Clinton.

Zhang showed that curvature and indeterminacy are independent in the type of this object named for King, Plosser, and Rebelo, but not in the Bennett-Farmer variety under endogenous time preference. The isoelastic type of this object is a special case of HARA that assumes Brownian motion in continuous time. Rabin incorporated fairness into this object, which is often restricted to be quasiconcave. An axiomatic theory of these objects assumes rationality by requiring completeness, independence, transitivity and continuity, and is named for Morgenstern and Von Neumann. An early one of these resolved the St. Petersburg Paradox and is named for Bernoulli, who suggested it was logarithmic. For 10 points, name this type of function from consumer theory whose graphical representation is an indifference curve.

This property is preserved by a map between Banach spaces if that map is bounded, surjective, and linear. The Baire Category Theorem characterizes spaces in which a countable intersection of dense sets with this property is also dense. In complex analysis, non-constant analytic functions on a region preserve this property. This property is not closed, but a function is continuous if and only if its inverse preserves this property. A topology is defined with a collection of subsets with this property such that this property is preserved for arbitrary unions and finite intersections, and a set is compact if it has a finite subcover for every cover with this property. A set has this property if every neighborhood of every element in the set is contained within the set. The interior of a set is the maximal subset having this property. For 10 points, name this property possessed by a set if it is the complement of a closed set.

answer: Lord {Salisbury} [or {Robert Gascoyne}-{Cecil}, {3rd Marquess} of {Salisbury}]

A grandson of this man had a speech impediment which led him to famously ask “Wab or Hawold” when deciding who should succeed Anthony Eden, and a son of this British politician joined with Jan Smuts and Woodrow Wilson to design the League of Nations, for which he was awarded the 1937 Nobel Peace Prize. This man argued that the Monroe Doctrine had no place in international law in response to a letter from Richard Olney, but he eventually backed down on the Venezuela boundary dispute. This Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance proposed by his Foreign Secretary Lord Lansdowne, and he himself first came to prominence as Foreign Secretary in his role organizing the Congress of Berlin. This PM worked with Théophile Delcassé to bring about a peaceful resolution to the Fashoda Incident, and he formed a coalition government with the Liberal Unionists which was inherited by his nephew and successor as PM, Arthur Balfour. This noted opponent of Irish Home Rule served as PM during the Boer War. For 10 points, name this Conservative politician who succeeded Disraeli as the chief rival of Gladstone, and who was the last PM to come from the House of Lords.

answer: Wolfgang Amadeus {Mozart’s} Symphony no. {40} in G minor [or the {Great Symphony} in G minor before mentioned; or {K550} ]

The first two of Leonard Bernstein’s Norton Lectures analyzed the structure of this symphony, whose score unusually omits trumpets and timpani. Although its woodwind section was originally scored for flute, two bassoons, and two oboes, its composer revised this symphony’s oboe music to include two B-flat clarinets. Its finale’s development begins with a ten-tone row which omits G natural, the tonic of this symphony’s key. Unusually for Classical symphonies, its first movement opens with an accompaniment played by the violas before the violins introduce its main melody, which repeats the notes E flat, D, and D three times and then ascends to a quarter note in B flat. To differentiate it from its composer’s 25th symphony in the same key, it is often known as its composer’s “Great” symphony in G minor. For 10 points, name this symphony by Mozart, who composed it before the Jupiter symphony.

This disease is most commonly caused by a silent mutation at Gly-608 that results in utilization of a cryptic splice site, causing the protein mutated in this disease to be permanently farnesylated. The coxa valga malformation in this disease predisposes sufferers to hip displacement and, while affected individuals appear largely normal at birth, they may present with midfacial cyanosis. Defects in base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair, such as Werner syndrome or Cockayne syndrome, can cause the segmental type of this disease, but the conventional type of this disease is also known as Hutchinson-Gilman syndrome and results from the formation of a namesake truncated splicing mutant of lamin A. This leads to alopecia, loss of subcutaneous fat, and severe atherosclerosis and predisposition to strokes. For 10 points, name this disease that causes accelerated aging.

One character in this novel gives a drunken rant about how a Chinese delicacy is made by burying a tin box and allowing the maggots inside to eat each other. A character in this novel gives a lecture on “dying into heaven,” which is connected with “black lightning” throughout the book. The protagonist of this novel was an actor in a theater company run by Pete, and he threatens to crash his car after Mary refuses to sleep with him. Mary later marries a character described as extremely tall and thin, Nathaniel, who the protagonist tries to kill by knocking him off his customary perch on a ship’s starboard rail. The protagonist calls the place where he eats the “Red Lion,” and he attaches a candy wrapper to the head of a figure he constructs out of stones, the “Dwarf.” The title character realizes he is mad when he finds that the surrounding world resembles the contours of his teeth, and at the end of this novel the title character’s corpse is revealed to still have its seaboots on despite him supposedly removing them in the first pages. For 10 points, name this novel in which attempts to survive on a barren rock are hallucinated by a drowning sailor, a work by William Golding.
