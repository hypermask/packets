answer: {code-switching} [or {code-mixing} ]

Carol Myers-Scotton developed the Markedness Model for this phenomenon, claiming that it is used to index social codes. Shana Poplack studied this phenomenon among Puerto Ricans in New York in a seminal work which proposed the equivalence constraint on this phenomenon, which states that it cannot occur at points which would violate the syntactic rules of either language. Phonological and morphological integration can be used as criteria to distinguish it from borrowing. Early scholars treated it as substandard usage, but it was later discovered that balanced bilinguals are more likely to engage in it than non-balanced bilinguals. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which multilinguals alternate fluidly between languages in conversation.

answer: {Typhon}

Though he’s neither Hephaestus nor Zeus, this entity has an alternative origin myth, in the Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo, according to which he was raised in a Cilician cave, possibly known as Arima, after Minoan Hera created him at Delos through parthenogenesis. Several modern scholars postulate the Hittite deity Illuyanka as his archetype while Herodotus records that the Egyptians syncretized this figure with Set. This being induced the gods to change into animals upon his approach, whereupon his greatest rival became a ram and fled. That rival was initially defeated, trapped in a korukos, and stripped of sinews, but, as recorded in Pindar’s first Pythian Ode, this being was himself trapped when that rival escaped and broke up a flying rock. The resulting mountain was inhabited by one of Phorcys’ daughters, this monster’s consort. The offspring of Gaia by Tartarus, for 10 points, name this great enemy to Zeus and progenitor of Ladon, Orthrus, the Sphinx, and Cerberus, which he fathered on Echidna.

answer: The {Beaver Coat} or {Der Biberpelz}

One character in this work refuses to get out of bed and go to chop wood, complaining that she has been mistreated by her employer. Another character in this work is a former ranger who lost his job after losing an eye in an accident, and who purchases a poached stag from the main family for 17 shillings. This play features a justice of the peace who is looking for a way to rig incriminating evidence against an opponent, and that justice is later reproached for consorting with the moocher Motes. In a courtroom scene in this play, Doctor Fleischer claims to have seen the boatman Wulkow in possession of the title object, who had in fact purchased it, but Wulkow escapes punishment when the justice von Wehrhahn claims he would have to search every house in town based on the flimsy testimony. For ten points, identify this play about the grifter family of Julius and Mrs. Wolff which concerns Kruger’s attempts to recover the titular stolen piece of clothing, a comedy by Gerhart Hauptmann

answer: {Parker spiral}

Mathematically, this phenomenon can be represented by setting helicity equal to the integral of the net flux through the North Pole to a co-latitude of sixty degrees. In 1991, Smith and Bieber provided the calculations that would further describe this quantity correctly, and planes called “neutral current sheets” divvy up the regions of this phenomenon. The Ulysses mission confirmed the distribution that underlies this object, even when accounting for the sixty degree deviation occurring around a certain body’s equator. This shape’s interaction with other bodies was found to affect its consistency by Pioneer 11, and this characteristic is present from one astronomical unit to eight and a half astronomical units due to prominences applying a force similar to torque on magnetic particles. For 10 points, name this shape that describes the sun’s magnetic field due to the solar wind twisting it, named for an American astrophysicist.

answer: {Rouen} Cathedral

This building’s window depicting Joseph is inscribed Clemens vitrearius carnotensis me fecit, the only signed example of a window from its period. A Camille Pissarro painting portrays an old market in front of this building, one of whose towers was funded by allowing donors to eat butter during Lent. A tomb in this building supposedly contains the heart of Richard the Lion-Heart. Its transcept features the Bookseller’s Stairway, and its lantern tower was rebuilt with a cast-iron spire in the nineteenth century, making it the largest building in the world from 1876 to 1880. A set of paintings depicting light striking this building at different times of the day was painted in 1892 and 1893. For 10 points, name this cathedral in Northwestern France, the subject of a series of paintings by Claude Monet.

answer: A {Letter Concerning Toleration}

One section of this work claims that a man’s “immortal soul” gains happiness by “doing those things in this life which are necessary to the obtaining of God's favour.” Another section of this work deems it to be “a secret evil,” “when men arrogate to themselves” and their “sect” a “peculiar prerogative covered over with a specious show of deceitful words.” This work notes that in the “Jewish commonwealth” idolaters “fall under a double consideration” containing “those who apostatise” who are prosecuted as “traitors and rebels” and “foreigners” who “were not compelled by force to observe the rites of the Mosaical law” This work argues that a man who “denies not anything that the Holy Scriptures” and does not “makes a separation” of “anything that is not manifestly contained in the sacred text” cannot “be either a heretic or schismatic” though it also claims that “Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society” do not hold for one specific group of people. For 10 points name this work that argues for religious rights for pretty much everyone except atheists, a work of John Locke.

answer: the {symphonies} of Dmitri {Shostakovich}

The final movement of one of these pieces includes an English horn solo following a cymbal crash that cuts off an extended march, and is punctuated by the alarms of a G minor warning bell. Another of these pieces includes a third movement nocturne in which the horn repeatedly plays a five-note motif whose pitches spell the name Elmira. The third movement Largo in the fourth of them begins with a funeral march inspired by the music of Mahler. The tenth of them is the first of their composer’s works to feature the four-note motif D-E flat-C-B, while the programmatic eleventh one is subtitled “the Year 1905.” The fifth one was composed in response to articles such as “Chaos Instead of Music,” which denounced its composer as a bourgeois formalist. The seventh is dominated by a twenty-two bar “invasion” theme. For 10 point, identify this group of fifteen orchestral works including ones named “Babi Yar” and “Leningrad.”

answer: {Baron Antoine Jean}-{Gros} [or {Jean}-{Antoine Gros}]

One work painted by this artist during his time in Italy is modeled after Rigaud’s “Marichal de Matigum,” and that work was itself similar to the artists own portrait of Lewis Berthier in which the title figure’s left arm is out is outstretched towards a barely visible tattered bridge. In another of his works, a nude black yarmulked man is trampled between two horses, one white, one brown amidst scattered turbaned bodies draped in red. He drew from Botticelli for a portrait where the female subject leans on a rock next to a stream behind a waterfall. In addition to his Battle of Aboukir and Portrait of Christine Boyer. He is also responsible for a work that in earlier iterations saw the title figure carrying a body across a hospital, a figure who, in another work, this artist depicted in a bow-tied robe holding a flag and a sword “On the Bridge of Arcole.” For 10 points name this neo-classicist who painted a work in which figures writhed in agony on the sand while the title figure touches a sick man, Napoleon in the Pest House in Jaffa.

answer: Council of {Basel} (accept {Council} of {Florence} before {Florence} is mentioned)

John of Palomar and John of Ragusa arrived for this event to represent the same predecessor and successor of Bishop Philibert. Several years later, the rival factions at this meeting sang their own Te Deum and shouted their own Placet even when this meeting claimed “concordantia catholica” or universal harmony. A candidate for Trier’s archbishopric, Ulrich von Manderschied, sent a representative to this meeting to appeal to the pope, whose papal authority was under that of the council of bishops as established by the Haec sancta decree from the preceding Council of Constance. That representative, Nicholas of Cusa, reversed his conciliar position by supporting Pope Eugene IV. Shifting location to Ferrara and then to Florence midway, for 10 points, this 1431 general council started by Martin V which unsuccessfully attempted to reunify the Western and Eastern church and was based in a Swiss town.

answer: {Senegal}

This country is subject to a light precipitation that its natives call the heug, which is brought by the harmattan winds. This nation’s major river forms a so-called False Delta, which is home to the town of Richard-Toll, and its mouth is home to a former colonial capital. As a consequence of its location within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, this nation’s climate experiences a tripartite division into coastal, Sahelian, and Sudanian climates, and the majority of the agriculture is practiced in this country’s Fouta region. Other regions of this nation to the north of Guinea include the Casamance, from which guerilla fighters once operated during a conflict in neighboring Guinea-Bissau. This country’s namesake river separates it from Mauritania and its capital is located on the Cape Verde Peninsula on the Atlantic shore. Ethnic groups in this nation include the Serer, Malinke, and Fulani, as well as its dominant ethnic and linguistic group, the Wolof. For ten points, identify this African nation with capital at Dakar.

answer: {Virginia}

One case arising from events in this state saw the Supreme Court rule that the execution of mentally retarded criminals was unconstitutional; that case was Atkins versus this state. Another case originating in this state resulted from the plaintiff’s inheritance of land belonging to his uncle, Lord Fairfax, which this state seized; in that case, the Supreme Court, behind Joseph Story’s opinion, held that Jay’s Treaty superseded that laws of this state in accordance with the supremacy clause. This state was also the defendant in a case which saw the unanimous affirmation of the Supreme Court as the arbiter of disputes between the states and the national government, pursuant to the 1789 Judiciary Act, but upheld the fining of the Cohen brothers for selling lottery tickets. The state from which the case of Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee originated, for ten points, identify this state which lost a 14th Amendment challenge against its anti-miscegenation laws brought by Mildred Jeter and her husband Richard Loving.

answer: Robert {Mugabe}

Fireforce tactics were used against this man's forces in one war by a force partially supported by John Vorster. That war involving this man was effectively ended with the Lancaster House Agreement, and was called the Chimurenga, or Bush War. It was waged against this man's predecessor as Prime Minister, who signed the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, Ian Smith. After being elected Prime Minister in 1980, this man ascended to the presidency in 1987 after accusing the author of The Gospel According to the Ghetto, Canaan Banana, of sodomy. This man currently shares leadership of his country with fellow party member and Vice President Joice Mujuru and opposition party Movement for Democratic Change Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. This man is well known for his extensive series of land redistributions, and for pushing his nation's currency to extremely inflated levels. For 10 points name this man, the former Secretary General of the revolutionary group ZANU and the current president of Zimbabwe.

answer: Sir Edward Richard George {Heath}

This person’s most important victory occurred in the first election after the Representation of the People Act, which reduced the voting age to 18. A key issue in that election was the decimalization of coinage decreed by the eventual loser, but implemented by this politician’s government; it rendered both men unpopular and contributed to this man’s loss in a subsequent election, where he used the slogan “Who Governs Britain.” An event of debatable magnitude in the lead-up to the election of this Prime Minister was a 1968 speech paraphrasing Virgil made by his subordinate Shadow Defense Secretary; that speech led this man to fire its author, Enoch Powell, and was the anti-immigration “Rivers of Blood” speech. For 10 points, name this leader of the British Conservative party from 1965, Prime Minister from 1970 to 1974, and longtime nemesis of Harold Wilson.

answer: {Malpighian tubules}

The Kruppel gene is anomalously upregulated by huckebein and tailless in this tissue. Two new species of spore-forming protists were recently found in these structures in the species Archimandrita tessellata and Lucihormetica verrucosa, whose adults may have up to 150 of them whereas the embryos typically have only four. These structures play a role in immunity by secreting antimicrobial peptides that kill pathogens completely independently of the fat body. The transcription factors Teashirt and Tiptop act redundantly in stellate cells, which take part in chloride ion conductance in these structures whereas principal cells contain proton/cation exchangers for osmoregulation. Hemolymph passes through one layer of cuboidal epithelial cells to reach the lumen of, for 10 points, these structures used for renal excretion in insects.

answer: {boundary layer} flow

A special case of steady momentum conservation in this type of flow is given by the equation f-triple-prime plus half f, f-double-prime equals zero, where f is a scaled speed and primes are derivatives with respect to a similarity variable; that’s the Blasius equation. In general, steady momentum conservation in this type of flow is given by setting the convective derivative of the velocity equal to the viscosity times the second spanwise partial derivative of the streamwise velocity; that equation is named for this type of flow. Posited as a way to use the Euler equations while getting around d’Alembert’s paradox, this type of flow occurs near no-slip surfaces, at which the flow speed must vanish, so it is viscosity-dominated. For 10 points, name this special type of flow proposed by Ludwig Prandtl to explain what happens near the edges of a fluid.

answer: {Baeyer-Villiger} oxidation

This reaction can produce a precursor of a compound named for Prelog and Djerassi when the product is treated with a Lewis acid in an aprotic solvent via a rearrangement. One synthetic transformation of this reaction can introduce a bridgehead hydroxyl group after the use of an acetyl functionality to synthesize gibberellic acid in an aldol condensation. The first step of this reaction leads to a tetrahedral intermediate upon the addition of a peracid like MCPBA whereas the second step is a concerted migration that causes the bond between two oxygens to break, a mechanism, which, as in ozonolysis, was elucidated by and named for Criegee. For 10 points, name this reaction discovered by two namesakes in 1899 that describes the oxidation of ketones into lactones or esters.
