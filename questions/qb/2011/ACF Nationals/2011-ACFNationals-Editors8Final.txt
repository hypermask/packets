answer: {demyelination} [accept {demyelinization}; accept anything {indicating} that {myelin} is {being destroyed} or is {degenerating}]

Aquaporin-4 and P2 are targets during this process, and animal models for this process are generated by infecting rodents with Theiler’s virus or with JHM virus, which causes the onset of EAE. It can be detected by excretion of proteolytic fragments of MBP. A defect in the aspartoacylase gene causes this process to occur in Canavan’s disease, while it is caused by galactosylphingosine buildup in Krabbe disease. Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia can cause this process to occur in the pons, and the reversal of this process is observed in “shadow plaques”. This process is most commonly seen in a disease whose diagnostic markers include optic neuritis and oligoclonal banding in the cerebrospinal fluid; that disease disproportionately affects people with the DR-2 haplotype, especially Caucasian women from northern climates. For 10 points, name this process that can be caused by the destruction of oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells in diseases like multiple sclerosis.

answer: The {Peony Pavillion} [or {Mudan Ting} ]

This work is rarely staged in its entirety due to the fact that it comprises 55 scenes, the last of which is titled “Reunion at Court.” A comic episode in scene 23 of this work occurs when Judge Hu sentences four sinners to be reborn from eggs, which one of them interprets as being born from Muslim balls. In the 51st scene, this play’s main character is proclaimed to be the Prize Candidate, and that character is later reconciled with his love and her father, Du Bao. In this play, Du Liniang, the daughter of a government official, ostensibly dies of a broken heart, only to be discovered alive again when her spirit appears to Liu Mengmei, whom Liniang saw in the scene “Interrupted Dream,” and fell in love with. One the four works in the collection Lin-chuan’s Four Dreams, for 10 points, identify this dramatic work written in the Kunqu tradition of Chinese opera by Tang Xianzu, which takes its name from the flower garden in which Liu Mengmei and Du Liniang meet.

answer: {Pathet Lao} [or {Lao Nation} ]

During a diplomatic mission, J. Graham Parsons pressed for the breaking of diplomatic ties with this organization, which held British diplomat Mervyn Brown captive for a month in 1962. Together with four neutralists and four members of an opposition party, four members of this organization made up the Provisional Government of National Union. In its early days this organization, whose political wing was known as the Hak Xat, held itself in opposition to phu nyai, or “big man,” politics. The book Man in the Region of Death was an account of this organization’s prison camps by former RLG official Thongthip Rathanavilai, though unlike the Khmer Rouge this organization never established massive death camps. During its heyday, this organization was headed by Kaysone Phomvihan and Prince Souphanuvong, and in 1975 it succeeded in overthrowing the US-backed government based in Vientiane. For 10 points, identify this Communist organization which in 1975 became the governing party of Laos.

answer: The {Conformist} [or {Il Conformista}]

In one episode in this film, after the title character purchases a violet from a flowergirl, she and several other children begin to sing La Marseillese. This film’s title character arranges for the killing of his mother’s chauffeur and morphine procurer named Hemlock, and interspersed throughout this film are the title character’s reminiscences of being sexually assaulted as a boy by another chauffeur named Lino. While confessing to a priest, the title character of this film claims to be part of a group that “tracks down all the subversives;” that confession is made prior to marrying Giulia, which the title character thinks will give him “the impression of normalcy.” This film’s title character travels to Paris to see his old teacher Luca Quadri, an anti-Fascist dissident, and arranges for the assasination of both Luca and his wife Anna, and at the end of the film falsely denounces his former friend Italo for the murder, leaving him to be killed by a mob. For 10 points, identify this Bernardo Bertolucci film about the Fascist Marcelo Clerici, who desires not to feel different from anyone else.

answer: {locality}

In a recent paper, Robert Griffiths of CMU has argued that this property is identical to the factorization condition used in deriving the CHSH theorem, and has claimed that it is always present so long as the probabilities are evaluated on the proper sample spaces. In the formalism of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber, the absence of this property is equivalent to the occurrence of outcome-dependence. The absence of this property is explicitly assumed in the velocity guiding equation that is central to the Bohm formalism. No theory can contain hidden variables, reproduce the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics, and possess this property as a consequence of Bell’s theorem. This phenomenon is violated by entanglement, and its presence was assumed by the EPR thought experiment. For 10 points, identify this property absent in quantum mechanics according to which no influence can propagate faster than the speed of light.

answer: Saga of {Burnt Njal} [accept anything mentioning {Njal}]

One character in this work is warned by his dog of the approach of a band led by a priest that is coming to kill him, and consequently kills two and wounds sixteen before succumbing. While riding with Thord Freemanson, the title character explains that Thord’s vision of a goat wallowing in blood was really a fylgja, or a prefiguration of Thord’s own death. This work’s title character is the friend of Gunnar, but the two quarrel when their wives, Bergthora and Hallgerda, urge them to escalate a feud. That feud escalates further when the title character’s son Skarphedinn kills Thrain, brother of Kettle of the Mark, which leads to the involvement of Flosi Thordsson. The death of this work’s title character is followed by the story of Kari and Flosi’s reconciliation, and this work’s title character perishes with his grandson and wife after covering himself and them with an oxhide when Flosi’s men set his house on fire. For 10 points, identify this Icelandic saga, whose title character takes his titular epithet from his mode of death.

answer: The {Marriage} of {Heaven} and {Hell}

The narrator of this book journeys past Saturn with an angel to show him a house where chained monkeys tear off and devour each others’ limbs and a mill containing the skeletal body of Aristotle’s Analytics. Near the end of this book, the narrator describes seeing a figure in a flame of fire who tells an angel that Jesus “was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules,” causing the Angel to embrace the fire and arise as Elijah. It begins with the invocation “Rintrah roars & shakes his fires in the burden’d air; / Hungry clouds swag on the deep,” and includes a series of proverbs such as “the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.” This book claims “If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite,” and calls Milton “a true Poet and of the Devils party without knowing it.” This satire of the works of Swedenborg identifies the first title location with passivity and the second with energy. For 10 points, name this illuminated book by William Blake which reverses orthodox conceptions of the Christian afterlife.

answer: Empiricism and the {Philosophy} of {Mind}

One part of this work formulates an example involving the color of ties in a shop to draw a distinction between “X looks green to Jones” and “Jones sees that X is green;” that section is titled “The Logic of Looks.” The latter sections of this work deal with a theory invented by a hypothetical philosopher named Jones, according to which “overt utterances are… the culmination of a process which begins with… inner episodes.” This work argues that intentional categories are semantical categories in a section that hypothesizes a race of people speaking a language that deals only with public properties of public objects and is titled “Our Rylean Ancestors.” The main critique of this work targets the idea that knowledge is based on a foundation of non-inferential knowledge that is directly available to the mind. Based on set of lectures delivered in 1956, for 10 points, identify this long essay which attacks the “myth of the given,” the most famous work of Wilfrid Sellars.

answer: Tony Robert {Judt}

This writer conjectured that “Something is profoundly wrong with the way we live today,” in the opening of his last book, the title of which comes from Goldsmith’s The Deserted Village, Ill Fares the Land. Another of this writer’s books chronicles French intellectuals’ apologia for Stalinism in the years 1944-1956 and is titled Past Imperfect, while an introduction titled “The Misjudgment of Paris” opens this man’s book on “Blum, Camus, Aron, and the French Twentieth Century,” entitled The Burden of Responsibility. A former Zionist, this founder and director of NYU’s Remarque Institute would later become a critic of Israel, though he is perhaps best known for a historical work whose epilogue, “From the House of the Dead,” is a discussion of the European memory of the Holocaust. For 10 points, identify this recently deceased British historian, who authored a “History of Europe Since 1945,” entitled Postwar.

answer: Truman {desegregating} the {armed forces} [accept anything that mentions {desegregation} and the {military}; accept Executive Order {9981}; prompt on partial answer]

The genesis of this action lay partially in Robert Patterson’s establishment of the Gillem Board, which recommended that this action should be undertaken “at the earliest practicable moment.” This action was given further impetus by a killing that occurred in Monroe, Georgia, and Clark Clifford argued that this action would be part of a winning electoral strategy. Kenneth Royall was a skeptic of this action, arguing that it should be undertaken gradually, and its implementation was overseen by the Fahy Committee, which also recommended the elimination of a 10 percent quota. This action was carried out by a decree which created a President’s Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity, whose responsibilities included working with the Secretary of Defense; that decree was Executive Order 9981. For 10 points, identify this action which forbid discrimination in a certain American institution on the basis of “race, color, religion, or national origin,” carried out by FDR’s successor.

answer: {Edvard Grieg’s} piano concerto in {A minor} [prompt on partial answer]

Percy Grainger was renowned for his performance of this piece, and revised its orchestration in 1917 with the blessing of its composer. For many years, the second theme of this piece’s first movement was scored for trumpet instead of cellos thanks to a recommendation by Liszt. Its third and final movement is marked Allegro molto e marcato, and begins with a theme in two/four time inspired by a halling. Its first movement cadenza is modeled after the opening of Schumann’s piece in the same genre. That cadenza begins with a timpani roll before the main instrument plays a descending cascade of falling minor seconds followed by falling minor thirds. Written in 1868, it was its composer’s only concerto, and is in the key of A minor. For 10 points, name this concerto written by the composer of the Holberg Suite and “In the Hall of the Mountain King.”

At the end of this work, its author notes that he has been reluctant to cite authorities, preferring reasons to them, but nevertheless provides quotes from Aristotle and Boileau to support his position. While this work acknowledges the soundness of the arguments that use “the example of the ancients,” its author refuses to reply to them, adding that “we are constructing no system here… we are a historian, not a critic.” This work claims that “the age of the epic draws near its end,” before outlining how “Christianity leads poetry to the truth,” and argues that the perfect combination of the grotesque and the sublime is to be found in Shakespeare. This work opens by claiming that “the drama contained in the following pages has nothing to commend it to the… good will of the public,” and associates the grotesque with the new form of comedy, which this work claims is what distinguishes romantic from classical literature. For 10 points, identify this 1827 essay, a manifesto of the new French drama by Victor Hugo which was meant to precede Hugo’s play about a British Lord Protector.

According to Theosophist Anna Kingsford’s Clothed With the Sun, this phrase was uttered because its speaker had what Kingsford called an “Aeon,” or “double portion.” In his commentaries on the Psalms, John Calvin argued that this phrase, which opens Psalm 22, was composed by David “under the influence of the Spirit of prophecy,” alluding to the later recurrence of this phrase in religious literature. In two contexts, the utterance of this phrase leads some people to bring sponges filled with vinegar, and both of the texts which mention that event agree that just prior to the utterance of this phrase, there was darkness over the land from the sixth to the ninth hour. The utterance of this phrase is reported in both Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34, after which its speaker is said to “give up the ghost,” and in the standard harmonization this phrase, absent from both Luke and John, is the fourth of seven spoken in a certain context. Translating from the Aramaic “eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani,” for 10 points, identify this phrase, one of the seven sayings of Christ on the cross.

answer: {ferrocene}

A recent ruthenium-free Gratzl cell developed by Daeneke et al used this ion and its cation as the couple in place of the typical iodide/tri-iodide couple. While a cyanide compound is used in current second-generation glucometers, the original design relied upon the interaction between glucose oxidase and a derivative of this molecule. Keally, Pauson, and Miller published an incorrect “sigma” structure of this molecule, while Sidgwick’s rule was used to determine its correct pi structure by Woodward and Wilkinson. A common lab procedure for the Bronsted-Lowry-acid-catalyzed Friedel-Crafts acetylation of this compound relies on column chromatography to separate its orange monoacetylated form from its reddish diacetylated form. This superaromatic compound is a stronger nucleophile than benzene because six pi electrons are distributed over five carbon atoms on each of the two rings that form its sandwich structure. For 10 points, name this compound consisting of two cyclopentadienyl rings and an iron atom.

answer: {Vilnius} [or {Wilno} ; or {Vilna} ]

Owing to the mixed population of this city, a royal decree of 1536 established “Greek” and “Roman” parity for election to the position of magistrate here. This city was the site of a World War II battle in which Ivan Bagramyan and Ivan Chernyakovsky overwhelmed the Army Group Center which held this city under the command of Walter Model. In 1658, Russian troops under Yuri Dolgoroukov sacked this city after winning the battle of Werki. This city was home to a notable Jesuit college made into a full academy in 1578 by Stephen Bathory, and in 1919 this city, which lay just southeast of the Foch line, was the subject of a land claim by Poland. First established as a capital by the Grand Duke Gediminas, this city was the center of the Haskalah, or “Jewish Enlightenment,” movement, and was notable for its large Jewish community. For 10 points, identify this city sitting on the confluence of the Neris and its namesake river, the present-day capital of Lithuania.

answer: interstellar {dust} grains

In the presence of a magnetic field these objects can undergo Purcell alignment, a process that is independent of the ratio of their temperature to that of the surrounging medium, unlike their Davis-Greenstein alignment mechanism. The Serkowski relationship is an empirical fit for the wavelength-dependent polarization produced by these objects, which form in supernova ejecta and in winds around cool giant stars. Their continued growth in protostellar disks leads to high migration speeds at the meter-size barrier. They produce interstellar reddening along lines of sight in which they have not been efficiently destroyed in shocks through sputtering and shattering. For 10 points, silicates are a common component of what solid portion of the interstellar medium consisting of small grains?

One chapter in this work tells of how a man named Gobryas made an alliance with this work’s main character after the former’s king was slain by that character in battle. At one point in this work, it is argued to Chrysantas that “the best should have the preference both in honors and gifts,” but this work ends on a sour note, chiding a certain group for allowing rigor to die out while preserving effeminacy, as well as losing the art of chariot warfare. The subject of this work shows his mercy by releasing the wife of Tigranes, the king of Armenia and arranges an expedition to India, while in another section, that subject’s men are instructed that “courage is more likely to save men’s lives than running away,” following a battle against the Assyrians. This work’s second chapter begins with a recounting of the lineage of its subject, the son of Mandane and Cambyses, and this work goes on to tell how its main subject overthrew his grandfather Astyages to assume his most famous position. For 10 points, identify this quasi-fictional biography of the founder of the Persian Empire, a treatise on leadership written by Xenophon.

These figures appear on the closed panels of the Morrison triptych. Rubens painted these figures next to a horse in a painting whose menagerie of exotic animals was painted by Jan Brueghel. Most art critics believe that the central panel of The Garden of Earthly Delights depicts these figures in a cave at the bottom right. In an engraving by Durer, these figures are depicted with a cat, a rabbit, an ox, and an elk, which represent the four humors. The outside upper front panels of the Ghent Altarpiece depict these figures, who are pursued by a red-clad angel brandishing a giant sword as they walk into a deserted landscape in a painting by Masacchio.

Daiko Takahashi argued that this process occurs in Japanese as a type of long-distance scrambling, while James Huang argued that it occurs covertly in Logical Form in Chinese. When subjects undergo this process, it exhibits the Comp-trace effect. Constructions which do not allow it to occur include sentential subjects and coordinate structures, and are called islands. The left-branch condition on it often leads to it being accompanied by pied piping. Languages in which it does not occur are referred to as having the namesake words in situ. The fact that this process leaves a trace is shown by the fact that wanna contraction is blocked in sentences such as “Who do you want to win the race?” The words which this process is named after start out as complements or adjuncts of the verb, and then move to the beginning of the sentence. For 10 points, name this process in which declarative sentences are turned into questions through a certain movement.
