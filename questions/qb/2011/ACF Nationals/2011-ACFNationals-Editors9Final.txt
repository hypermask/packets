answer: {completeness}

A nonempty metric space X with this property cannot be decomposed into a sequence of dense, open, and disjoint subsets of X according to Baire’s category theorem. In logic, a criterion formulated by Post holds that a deductive theory has this property if adding an elementary statement to it which is not an elementary theorem renders the system inconsistent. The converse of this property in logic is called “soundness,” and is equivalent to saying that if a system F implies a sentence G, then G can be proved in F. A metric space has this property if every Cauchy sequence within that space is convergent, and in graph theory, this term is applied to graphs in which each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. For 10 points, identify this term which is also used to describe decision problems which are contained in the intersection of NP and NP-hard.

answer: {Neo-Liberalism}

One member of this school of thought wrote Standing Guard, a book about how foreign investors protected their overseas capital in the 19th and 20th centuries. That author, Charles Lipson, is better known for writing Reliable Partners. Another member of this school of thought is Andrew Moravcsik, the author of Choice for Europe, this group’s most notable work on European integration. Foundational to this school of thought is the idea of seeking absolute rather than relative gains. Prominent books in this school include After Hegemony, written by Robert Keohane, as well as a book on “soft power” by Joseph Nye. This rationalist school’s most notable concept was first proposed by Immanuel Kant, and holds that trade and elections make war less likely.

answer: {New York draft} riot

The last day of this event saw newspaper editor James Brooks publish an article purporting to be a history of this event. One faction active during this event was the Black Joke Engine Company, whose members were led at one point during this event by local politician Peter Masterson. This event effectively ended the re-election chances of Mayor George Opdyke, and included raids on the homes of James and Abby Gibbons, who had previously aroused local resentment with their celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation. One grievance of those participating in this event was the ability to of some individuals to obtain $300 waiver, and this event took on racial dimensions as white mobs murdered multiple blacks and damaged institutions like the Colored Orphans Asylum. Eventually quelled by the arrival of the 7th Regiment from Gettysburgh, for ten points, identify this July, 1863 outbreak of violence occurring in protest of the Conscription Act in a certain American city.

answer: Richard {Cobden}

One of this individual’s publications was a pamphlet that drew parallels between the two title years in an attempt to urge against a war with France; that pamphlet was titled 1793 and 1853, in Three Letters. A notable supporter of the Union during the American Civil War, this close correspondent of Charles Sumner penned pamphlets titled England, Ireland, and America and Russia, which advocated against a foreign policy based on the balance of power. In 1857, this politician lost his Parliamentary seat for the West Riding of Yorkshire for criticizing Palmerston’s China policy, and one of this man’s last significant actions was the negotiation of a commercial treaty with France which included a novel “most favored nation” clause. This man’s most famous achievement was brought about by direct confrontation with Robert Peel, and was advocated by a group this man co-founded with John Bright. For 10 points, identify this British politician and member of the Manchester School, a noted advocate of free trade and leader of the Anti-Corn Law League.

answer: George {Enescu}

In one of his concerts, this composer seemingly gave into an anti-Semitic crowd by choosing not to play a piece by Ernest Bloch, only to play Maurice Ravel’s Kaddish instead. This composer indicated saltando bowing to imitate the sound of a cricket and used high-pitched trills to represent a bird in a cage in two of his ten Impressions d’Enfance. One of his pieces begins with the oboes and clarinets alternately playing the melody of the drinking song “I Have a Coin, and I Want a Drink,” and later quotes the folk tune Ciocarlia. His collaboration with Merri Franquin led him to compose Legende, a mainstay of the modern trumpet repertoire. This composer included a wind machine in the score of his symphonic poem about a storm at sea, Vox maris. The teacher of Yehudi Menuhin, he spent over twenty years writing an opera about the entire life of Oedipus. For 10 points, name this violin virtuoso who composed the opera Oedipe and paid homage to the music of his home country in his two Romanian Rhapsodies.

answer: {matter-antimatter asymmetry} [accept any answer that mentions either the {deficiency} of {antimatter} or the {excess} of {matter} in the {known universe} ]

The D-Zero experiment recently published results in which the dimuon decay in B-mesons was used to find evidence of this phenomenon. In the thermal leptogenesis model of Fukugita and Yanagida, the degree of this phenomenon is proportional to the degree of CP violation as calculated from the neutrino masses. The baryogenesis mechanism of Affleck and Dine generates this phenomenon via the oscillation of scalar fields, and if this phenomenon held only locally, the boundaries between domains where it did and did not hold would be detectable via gamma radiation, according to the CDRG theory. In order to provide a model of baryogenesis, Sakharov posited baryon number violation, thermal disequilibrium, and CP violation to explain the existence of this phenomenon. For 10 points, identify this phenomenon in which positive energy baryons dominate over negative energy ones, rather than equal amounts existing and annihilating completely into photons.

answer: {kohen} or {kohanim} [prompt on {Jewish priests} before the end; prompt on {Levites} before mentioned]

Frank Moore Cross attempted a reconstruction of this group’s lineage over the course of 800 years, and Julius Wellhausen used the information contained in Chronicles to further constrain the time during which this group’s traditions originated. According to Nehemiah, these people worked in one-week shifts, while Exodus dictated that these people wore a tunic decorated with twelve jewels and two stones. In one tradition, a high administrative official within this group had the title of ha-segan, while Kings repeatedly refers to leaders of this group as ha-gadol, and members of this group made use of oracular objects called “Urim” and “Thummim,” which were sewn into their efod. The lineage of this group is held to originate with an investiture ceremony described in Exodus, Numbers, and Leviticus, with passages in Numbers describing the transfer of authority to Eleazar. Traditionally held to have originated with Moses’ brother Aaron, for 10 points, identify this group, a subset of the Levites who made up the Jewish priesthood.

answer: {hyperglycemia} or {high} blood {sugar} (accept “{diabetes}” {up} until “{dawn}” is read; prompt on it after “{dawn effect}” {up} until “{physiological condition}”; {don’t} accept it after “{physiological condition”}){.}

Kallikrein mediates the effects of this condition upon hematoma expansion after intracranial hemorrhage. The dawn phenomenon is an example of this condition, while a reaction producing this effect is the Somyogi phenomenon. This physiological condition upregulates fibronectin expression, causing basement membrane thickening in capillaries, and the mucal cells of the retina are also damaged by this condition. Prolonged episodes of this phenomenon result in the accumulation of AGEs (A-G-Es) and Amadori products through non-enzymatic glycosylation. Along with somatostatin secretion, this symptom downregulates growth hormone secretion. Persistent cases of this symptom also cause cells to shift to the polyol metabolic pathway, increasing intracellular concentrations of sorbitol and fructose. Along with ketoacidosis, this symptom is a hallmark of type I diabetes. For 10 points, name this condition in which an individual’s blood contains excess glucose.

An analog of this figure from another myth system is Khan Boghu, who dies when the hero Badikan kills seven birds, and this figure often casts a spell that is only reversed by a self-playing lute. In some accounts, this figure was described as the brother of a dragon that guarded the Water of Life and Death and owned either a three-legged or a seven-legged horse; overcoming him involves winning a horse race against him. In the most famous story about this figure, he is tricked by a girl he kidnaps into revealing the hiding place of his most valuable possession, which turns out to be neither inside a broom nor inside of a goat. One story of this figure’s demise tells of how he was vanquished by Bulat the Brave and Ivan, who killed this figure for kidnapping Vasilissa, and in most tales, he is overcome by locating an egg inside of a duck inside of a rabbit and breaking that egg. Sometimes seen as the male counterpart to Baba Yaga, for 10 points, identify this antagonist from Slavic myth whose epithet comes from the fact that his soul is not contained in his body but rather in the aforementioned egg.
