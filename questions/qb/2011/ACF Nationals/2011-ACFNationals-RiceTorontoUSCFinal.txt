answer: {Franco}-{Spanish} War [Prompt on {30 Year's War}; accept anything that mentions {France} and {Spain}]

The winning commander of this war captured the fortresses of St. Ghislain and Landrecies and managed to escape being surrounded by his rival at Valenciennes. England gained Dunkirk during this war after Don Juan of Austria was defeated at another battle that also saw a major defeat of a defector from the winning side. The treaty that ended this war was signed on Pheasant Island in the presence of Don Luis De Haro while a major battle in this war saw the defeat of Francisco de Melo and the tercio formation. The most important commander of the losing side in this war defected during the Fronde and would be finally defeated at the Battle of the Dunes by the Vicomte de Turenne. That general was the Prince de Conde. For 10 points, name this decade-long continuation of the 30 Years' War that saw the Battle of Rocroi and was ended with the Peace of the Pyrenees.

answer: {Herero} Genocide

This event and a history of it written by Peter Fraenk was mentioned in the 1985 United Nation's Whitaker Report, which led to a public meeting with Munjuku Nguvauva. This event was preceded and largely inspired by a revolt led by Hendrik Witbooi. Many of the people involved in this event helped to build the Otavi railroad line and Samuel Leutwin attempted to prevent it. Victims of this event were held at the camp on Shark Island, a facility that was visited by individuals like Theodore Mollison and Eugen Fischer, who injected prisoner with typhoid and polio. This event was spurred on by the target group's defeat at the Battle of Waterberg when its victims were driven into the Omaheke desert, the wells of which were likely poisoned by the German Schutztruppe. FTP name this action executed primarily by the army of Lothar von Trotha, the first genocide of the 20th century, that targeted a major ethnic group of Namibia.

answer: {“Thyrsis”}

This poem describes the coming of “Midsummer” by cataloging the flowers that will bloom, including the “musk carnations” and the “gold-dusted snapdragons.” Another of its sections describes the ability of a flute player to “make leap up with joy the beauteous head/ of Proserpine” so that she recalls the Dorian fields she left behind. Its speaker laments that his visits now are rare and that his own “pipe is lost,” before declaring “alack, for Corydon, no rival now.” Throughout this poem, the speaker mentions such landmarks as “Wytham Flats” and “Childsworth Farm,” both located near Oxford where the title character once roamed. First published in MacMillan’s Magazine in 1866, it begins with the line “How changed is here each spot man makes or fills,” and was dedicated to the author of such poems as “Say Not the Struggle Nought Availeth.” For 10 points, name this monody written to commemorate Arthur Hugh Clough, a work by Matthew Arnold.

answer: {Jahn-Teller} effect [or theorem; or distortion]

Recent investigations of this effect have concerned cooperative variants in crystals and its relation to fullerenes and other icosahederal systems. Generating an avoided crossing, the pseudo version occurs in fluxional molecules and manifests in stereochemical non-rigidity of molecules and ions. One way to explain this effect mathematically involves the odd terms in the vibronic perturbation expansion. Experimental demonstration of this phenomenon is observed in UV-VIS absorbance spectra as split bands. Another important property of this theorem is its failure to predict directionality, which explains the shortening of z-axis ligands. The most paradigmatic example is in the form of six-coordinate copper (II ) complexes with three electrons in the two e-sub-g orbitals. For 10 points, name this doubly-eponymous theorem that describes the geometrical distortion of non-linear molecules with degenerate electronic ground states to lower the overall energy and symmetry of the complex.

answer: The {Best Years} of {Our Lives}

One character in this movie gives a loan to Mr. Novak without collateral, and later gives a drunken speech where he defends collateral-free loans as “gambling on the future of this country.” In one of its many deep-focus shots, one of its main characters discovers his ability to play “Chopsticks” while its third main character painfully breaks off a relationship in a phone booth in Butch’s bar. Near the end of this film, an unemployed soda jerk visits an aircraft graveyard before accepting a construction job and returning to Boone City, where he reunites with Peggy. Harold Russell won an unprecedented two Oscars for playing a character in this movie who initially refuses to marry Wilma Cameron because of the loss of his hands. It focuses on the troubles Al Stephenson, Homer Parrish, and Fred Derry have reintegrating themselves into domestic life. For 10 points, name this 1946 film directed by William Wyler about the struggles of three veterans returning home from World War II.

answer: {Asheville}

The Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino is buried in this city at the Basilica of St. Lawrence, a building he designed, and this city is the location of the annual Bele Chere festival. A hotel on Sunset Mountain in this city, the Grove Park Inn, is a notable example of Arts and Crafts design. Willem de Kooning created a painting named for this city while teaching at nearby Black Mountain College. A residence designed by Richard Morris Hunt with landscaping by Frederick Law Olmsted is located at George Vanderbilt's massive Biltmore Estate in this city. This city is located at the confluence of the Swannanoa and French Broad rivers and is located off the Blue Ridge Parkway. For 10 points, name this North Carolina city that is the location of Thomas Wolfe Auditorium.

answer: {Civil Rights} Act of {1964}

One restrictive implementation of this concept by a federal court was allowed to stand when the Supreme Court refused to accept the appeal in Hopwood v. Texas. One Supreme Court case centrally involving this concept, Johnson v. Transportation Agency of Santa Clara County, saw the scope of this concept greatly expanded. In another case involving this concept, the Supreme Court rejected the logic of “business necessity,” and allowed the implementation of this concept on the basis of statistical evidence. That case was Griggs v. Duke Power Company, and legislation implementing this policy includes the 1972 extension of Title VII, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. For ten points, identify this policy which took its name from Kennedy’s Executive Order 10925, which was meant to ensure that “applicants are employed without regard to race,” and whose constitutionality was upheld in the 1978 case of Bakke v. UC Regents.

answer: The {Notebooks} of {Malte Laurids Brigge} or {Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge}

One episode in this work takes place in the Bibliotheque National, where the narrator sits reading an unspecified poet and wonders what the beggars who “know that I am really one of themselves,” want with him. The narrator admits that at 28, he has written only a bad study of Carpaccio and a drama titled “Marriage,” and in another episode the title character imagines that people have several faces which they wear throughout their lives. Interspersed throughout this work are recollections of “Maman,” and the dead Ingeborg, as well as of Maman’s sister Abelone, and one scene in this novel recalls the death of the chamberlain Christoph Detlev at Ulsgaard. References abound in this work to various women poets, including Mariana Alcoforado and Gaspara Stampa, as well as to the author’s other works like the Sonnets to Orpheus. Written in the form of episodic reminiscences by the title character, for ten points, identify this novel by Rainer Maria Rilke.

answer: {Carmichael} numbers (prompt on {pseudoprime} or {Fermat pseudoprime} , but accept {absolute Fermat pseudoprime} )

Alford, Granville and Pomerance showed that there are an infinite number of these entities in a paper dedicated to Paul Erdos on his 80th birthday, and they also showed that there are approximately n to the power of two-sevenths of them between 1 and n. They are a subclass of Knodel numbers with n equals 1. If an integer n is square-free, and if all its prime divisors p have the property that p minus 1 divides n minus 1, n is necessarily one of these numbers; that test is known as Korselt’s criterion. 561 is the first of these numbers, which manage to pass the Fermat primality test without being prime. For 10 points name these numbers n satisfying the congruence b to the n minus 1 similar to 1 (mod n) for all integers b which are relatively prime to n, named for an American mathematician.
