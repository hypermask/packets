answer: {integrable} [or {integrability} ]

According to Holder’s inequality, the product of two functions from the Banach-normed spaces L-sub-p and L-sub-q has this property if p and q are conjugate indices. A weak form of this property is present for a function if that function is bounded and its set of discontinuity points is a zero set, and that version of this property is absent for the characteristic function of the rationals. If a sequence of functions converges everywhere to a real-valued measurable function f and each function in the sequence is absolutely bounded by a function with this property, then f has this property as well, according to Lebesgue’s Dominated Convergence theorem. A function can also be said to have the proper form of this property with respect to the Jordan measure if the limit of its Riemann sum is finite. For ten points, identify this property possessed by those functions whose anti-derivative can be computed.

answer: {Italian Concerto} [or {BWV} 971; or {Concerto} After the {Italian Taste} ; or {Concerto nach Italienischem Gusto} ]

This piece was called a “perfect model” of its genre in a criticism of the supposed “turgidity” of its composer’s other works written by Johann Adolph Scheibe. It was published as the first half of a collection that also includes a piece which concludes with an eighth movement Echo. The first and third movements of this piece are F major ritornellos, framing its D minor arioso movement. Besides the piece it was published with, it is the only single piece of its composer’s to require a contrasting forte and piano two-manual harpsichord. Its composer’s reinterpretation of works in the same form by Antonio Vivaldi, it was published as part of the Clavier-Übung II along with its composer’s French Overture. For 10 points, name this harpsichord piece influenced by the music of the title country, written by J.S. Bach.

answer: Thomas {Schelling}

This thinker criticized Becker and Murphy’s argument that drug addiction is rational by claiming that addictive behavior results from people losing struggles against self-control in his article “The Intimate Contest for Self-Command.” This thinker modeled a traffic jam to show how aggregate behavior results from individuals not caring about the effects of their actions on others in Micromotives and Macrobehavior. He placed pennies and nickels on a board and randomly moved the ones adjacent to coins of the same color to demonstrate how minor racial preferences could still result in fully segregated neighborhoods. This thinker visualized arms races as a “competitive dialogue,” and showed that two people simply told to meet somewhere in New York City would likely go to places such as Grand Central Station to explain his theory of focal points. For 10 points, name this author of Arms and Influence and The Strategy of Conflict, whose application of game theory to nuclear war helped win him the 2005 Nobel Prize in Economics.

answer: Abraham {Lincoln's house divided} speech

A response to this speech criticizes it for preaching a "doctrine of uniformity," and declares that "this Government was made on the white basis...for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever." This speech repeatedly mocks a senator's policy of "care not," and contrasts his stated indifference with those who "do care for the result." It uses the metaphor of "a lot of framed timbers" crafted by different workmen, which "exactly matte the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting," to describe a conspiracy planned by "Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James." This speech begins "If we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could then better judge what to do, and how to do it," and claims that the Dred Scott decision is a culmination of a plot to legalize slavery in all states. The focus of a debate held later that year at Ottawa, it declares "this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free.” For 10 points, name this speech by Abraham Lincoln which warns that the United States, like the title building, "cannot stand."

answer: David {Hockney}

This artist’s photo collages include one of Joshua Trees in the California Desert, Pearblossom Highway. He included a totem pole in a painting of a man in a tuxedo and a woman in pink standing perpendicular to each other, and also painted a series of works about his two dachshunds entitled Dog Days. This artist argued that many Renaissance painters used optical devices such as a camera obscura to achieve realistic effects in his book Secret Knowledge. He depicted places in East Yorkshire in his paintings Woldgate Woods and Garrowby Hill, and painted a double portrait of a man in green sitting with a white cat on his lap and a standing woman in a purple dress on either side of an open window. Another of his paintings shows a diving board and a pool with a small amount of water in the air indicating that a swimmer has just dived underwater. For 10 points, name this 20th century British painter of Mr. and Mrs. Clark and Percy and A Bigger Splash.

answer: John {Crowe Ransom}

One of this author’s poems uses enjambment between two stanzas to communicate “but how exceedingly/and purply did the knot/Swell with the venom.” Another of his poems sees a “lady young in beauty waiting” who spurns an admirer who addresses himself as “a gentleman in a dustcoat trying.” This poet wrote about “Old Chucky,” a hen who is stung to death by a “transmogrifying bee” and is imagined by her owner to be in a long sleep. This author of “Piazza Piece” wrote about “one house” in which we are “sternly stopped” in a poem that conveys how the title character’s “brown study Astonishes us all.” This author of “Janet Waking” humorously recounted how the title character “with rod” made the geese “rise/From their noon apple-dreams and scuttle/Goose-fashion under the skies” in a poem which opens “There was such speed in her little body, And such lightness in her footfall.” For 10 points, name this Fugitive poet of “Bells for John Whiteside’s Daughter.”

answer: {adiabatic} [or {isentropic}]

Lieb and Yngvason provided a definition of this type of process by using an ordering relation and relating this type of process to the raising or lowering of a weight; that definition builds on one by Caratheodory, which defined this kind of transformation in terms of accessibility. A theorem of this name states that no transition will occur at a Landau-Zener velocity of zero and defines the namesake kind of transition to be from an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian to a corresponding eigenstate in the final. The magnetocaloric effect dictates that temperature can be changed by varying the magnetic field under a condition described by this adjective. Both the quantum number and entropy bear a property named for this adjective because they stay constant under slow change under a namesake “invariance theorem.” The ration of heat capacity at constant pressure to the heat capacity at constant volume is known as this kind of index, and this term describes two processes that accompany isothermic processes in the Carnot cycle. For 10 points, identify this term referring to a process that occurs without heat transfer.

answer: {Murray}-{Darling} River System [prompt on either, but {only} accept {both}]

Movement of the Cadell Fault 25,000 years ago caused one part of this river system to flood low-lying adjacent areas, creating the Barmah wetlands, home to a unique species of red gum trees. This river system contains an unusual eel-tailed catfish and the oldest extant fish traps in the world are located upstream on this river system at Brewarrina. High levels of iron sulfide in the lower course of this river system oxidize when exposed to air during droughts causing acidity levels of below 2 pH in some parts. One part of this system arises from the confluence of the Culgoa and Barwon Rivers and flows across its namesake “Downs” before meeting the other part at Wentworth. A complex system of barrages has been constructed to prevent the influx of seawater from the Coorong Lagoon as its flows into Lake Alexandria near Swan Hill and it is bordered on its west by the Lake Eyre basin. Edwards Crossing was the first bridge over this river system as it flows along the border between Victoria and New South Wales and it provides up to 40% of the freshwater to Adelaide. For 10 points, identify this vast river system of Australia, the combination of its two longest rivers.

answer: {Hyderabad} [accept “ {Osmanistan} ” before mention]

The military leadership of this polity was dominated by a group known as “St. George’s Old Boys,” and Sidney Cotton provided arms to this polity. This polity’s leader was the target of an assassination attempt by Arman Paraj, and its case was still pending at the UN Security Council when it was overrun, though its ruler attempted to set up a government-in-exile at Karachi. The Telangana Rebellion took place concurrently with the downfall of this polity, and this majority-Hindu polity employed a Muslim quasi-militia known as the Razakars. Advised not to resist by its own armed forces commander, General El Edroos, this polity was defeated by Sardar Patel in Operation Polo, which saw the surrender of Osman Ali Khan and the incorporation of this polity into much of Bombay State. For 10 points, identify this kingdom in the Deccan Plateau that was absorbed after a short 1948 war into India.

answer: {halakha}

The “analytic” approach to studying this concept was advocated in a work entitled Ends of the breastplate. The literature associated with this concept usually takes the form of monograph codes, commentaries, and responsa, the latter of which is an attempt to interpret this concept in relation to current problems and includes such works as a book called The Lion’s Roar. The “enactments” written as a result of applying this concept are called taqqanot, while decrees issued pursuant to this concept are called gezerot. The development of this concept was initiated by the “splendid ones,” or ge’onim, who were supplanted by ri’shonim such as Shelomoh Yitzhaki, or Rashi. Modern codification of this concept was undertaken by Yosef Karo with the publication of the Shulchan arukh, while the major geonic codification of it is the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides. For ten points, identify this religious code with scriptural and rabbinical components, the body of Jewish law.

Henry Moore sculpted Large Figure in a Shelter for a memorial at this location, which also contains an Eduardo Chillida concrete sculpture with a hole in its center known as Our Father’s House. In reaction to an event at this place, French sculptor René Iché used his six year old daughter to sculpt a work depicting a girl with the head of a skull. Rene Magritte’s painting Le Drapeau Noir is often seen by critics as a response to that event at this location, which caused F. E. McWilliam to sculpt a mask of Neville Chamberlain in protest. A work depicting this location was accompanied by a poem by Paul Eluard at the Paris International Exhibition, and was vandalized by Tony Shafrazi, who spray-painted it with the worlds KILL LIES ALL. That painting contains a ghostly arm holding a candle and a blazing light bulb above a screaming horse’s head. For 10 points, name this location bombed by the Condor Legion, an action protested in a black and white painting by Pablo Picasso.

answer: {JNK} ({pronounced} “{junk}”) or c-Jun {N}-{terminal kinases} (prompt on {Jun kinases}, I guess)

These proteins can be activated by the JIP1 complex through MLK3, although the complex suppresses this protein’s signaling through other pathways. In experiments involving Drosophila, scientists knocked out MKK4, an activator of these proteins, which led to early embryonic death of the flies. Cytokine stress activates MKK4 and MKK7, which in turn activates this group of proteins. The neuronal form of these proteins is required for apoptosis and the activation of dimeric complexes known as AP-1 transcription factors. In the G2 phase of the cell cycle, these proteins phosphorylates Cdc25c, regulating Cdk-1 activation. An article by Xia et al discovered that apoptosis requires the concurrent activation of p38 and these proteins and the inhibition of ERK. This group of ten enzymes are formed from the alternative splicing of three genes. For 10 points, name these proteins in the MAP kinase pathway that bind and phosphorylate c-fos and c-Jun.

The Earl of Derby left this man’s party due to disagreements with this man over the redirection of the Protestant Church of Ireland’s wealth to the native Catholic population. This man’s first Prime Ministership saw the establishment of a 10-hour work day as well as a national board of public health, and he left politics for four years because of a disagreement over foreign policy and war conduct. This politician’s most famous achievement was introduced by him three times in the House of Commons, passing only when Charles Grey threatened to create 50 new peers in the House of Lords, and carried out an overhaul of the election system, including the elimination of rotten boroughs. For ten points, identify this British Politician who succeded Peel as Prime Minister and as a member of Parliament helped engineer the passage of 1832 Reform Act.

answer: The {Theory} of {Moral Sentiments}

One chapter of this work claims that without some “insignificant ornament” such as a “haunch button,” a suit of clothes is in want of something. That chapter cites the customs of cranial deformation among Native Americans and foot-binding among the Chinese to define the influence of “custom” and “fashion” on the subject of this work. The author of this work argues that it would be wrong for men to not treat women with “pleasantry, and attention” in a discussion of sex as one of the “passions which take their origins from the body,” as opposed to the social, unsocial, and selfish passions. The second of this work’s six parts discusses “merit and demerit,” whereas the opening portion describes human judgment with respect to adversity and propriety. Extensively discussing the “sympathy” that has men rejoice in the joys of others and feel sorrow at others’ sorrows, this work elucidates the “nature” and “motive” of morality, splitting from its author’s mentor at the University of Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson.

During both in medieval times and during this city’s time as a “commune,” it was ruled by a piccolo and gran consiglio of 25 and 50 members respectively. Soon afterwards, this city split from a “littoral” region to form the Corpus Separatum after being given up on by Maria Theresa. The Whitehead Torpedo Works and the Adria Navigation Company were two industries built in this city by its modernizer, Giovanni de Ciotta. During another independent stint, this city elected a member of the Autonomist party, Riccardo Zanella. The Istrian Exodus was precipitated by Yugoslav soldiers expelling around 60,000 Italians from this city and its environs. Earlier, this city was embroiled in a debate that Woodrow Wilson intervened in, calling for this city to be autonomous and to be home to the League of Nations. That was after the fascist Regency of Carnaro took this city over for several months and called it a “Free State,” led by Gabriele d’Annunzio. For 10 points, identify this port in Croatia.

Some forms of this method sometimes overestimate the electronic dielectric constant because the exchange-correlation energy’s polarization dependence. A common approximation in this model locally substitutes the exchange-correlation energy density of an inhomogenous system by that of an electron gas evaluated at the local density. One theorem central to this computing method states that the ground state properties of a many electron system can be determined by an electron density that depends on only three spatial coordinates, while another theorem used in this method states that the lowest energy corresponds to the true ground state density. An early version of this method relied on describing the wave function as a Slater determinant, while modern versions of this method rely on the two Hohenburg-Kohn theorems. Preceded by the Hartree-Fock and Thomas-Fermi formalisms, For 10 points, name this quantum mechanical method that calculates the ground state of many-bodied systems.
