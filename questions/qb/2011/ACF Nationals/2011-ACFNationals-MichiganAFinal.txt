One organization formed to fight this group ended up killing innocent partygoers mistaken for members of this group in the Barrios Altos massacre. This organization also fought the Committees of Self Defense or rondas. This organization killed 69 peasants to prove that they were a “hard nut to crack” and assassinated community activist Maria Moyala resulting in public defamation. In addition to perpetrating the Lucanamarca massacre, this group also detonated a bomb on Tatara Street, leading to international uproar. This organization took its name from a saying about Marxism-Leninism attributed to Jose Carlos Mariategui, and was originally led by a former philosophy professor under the pseudonym “Presidente Gonzalo” whose real name was Abimael Guzman. Mostly defeated due to the efforts of Alberto Fujimori, for 10 points, name this Maoist rebel group in Peru.

answer: Treatise on the {Emendation} of the {Intellect} or Treatise on the {Improvement} of the {Understanding}

The last section of this work is dedicated to the definition of its titular subject and includes eight of its properties, including one that states that "the more ideas express perfection of any object, the more perfect are they themselves." After giving the example of solving a problem of ratios and noting that mathematicians see the solution "not by virtue of Euclid's proposition, but intuitively, without going through any process," this work enumerates four "means for attaining our end." This work acknowledges that "one may take any view one likes of the imagination so long as one acknowledges that it is different" from the titular action, and towards the end of this work, the author contrasts the "series of fixed and eternal things" against the series of singular, changeable things. Probably the earliest of its authors compositions, it was first published in his Opera posthuma and since it is unfinished, this work simply concludes with the statement, "the rest of the treatise is wanting." For 10 points, identify this work by Baruch Spinoza, the aim of which is to better the way we comprehend things.

answer: {total internal} reflection [accept {Goos-Hanchen effect} before mention; accept {TIR} ; prompt on partial answers]

A quantum analogue of this effect was discovered to cause different time delays resulting in slightly different positions after passing a potential well in spinor neutrons by de Haan, et al in 2010. When polarized light undergoes this effect, light shifts perpendicular to the direction of propagation and the occurrence of this effect results in imaginary values in the coefficients derived from Fresnel’s formulas. Near field standing waves that form after undergoing this effect decay exponentially as they are not allowed to transport energy. Those waves are called evanescent waves, which can be coupled in the frustrated form of this effect that is analogous to quantum tunneling. The value above, which this effect will occur is given by the arcsine of the ratio of the indices of refraction of the media between which light undergoing this effect is passing. The operational principle behind optical fibers, for 10 points, name this effect that occurs when light strikes a boundary past the critical angle that causes complete reflection.

answer: {gap junctions}

A disease, which causes misformed fingers and teeth, called oculodentodigital dysplasia, is caused by a mutation in a protein found in these structures. Formation of these structures can be inhibited by phosphorylating Cx43. The “kiss of life” and “good Samaritan” effects are forms of the bystander effect mediated by these structures. Exposing cells to thapsigargin, which causes the release of large amounts of calcium ions, causes these structures to close. Cardiac and smooth muscle contain many of these structures, but they are not found in skeletal muscle, and these structures are found at electrical synapses. These structures form from the combination of two hemichannels, each of which is composed of six connexin proteins. For 10 points, name these structures, which allow movement of small molecules and ions to pass from one cell to another.

A book by this psychologist claims that multiple goals must be available in order for a video game to establish a strong reinforcement complex. This author of Mind at Play collaborated with Camille Wortman on a critique of Bandura’s Bobo Doll experiment. Diana Napolis repeatedly harassed this psychologist for supposedly helping to cover up a vast Satanist conspiracy. An experiment by this psychologist and Joyce Palmer asked subjects the same question with different verbs such as “hit,” “collided,” and “smashed,” and found that hearing more forceful verbs caused subjects to include images of broken glass in their descriptions of a car crash. A similar experiment by this psychologist found that subjects used their imaginations to provide details of an invented memory of being lost in a mall. For 10 points, name this psychologist whose research that false memories are easily constructed often brings her to testify against people who claim to have recovered memories of traumatizing childhood events.

answer: {methyl} group

Jensen and Jernelov discovered the biologically catalyzed transfer of this group to mercury, a reaction that can also be catalyzed abiotically by fulvic acid. Acidic fragmentation is followed by addition of this group, sometimes via the Haworth method, in a technique for determining the monosaccharide linkage patterns. In one reaction involving the transfer of this functional group, the C6 carbon of the substrate is attached by a cysteine thiolate, activating the C5 carbon as a resonance-stabilized carbanion that attacks the donor of this group; that reaction is catalyzed by thymidlyate synthase. Kuhn-Roth oxidation can be used to determine the number of these groups attached to a carbon atom. In vivo, S-adenosylmethionine is a common donor of this functional group. For 10 points, name this functional group which, when added to benzene, produces toluene.

answer: {Lawrence} , Kansas

Tensions in this city were heightened by Franklin Coleman’s murder of Charles Dow, an event that led to an armed standoff between political factions in this city. This city was the stronghold of a political faction led by natives Carmi Babcock and George Dietzler, who adjourned a legislative body to this city for several years running to work on the constitution. This city was home to an action that occurred when Samuel Jones, a local sheriff, took over control of a posse of over 700 men from a U.S. marshal and joined up with David Atchison to direct a mob to burn the Emigrant Aid Company’s Free State Hotel. As a reaction to that event in this city, John Brown and his associated massacred pro-slavery settlers at Pottawatomie, and this city was also home to a notorious Civil War massacre perpetuated by raiders under William Quantrill. For 10 points, identify this town in which the aforementioned burning of abolitionist settlements gave the Republican Party its cry of “Bleeding Kansas.”

The scholarly study of this movement dates back to Johann Lorenz von Mosheim, who postulated a theory of this movement’s spread in his work “Institutiones christianae maiores.” The doctrines of this movement were attacked in the work Adversus Haereses by the Bishop Irenaeus, and Gerschom Scholem linked one branch of this movement to the merkavah, or “chariot” on which God is said to sit in Ezekiel 1:26. Leaders of major groups of this religious movement included Basilides and the poet Valentinus, and one scholar of this movement hypothesized that it may have had its origins in the thought of St. Paul, whose supposed letter was one of a set of documents discovered along with the Apocryphon of James and the Gospel of Truth in a cache at Nag Hammadi. The figure of Sophia, or “wisdom,” played a prominent role in this religious movement, which was the subject of a treatise by Elaine Pagels. For 10 points, identify this religious movement which produced works like the Gospel of Thomas and Gospel of Judas and believed in an imperfect demiurge, whose name comes from the Greek for “knowledge.”

Under this leader’s government, the Osthilfe or Eastern Aid was organized to help farmers. He was heavily influenced by a camarilla that included his son, and a plan for him to institute martial law fell apart after war games supposedly showed that he would be unable to control his country. This leader succeeded Friedrich Ebert in his highest position and would retain that position at the end of his first term thanks to the support of the Catholic Center Party. Despite that support, this leader was persuaded to dismiss Heinrich Bruning by the intrigues of Kurt von Schleicher. Later, this leader used Article 48 of his Constitution to assume a “Silent Dictatorship,” and promulgate the Enabling Act. Prior to his political career, this man led the Eighth Army to victory over Paul von Rennenkampf at the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes with the help of Erich Ludendorff.

For economic purposes, the optimal value for this quantity can be estimated by multiplying the flow rate, raised to a fractional power, by either density or viscosity, depending on the flow regime, also raised to a fractional power. The effective surface roughness is often divided by this quantity in equations for calculating the friction factor such as the Colebrook and White equation. The pressure drop is inversely related to this quantity raised to the fourth power for laminar flow through a cylindrical pipe as related by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. Frictional dissipation is inversely proportional to this quantity, and it is often given in “nominal” values. This quantity is multiplied by the fluid velocity and density and divided by viscosity to calculate the dimensionless Reynolds number. For 10 points name this quantity which, when squared and multiplied by pi times the fluid velocity is proportional to the volumetric flow rate.
