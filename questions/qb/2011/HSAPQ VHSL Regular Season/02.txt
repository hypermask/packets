A constant named for these substances appears in the Henderson-Hasselbalch (HOSS-el-bock) equation. That constant, their namesake "dissociation constant," measures their strength in solution. Lewis defined them as electron pair acceptors, while Bronsted and Lowry defined them as proton donors, contrasting them with proton receivers, or bases. For 10 points, name these substances which have a pH of less than seven.

answer: {springs} [prompt on {simple harmonic oscillators}]

Like capacitors, when these objects are placed in parallel, their effective namesake constant becomes equal to the addition of the two individual values of those constants. The angular frequency of a weight connected to one of these objects is given by taking the square root of that constant over the mass. That constant for these objects also shows up in a law that relates the displacement of an object to the restoring force. For 10 points, Hooke's Law problems are often given in the context of a mass on one of what elastic objects?

answer: {unemployment} rate

According to many economists, a factor in controlling inflation is avoiding attempts to drop this other quantity below its "natural" level. Its types include "frictional," "cyclical," and "structural." The Phillips Curve posits an inverse correlation between this quantity and inflation, which was discredited by the "stagflation" phenomenon of the 1970s. As of August 2010, it stood at 9.5 percent in the U.S. For 10 points, give this term for the percentage of adults who are able and willing to work but do not have jobs.

answer: {Archimedes} of Syracuse

Apocryphally, this man’s gravestone featured a cylinder that was two-thirds the volume of the sphere in which it was inscribed; that relation was something this man had proven. His namesake claw may have been used in war, but it is unlikely that his heat ray ever existed. Also the inventor of a screw for transporting water, this man determined what metal a crown was made of by applying the buoyancy principle in his bathtub to determine the crown’s density. For 10 points, name this ancient Greek who ran around naked shouting “Eureka!” after that discovery.

answer: {surface tension}

This property stays constant after the CMC, or critical micelle concentration, is reached, which comes after a certain amount of surfactants have been added to a solution. Laplace's Law describes why this property is responsible for the nearly spherical form taken on by bubbles and drops of water. This property occurs due to certain molecules of a liquid not being surrounded by attractive charges, leading to stronger cohesion for those molecules. For 10 points, name this property of liquids that is responsible for the ability of water striders to move atop water.
