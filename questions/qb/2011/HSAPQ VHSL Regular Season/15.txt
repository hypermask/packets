answer: {potential} energy

This can be calculated for a magnetic dipole subject to magnetic field by taking the dot product of the magnetic moment times negative one and B. This for an object in an electric field is the product of k and the two charges divided b r. In general this results from having a position within a force field. For a spring, this is equal to one half times the spring constant times the displacement squared. The value of this for an object in the Earth's gravity is mgh.

answer: {buoyancy} [accept {buoyant force}]

The Boussinesq approximation is used in flows driven by this. In one formulation, this force is equal to the pressure at the lower point of contact times the area at that point minus the pressure higher point times that point's area. This is proportional to both gravitational acceleration and the density of the fluid. The basic idea behind this is Archimedes' principle, which says this is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. For 10 points, name this force that allows objects to float in water.
