answer: {photoelectric} effect

This effect dominates in energy regimes under one mega-electron volt, while at higher energies Compton scattering and pair production are likely to occur. It was first observed by Heinrich Hertz while working with spark gaps. Mathematically, this effect is likely to occur when the threshold frequency of the electromagnetic radiation times Planck's constant is equal to the work function, usually represented by a lower case phi. For 10 points, name this effect where incident light on the surface of a metal releases electrons.

Ionic forces explain why lithium oxide is an exception to this theory, which divides compounds into different categories based on a property called the steric number. As a consequence of this theory, methane does not assume a square planar structure since that would space the bonds 90 degrees apart from each other rather than the 109 degrees in its actual shape. Common shapes generated by this theory include see-saw, trigonal bipyramidal, and bent. For 10 points, name this theory of chemical bonding which as its name suggests claims that electrons want to be as far apart as possible.
