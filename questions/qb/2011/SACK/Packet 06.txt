answer: {compactness}

First order logic is the strongest logic satisfying both the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem and the theorem named for this property, according to Lindstrom's theorem. A simple case of that theorem for propositional logic can be proven by showing that Stone spaces have this property. That version of the theorem says that a theory is satisfiable if and only if every finite subset of that theory is satisfiable, and can be proven using Tychonoff's theorem. A real valued function on this type of space attains a maximum, according to the extreme value theorem. The sequential version of this property holds for a set in which all sequences have a convergent subsequence, which in R n is equivalent, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, to being closed and bounded. For ten points, the Heine-Borel theorem gives a characterization of this property in R n which says that any open cover has a finite subcover.

answer: {Peter Diamond}

In 2004, this economist wrote a book arguing against converting Social Security to a funded system, work which draws on his earlier analysis of the efficiency-enhancing properties of inter-generational debt. In one paper, this economist showed that partial equilibrium models of price dispersion motivated by search costs could not survive in general equilibrium, since sellers would not deviate from monopoly pricing. This man’s Coconut Model features agents who will only climb trees if others are doing the same and so will have goods available to trade, an idea that motivates the matching function that is this man’s contribution to the model named for him, Mortensen, and Pissarides. Nominated to the Federal Reserve Board by President Obama in 2010, name this MIT economist, declared academically unqualified to serve by Senator Richard Shelby several weeks before he won the Nobel Prize.

answer: {War Requiem}

The baritone sings of “the blast of lightning from the east, the flourish of loud clouds” in this choral work's fourth movement, while in its third movement the composer introduces and then deconstructs a fugue, mirroring the inversion of the parable of Abraham and Isaac in the accompanying text. The opening bells in this work introduce the F sharp to C tritone, which recurs often as a motif for rest. In this work's last movement, the tenor and baritone repeatedly sing “Let us sleep now” in parallel to the chorus, which concludes with “requiescat in pace”. Earlier the tenor sings of escaping “down some profound dull tunnel” and addresses the baritone as a “strange friend”. This work was commissioned for the reconsecration of Coventry Cathedral. Drawing text from nine poems of Wilfred Owen as well as the Latin Mass, for 10 points, name this work by Benjamin Britten.

answer: {Bose}-{Einstein Condensation} (accept {Bose}-{Einstein Condensates})

Microwave pumping has recently been used to demonstrate that magnons in ferromagnets can undergo this process at relatively high temperatures. The Riemann Zeta function appears in calculations for the critical temperature of this phenomenon, and a formula for the single particle wavefunction of a sample after the sample has undergone this process is the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. This process was initiated for the first time when magnetic evaporative cooling and laser cooling techniques were used to cool a sample of Rubidium-87 atoms to within a fraction of absolute zero. For ten points, identify this doubly-eponymous process possible only for particles with integer spin, in which a large fraction of particles in a sample collapse into the same quantum state.

answer: George Lawrence {Mikan}

In one position, this man was personally sent with a mink coat and a million dollar check to recruit Lew Alcindor, and he instituted both the three point line and a red, white, and blue ball. This first commissioner of the ABA first played professionally for the Chicago American Gears of a league that he led in scoring 6 times, the NBL, and was coached by Ray Meyer at DePaul. His namesake drill involves repeatedly making layups and rebounding with alternate hands. This man was the leading scorer and rebounder on a team that included Jim Pollard, Slater Martin, and Vern Mikkelsen.  The prohibition of goaltending and widening of the lane from six to twelve feet were done to slow down this glasses-wearing player. For ten points, identify this center who won four of the first five NBA championships while playing for the Minneapolis Lakers.

answer: {Melos} (accept {Milos} or {Milo})

This was the main source of obsidian in the ancient Aegean, and uniquely among its neighbors in the Cyclades, it was independent until the Peloponnesian War. Both its weakness and its proximity to Sparta attracted the attention of Athens first in 426 BC. A second infamous Athenian campaign in 416-415 was the contemporary inspiration for Euripides’ play The Trojan Women and was recounted by Thucydides as a namesake “dialogue,” in which the natives argue that Athens should respect their neutrality while Athens insists that her intentions would remain peaceful so long as resistance was abandoned. Subsequently Athens sacked the city, executed its men, enslaved its women and children, and established a cleruchy. For ten points, name this island, the source of a famous Hellenistic statue of Aphrodite.

answer: {Alkyl Halides} or {Haloalkanes}

 In a variant of one reaction to produce these compounds, lead tetraacetate is used to decarboxalate carboxylic acids. That reaction, named for Kochi, is a version of another reaction that creates these using silver salts of carboxylic acids, a reaction named for Hunsdiecker. Atoms from two of these compounds are exchanged, often in the presence of acetone, in the Finkelstein reaction. These compounds are commonly used as solvents for relatively nonpolar compounds, and the formation of alkenes from these compounds is more predictable when done via an E2 mechanism and can be predicted by Zaitsev’s rule. For ten points, name these compounds in which an atom from the series containing flourine replaces the hydrogen atom of an alkane.

answer: Robert {Nozick}

This thinker described the titular group as “wordsmiths” and explained that they feel resentful without the rewards that they feel entitled to receive in “Why Do Intellectuals Oppose Capitalism?” He presented an externalist answer to the Gettier problem, positing that knowledge is a true belief that “tracks truth.” A book by this author is the subject of a refutation by Murray Rothbard that claims that the author’s justification of the Minarchist state is insufficient. He believed that a dominant protective agency would emerge from the state of nature. The Lockean Proviso governs the acquisition principle, which along with transfer and rectification principles, forms his Entitlement theory. For 10 points, what American attacked his Harvard colleague John Rawls in Anarchy, State, and Utopia?

answer: {Christina Rossetti}

In one of this author’s works, the speaker states that “a clock has a face, but no mouth” in “A Pin Has a Head, But No Hair,” and the speaker wishes “that my work be done/As birds’ that soar/Rejoicing the sun” in her poem “A Summer Wish.” The speaker of another poem by this author plucks “pink blossoms” and “wore them all that evening” in her hair before lamenting the loss of her lover Willie after noticing “Plump Gertrude” walking with “a stronger hand than hers” helping hold a basket. In another poem by this author, one character remembers the grave of her deceased sister where “to this day no grass will grow” and warns Laura not to “loiter in the glen/In the haunts of” the title fruit-selling creatures. For 10 points, name this poet of “An Apple-Gathering” and Goblin Market, which was illustrated by her Pre-Raphaelite artist brother.

answer: {Armenia}

Ashot I was the first of his family to consolidate power in this country, which he did during the ninth century AD by playing the Abbasids off against Byzantium. Under that family, the Bagratids, the capital was moved from Kars to Ani, and this kingdom remained intact until it was overrun by the Seljuks. The earlier Artaxiad family ruled this country, and it sheltered Mithridates VI, thus inviting an invasion by Lucullus that seized this country’s capital, Tigranocerta.  Earlier, that king who eventually lost to Rome, Tigranes the Great, had exploited Parthian weakness to annex a number of Seleucid cities. The first twentieth-century version  of this country lasted for two years, from the Russian Revolution to an invasion by Turkish forces, which had support from Moscow. For ten points, what is this country of the southern Caucasus which became independent again after the fall of the Soviet Union, with its present capital at Yerevan?

answer: William {Pitt} the {Younger} (prompt on “{Pitt}”)

Henry Dundas was impeached for mis-appropriation of public money while serving as First Lord of the Admirality in this man’s government, a charge he could not defend since it would have required revealing payments to French spies. This man delayed the Regency Bill, so preventing royal power from passing to the Prince of Wales, who would likely have elevated Charles James Fox over this man. This man supported George III, but fell out with him over the issue of Catholic Emancipation after passing the Act of Union, so he resigned. The fall of this man’s first government, which had staunchly opposed the French revolution and succeeding regimes, was a central reason for the Treaty of Amiens, and the return of this man to power in 1804 hastened the resumption of war with France. For ten points, name this Prime Minister whose father also governed Britain during a long and expensive war with France.

answer: René François Ghislain Magritte

This artist said that upon viewing one of his paintings, “one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?’” He explored the difference between the view seen from outside and inside a room in two paintings that show an easel painted with an image that blends with the outside landscape, both of which are called The Human Condition. A 2007 exhibit of this artist's work featured a ceiling covered with pictures of a freeway, a door modeled after the one found in this artist's The Unexpected Answer, and a carpet patterned after a cloud motif that is commonly found in this artist's works. Other motifs that this artist used were an apple and a bowler hat, both of which are seen in his The Son of Man. For 10 points, name this Belgian surrealist who created Time Transfixed and The Treachery of Images.

answer: Matrix {Multiplication}

A 2005 paper by Cohn and Kleinberg includes a combinatorial conjecture about uniquely solvable puzzles,  which if true, would suggest a O(n^2) (read: “big O of n squared”) algorithm for this problem. That bound is much better than the O(n^2.3) (read: “big O of 2 point 3”) run time provided by the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm. One way of doing this using divide-and-conquer involves dividing each of the input objects into four pieces, although that approach does not speed up this operation without the use of 7 formulas discovered by Volker Strassen. The lower bound on the run time of this process cannot be less than O (n^2)  (read: “big O of n squared”) because there are n squared entries in each of the two input objects. For 10 points, name this mathematical operation whose standard algorithm runs in O(n^3) (read: “big O of n cubed”) time because it involves computing the n squared entries in the product of two objects that each have n rows and n columns.

answer: {Apuleius} (accept {Lucius Apuleius}, {although} I {think that's speculation based} on the name of the {main character} from the {Golden Ass})

In one work by this author, an auctioneer instructs a eunuch to put his face between one character’s thighs to see how big his... “submissiveness” is. The most famous lines of this man's own public speeches are collected in the work Florida. Another of his works is a philosophical discussion of the daimonion and is entitled De Deo Socratis. This man was also renowned as a magician, which led to him being put on trial for using a spell to win the affection of a wealthy widow from Oea named Aemilia Pudentilla. At the climax of this man's most famous work, the protagonist is returned to human form by the goddess Isis, and that work earlier features a long digression on the story of Cupid and Psyche. For 10 points, name this 2nd century AD Roman author of The Golden Ass.

answer: {Heat Shock} Proteins (accept “{chaperone proteins}” before “{40}”)

One of these proteins is a dual ringed tetradecamer that interacts with a “lid” like protein to encapsulate unfolded or poorly-folded proteins. That protein complex undergoes conformational changes in response to ATP to help the encapsulated protein fold correctly. Another of these proteins recognizes and binds to hydrophobic residues on incomplete proteins to stabilize them and prevent them from aggregating. That protein interacts with the 40 version of this kind of protein, which is responsible for regulating the ATPase activity of the 70 version. Transcription of these proteins is upregulated in cells that are exposed to high, sub-lethal temperatures. For 10 points, name these chaperone proteins that provide protection against normally lethal temperatures.
