answer: The {Birthday Party}

One character in this work explains to another that “it gets light later in winter,” and after that character talks about a new show advertised in the morning paper, it is revealed that the protagonist plays piano. The main character in this work is called “a bit of a washout” after a girl delivers a package. Two men in this work approach the proprietor of a boardinghouse on the beach asking about a room, and one of them flirts with a woman who earlier refused to run away with the protagonist. After a game of blindman’s buff, Lulu is found lying spread-eagle on the table, and the protagonist of this work is backed up against the wall, giggling. The central character is eventually removed by McCann and Goldberg from the boardinghouse of Petey and Meg Boles. For 10 points, name this play in which Stanley Webber is taken away after the title event, a work by Harold Pinter.

answer: Graham {Greene}

In one story by this author, the boy “T” leads a group of children in destroying Mr. Thomas’s home when he is away on vacation; that work is called “The Destructors.” Another short story by this author sees the butler Baines fall in the eyes of young Phillip after Baines murders his wife. That story is “The Basement Room.” In a novel by this man, the protagonist leaves a nasty message on a phonograph for his wife, who looks forward to hearing his voice after he blinds himself with the vitriol he always carries and runs off a cliff. Earlier that protagonist had killed Fred, a reporter calling himself Kolly Kibber for a newspaper contest. The dentist Mr. Tench is the first to see another novel’s protagonist, the unnamed “whiskey priest” trying to evade capture by the Communist Mexican government. For 10 points, name this author of Brighton Rock and The Power and the Glory.

answer: {Maxwell}-{Boltzmann} Molecular Speed Distribution

At high temperatures, this function approaches another function sometimes named for Juttner. This function is maximized at the square root of two times t times temperature over mass. Taking the square root of the integral of this function from zero to infinity gives the root mean square speed, and the values of this function decrease exponentially with kinetic energy.  This classical approximation of Fermi-Dirac statistics is equal to the products of the probabilities of the particles in individual dimensions and is the basis for collision theory.  For ten points, name this distribution equivalent to a chi square distribution with three degrees of freedom, the velocity distribution for gases.

answer: Heimdall

One attested nickname of this figure is Vindhler which means “wind shelter”. Hallinskidi is another nickname of this figure, which may mean “bent stick,” and also refers to rams. The man who slept between Ai and Edda to create serfs and Afi and Amma to create herdsmen is said to be this figure, according to the prose introduction to a poem found only in the Codex Wormianus, the Rigsthula. That echoes the suggestion in the first lines of the Voluspa that all races are kinsmen of this figure. In the Husdrapa he fights with another god in the form of a seal in order to retrieve the necklace Brisingamen. This son of nine mothers is destined to be the last of the Aesir to die at Ragnarok where he will kill and be killed by Loki. In addition to the horse Gulltoppr, he is the owner of Gjallarhorn which he will sound to assemble the Aesir. For 10 points, name this Norse god who guards Bifrost, the rainbow bridge to Asgard.

answer: {madrigals}

The advent of this as a popular musical form was the result of the rise of Oltremontani, members of the Dutch School of music who adapted the local forms of frottola and villota into this form. Bernardo Pisano was the first composer of these, and his light, repetitive rhythmic ballads would later inspire Jacques Arcadelt’s First and Second Books. Court composers emulated Arcadelt in works based on poetry by Petrarch or artwork by Michelangelo. This polyphonic form was later mastered by Monteverdi, who developed a new style of this form, rejecting the chromatic nature of his predecessors and infusing the style with his own basso continuo. For 10 points, name this Renaissance singing form usually sung a cappella, the first form of widely published secular music along with the chanson.

answer: {Home Rule} (accept “{District} of {Columbia home rule}” or equivalents before The {Prostrate State})

An act granting this passed Congress in 1973.  This power has periodically been abrogated by Congress, such as when it prohibited funding for the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act of 1992. This was the political object of The Prostrate State, which decried the government of South Carolina, and as part of the negotiations following the 1876 election, one Abbeville newspaper editorialized “It matters little to us who rules in Washington, if South Carolina is allowed to have Hampton and [this].” This was also the aim of a movement to repeal the Act of Union of 1800 and re-establish a parliament separate from that in Westminster, a movement associated with Charles Stewart Parnell. For ten points, what is this political concept, referring to the right of a subordinate jurisdiction to govern itself, championed on behalf of Ireland by William E. Gladstone?

In the canonical DMP model, this endogenous object is determined as the solution to a Nash bargaining problem. As such, it varies too much as Shimer pointed out, resulting in the empirical puzzle of unemployment that is not sufficiently counter-cyclical. Bewley published a subjective study of the empirical “stickiness” of this value, which provides some support to theoretical departures from traditional bilateral efficiency. In the models by Shapiro and Stiglitz, this value is higher than it would be in the absence of shirking, resulting in the so-called “efficiency” one of these. In such cases, piecework is an infeasible alternative to this since the value of an individual’s output is likely to be subjective. For 10 points, what is this word that refers to the price of labor?

answer: A {Season} in {Hell} [or {Une Saison en Enfer}]

The speaker of this work is told that he “will stay a hyena” by a figure with poppies. In one section of this work, the speaker equates a “vision of purity” with a “crippling misfortune,”and in another, the author states that he “invented the color of the vowels” and quotes some of his poetry from memory.  The speaker of this work refers to science as “the new nobility,” and states that “life is the farce we all must play” in its second section.  That chapter describes the speaker’s ancestry as “an inferior race.” This work includes the chapters “The Impossible,” “Bad Blood,” and two “Deliriums,” one of which is written as the confession of the author’s companion in the title place, presumably Paul Verlaine. For 10 points, name this multi-part poem, written under the influence of opium by Arthur Rimbaud.

answer: chariots

A ceremonial example of this item with bronze plates depicting Achilles receiving armor from his mother was unearthed in an Etruscan burial chamber dated to 530 BC and is now on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The earliest finds of this item come from the Sintashta-Petrovka culture, found north of the Aral Sea and dated to around 2500 BC. The first text describing these items in the ancient Near East recounts how King Hattusili I used them against the Hurrians during the conquest of Hattusa, and a later Hurrian-Hittite text written by one Kikkuli of the Mitanni describes a conditioning regimen lasting 214 days. A late and unsuccessful use of these items is reported at the Battle of Gaugamela, where the Macedonian lines parted to let them through, whence they could be attacked from behind. For 10 points, what is this single-axled horse-drawn military device, deployed in great numbers at the Battle of Kadesh?

answer: Bernhard {Riemann}

This mathematician proved an inequality relating the dimension of the vector space of meromorphic functions on a one-dimensional complex manifold with the genus of the manifold, which was later strengthened by Roch. He names manifolds equipped with a positive definite symmetric bi-linear form g, the metric tensor.  The study of such manifolds constitutes his namesake geometry. In his sole paper on analytic number theory he defined an analytic continuation of the infinite p-series to the complex plane and conjectured that its nontrivial zeroes have real part one-half, later generalized to a conjecture about the zeroes of Dirichlet L-functions. The distribution of the prime numbers is governed by the zeroes of his namesake zeta function. For 10 points, name this 19th century German mathematician, who defined his namesake integral as a limit of approximating sums.

answer: {Polymerase Chain Reaction}

Techniques similar to this laboratory technique include NEAR, which uses a nicking enzyme to bypass one of the steps normally needed for this technique, and HDA, which uses helicase to bypass that same step. NEAR and HDA are also notably different from this technique because they can be performed at a constant temperature. Variations of this laboratory technique can be used to determine the methylation pattern of DNA, create point mutations, and assemble multiple pieces of DNA. Important reagents for this technique include a divalent cation, such as magnesium, and a thermostable polymerase, such as Pfu or Taq. This reaction occurs in a thermocycler, which rotates the reaction between the denaturation, annealing, and elongation temperatures. For 10 points, name this technique developed by Kary Mullis that is used to amplify DNA.

answer: {Anti}-{rent} (accept “{Anti}-{rent Wars}” or “{Anti}-{rent Party}”)

According to Eric Foner, this movement was a major reason that homesteading and free labor were adopted into the political platform of the nascent Republican Party. Events associated with this movement came to a head in 1845, when so-called Indians shot a sheriff’s deputy named Osman Steele, after which Governor Silas Wright called on the state militia and the Indians were suppressed in the leasehold towns of Delaware, Schoharie, and Columbia counties, ending this movement's armed insurrectionary phase. Nonetheless this movement was successful at the 1845 New York state legislative elections and thereafter passed a state tax on leasehold income. Leaders of this movement in Columbia County hired William Seward to challenge the title to Livingston Manor. For ten points, name this movement, set off when Steven van Rensselaer’s will pledged uncollected rents to his creditors.

answer: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

The Lorentzian profile due to the natural broadening of spectral lines is due to this statement. Mandelshtam and Tamm used a general observable operator to reformulate an alternative to this statement and other forms of it detail the relation between the phase of the Ginzberg-Landau parameter and the number of electrons in a superconductor. This statement can be viewed as a special case of the Robertson–Schrödinger inequality, and the canonical commutation relation of quantum mechanics can be used to arrive at this relation in its most familiar form. This statement from quantum mechanics comes in energy-time and position-momentum varieties. For 10 points, what statement, named for a German physicist, says that no two non-commuting observables can be simultaneously measured to infinitely high precision?
