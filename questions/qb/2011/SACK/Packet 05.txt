answer: Sherwood {Anderson}

One of this man’s novels describes Bruce Dudley leaving his wife and floating down the Mississippi River. Hemingway’s The Torrents of Spring is a parody of that novel, Dark Laughter. In a short story by this man, the narrator’s father displays preserved mutant chickens in his restaurant and is laughed at by Joe Kane when he can’t perform a trick with the title object, “The Egg.” Doctor Reefy erects “little pyramids of truth” in the slips of paper he is always writing on and stuffing in his pocket in another story, “Paper Pills,” which appears in a book whose framing chapter tells of an old man who has “listed hundreds of truths” in his book of grotesques. Reporter George Willard reappears in several of that work’s chapters, in the last one leaving his title hometown for the big city. For 10 points, name this author of Winesburg, Ohio.

answer: {Septimius Severus}

Herodian denounced this man’s nearly doubling of a soldier's pay as pandering to the army, a view which is reinforced by the spread of the title “Mother of the Camps” for his wife and his lifting of a two-century ban on active soldiers getting married. He may have studied under Quintus Cervidius Scaevola alongside his lifelong friend and prominent jurist Papinian. He was accompanied to his place of death, York, by his wife Julia Domna, and had earlier seen military successes at Lugdunum and Issus. This man defeated his rivals Didius Julianus, Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus, and deified his predecessor Pertinax to win public support after the chaos of the Year of the Five Emperors, as described by Cassius Dio. For 10 points, name this Roman Emperor who was succeeded by his sons Geta and Caracalla and founded a namesake dynasty.

answer: {Polymerization}

One mechanism useful in this process includes an intermediate coordination complex containing an alkene and is named for Cossee and Arlman. It’s not metathesis, but a cyclic molecule is used in the ring-opening form of this process and includes less shrinkage.  This process may be initiated by azo- or peroxy- based initiators, light, or a redox reaction, among other methods. One form of this process begins with a molecule with a double bond and a free radical addition to that double bond. The “living” form of this process allows more control over the end product than the conventional “free radical” type of this process. This process may utilize Ziegler-Natta catalysts, and can be subdivided into initiation, propagation, transfer, and termination steps. For ten points, name this process in which large compounds are formed out of monomers.

answer: The {Mysteries} of {Udolpho}

One character in this work is told not to destroy a miniature portrait, which she keeps with her after burning some mysterious letters of her father’s. A servant named Ludovico tells the main character of this work about a prisoner, Monsieur Du Pont. The protagonist of this work notices that a nun looks like the woman from a portrait at the chateau of the Villefort family. Morano attempts to steal the protagonist of this work away from the title locale, but the protagonist of this novel is ultimately reunited with her lover Valancourt. In the beginning of this novel, the protagonist and her aunt are taken to the central locale, Moroni’s castle in the Apennines. This novel influences Catherine Morland to view the Tilneys’ home as a haunted house in another work. For 10 points, name this Gothic novel about Emily St. Aubert that figures prominently in Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey, a novel by Ann Radcliffe.

answer: {Trout} Quintet {D. 667} (accept “{Piano Quintet} in A {Major}” before mentioned in {question})

This piece’s frequent reuse of musical gestures is referred to by NYU’s Martin Chusid as “mechanical.” Its second movement features a modified submediant, F major, utilizing a tonal pattern from F to G to A minor back to the original F.  That same section of this work contains repeated descending minor triplet scales in the piano that transitions into a syncopation in the strings and keyboard. This work’s fourth section consists of a theme and variations on a song the composer had previously written, entitled “Die Forelle.” For ten points, give this common name for a piano quintet in A major that was written by the composer of a notable B minor “unfinished” symphony, Franz Schubert.

answer: {Nigeria}

This country held a democratic presidential election in 1993 that was won by M.K.O. Abiola, but the election was annulled by the outgoing military regime of Ibrahim Babangida, which had presided over a structural adjustment program in the late 1980s that resulted in this country’s becoming a net food importer. Shortly thereafter, a coup brought another military regime to power, and its rule through the 1990s saw the rise of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, which protested environmental devastation and the expropriation of oil by the central government. The military dictator, Sani Abacha, had the movement’s leader Ken Saro-Wiwa executed in 1995. After the return to civilian control, this country was ruled by Olusegun Obasanjo in the 2000s. For ten points, name this populous West African nation, now ruled by the first President from the Niger Delta, Goodluck Jonathan.

answer: spheres

An exotic version of this type of space, homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the standard type, was constructed by Milnor in dimension 7. All of these spaces can be realized as iterated suspensions of the space of two points. The Hopf fibration exhibits a covering of a 2-dimensional one by a 3-dimensional one whose fiber is a 1-dimensional one of these. The Poincaré-Hopf degree theorem says that maps from a manifold to one of these are classified up to homotopy by their degree, and a standard example of such a map is the Gauss map. Smale demonstrated that a two-dimensional one can be turned inside out without forming creases in this type of eversion. In 3 dimensions the Poincare conjecture states that every simply-connected closed manifold is homeomorphic to one of these. For 10 points, name this space, which may be defined as the subset of Euclidean space given by all points of unit distance from the origin.

answer: {Edward} [accept: {Duarte} from the {Portuguese}]

The King of Portugal with this first name was nicknamed “The Philosopher” and was the grandson of John of Gaunt and the older brother of Prince Henry the Navigator. The oldest son of Scottish nobleman John Balliol, who led a rebellion against the son of Robert the Bruce, had this first name. From 1970 to 1980, Communist Poland was ruled by a man with this first name and the last name “Gierek.” A Saxon English prince with this first name fled to Hungary after the Danish invasion and was nicknamed “the Exile.” An English king with this name defeated a rebellion by Aelfgar of Mercia; that English king was a son of Emma of Normandy and his reign was dominated by Earl Godwin. For ten points, give this first name of a canonized English king nicknamed “the Confessor”.

answer: Henry {IV} [accept “{Henry Bollingbroke}” before mentioned; prompt on “{Henry}” or “{Hal}”]

In one work with this character, Sir Walter Blunt is killed dressed as him. In another, this man accuses Thomas Mowbray of squandering the king’s money. This character dies in the “Jerusalem Chamber,” fulfilling the prophecy that he “should not die but in Jerusalem.” This man had thought that meant the Holy Land and had been planning on crusading there, but those plans were cancelled when he learned one of his lords refused to give this man ransomed prisoners, including Douglas the Scot. Douglas later joins a confederation of rebels that fails when Northumberland is too sick and Glendower too unprepared to assist the forces at a battle where Sir John Falstaff played dead and this character’s son killed the rebel leader Hotspur, the battle of Shrewsbury. For 10 points, name this English king, also known as Henry Bollingbroke, and the title character of two plays by Shakespeare.

answer: {Stark} effect

Inglis and Teller used this effect to derive a namesake equation relating the principal quantum number to electron density. Another version of this effect that occurs with a strong  laser is known as the Autler-Townes effect. Schrodinger used first order perturbation techniques to calculate the energies associated with the linear part of this effect, while second order perturbation theory is needed to account for its quadratic part. Sometimes named for Lo Surdo and somewhat analogous to the Zeeman effect, for ten points, identify this effect whereby spectral lines are split in the presence of an electric field.

answer: {Rational Expectations}

The first use of this in a macro-economic model appears in the article “Investment Under Uncertainty,” which uses the concept of an equilibrium of this type. Firms invest given a prior belief about the distribution of output prices, and given aggregate investment, the prior and posterior distributions of market prices are identical, or equivalently, the first moment of agents’ forecast error is zero. Kydland and Prescott argued that due to this concept, discretionary monetary policy is never ‘credible’ and thus ineffective. This concept motivates a critique of macro-econometric models in the style of Katz and Tinbergen since in those models, agents don’t change their behavior in response to policy changes. That critique is named after one of the authors of “Investment Under Uncertainty,” Robert Lucas. For ten points, what is this economic concept, which caused an eponymous “revolution” in 1970s macroeconomics?

answer: {Stockholm}

On August 10, 1628, the largest warship in the world was launched from this city and foundered one mile from its mooring. A critical event in this city’s growth was the prohibition of all export trade through Gaevle, thus giving this city a hinterland consisting of the entire Norrland. That policy was the work of the Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who aimed to turn this into an imperial city. A notorious event named for this city occurred when Archbishop Gustavus Trolle, King Christian II’s agent in this city, took violent revenge on the Sture faction, a policy that was the beginning of the end for the Kalmar Union. For ten points, name this site of a famous “bloodbath” which was ruled in the early seventeenth century by Gustavus Adolphus, the capital of Sweden.

answer: {Diadumenos} or {Diadem} Bearer (accept equivalents)

The Esquiline Venus is sometimes considered a female version of this statue since it is performing a similar action.  One marble version of this statue features a cloak and quiver resting on its tree-stump support, suggesting that the central figure is Apollo.  That version, housed in the National Archaelogical Museum of Athens, is missing its forearms and hands. This statue stands in contrapposto, and the ball of his right foot barely rests on the base of the statue.  His head is turned to the right and tilted down as his arms are lifted up with the titular item in both hands as he ties it around his head, a pose meant to convey suitable modesty at a moment of glory.  Along with the spear bearer Doryphoros and the discus bearer Discophorus, it completes its creator’s Canon.  For 10 points, name this young victorious athlete by Polykleitos.

answer: Royal Proclamation of {1763}

This document was the basis for John Marshall’s decision in Johnson v. M’Intosh [read: MACKINTOSH]. The ancestors of the plaintiffs in that action shared George Washington’s opinion that this document was “a temporary expedient to quiet the minds of Indians.” This document initially failed in that task as the coalition of tribes that launched Pontiac’s War might well have realized that by making the British Crown the sole purchaser of land west of the Appalachian Ridge, this document created a monopsony where great competition previously existed. For ten points, what is this document, issued by King George III to restrict the private purchase of land acquired from France by the Treaty of Paris earlier in the namesake year?

answer: {bathers} [or {baigneuses}]

In one painting of these figures, only one of them faces the front of the painting while two others are looking over their left shoulders; that painting is by Gauguin. One of these figures is depicted sitting on a bed while wearing a turban and draping a sheet over her left arm, and that figure is notably copied into the artist’s painting of many of them in a harem. One depiction of these figures shows them in two symmetrical groupings relaxing between arching trees. In addition to the “Valpinçon” one painted by Ingres and the “Large” ones depicted by Cezanne, one of these figures cups his hands in front of his mouth and wears an orange hat while one in the center sits near his shoes and a straw hat on the bank of the Seine. For 10 points, name these figures that are depicted “at Asnieres” by Seurat.

answer: Call of Duty: Black Ops (prompt on partial {title})

Two characters in this game go to the world’s first operational space launch center to assassinate Nazis seeking refuge in the Soviet Union, resulting in the capture of the protagonist’s partner and the loss of that partner’s left eye. Its multiplayer mode removed the ability of kill streaks to stack, and replaced the Stinger anti-air missile with the Strela-2. Powerups the player can use in this game include a  SR-71 Blackbird that reveals the direction opponents are facing. At the conclusion of this game’s single player mode, the main character is revealed to be a Soviet sleeper agent who intends to release the nerve agent Nova-6 into the United States, and he is hinted by the game to be the man who assassinated John F. Kennedy. For ten points, name this game that features Alex Mason as part of the titular Special Activities Division by Treyarch, the seventh entry in the Call of Duty series.
