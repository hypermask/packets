answer: {Ignatius} J. {Reilly}

This man wrote a monograph about the sorry fate of Piers Plowman and the “perversion of having to GO TO WORK.” He is unsure whether it was accepted, though, because it was written entirely on Big Chief tablets in pencil. The Consolation of Philosophy is a major inspiration for this man, as is Batman, which he recommends to a resident of the French Quarter this man meets while selling hot dogs advertised as “Twelve inches of Paradise.” His pyloric valve is a constant source of discomfort until he leaves his mother and New Orleans with former classmate Myrna Minkoff. This book opens with him shopping for his mother wearing the tweed trousers, plaid flannel shirt and green hunting cap he has throughout the novel. For 10 points, name this protagonist of A Confederacy of Dunces.

answer: The {Red Queen} Hypothesis (accept the {Law} of {Extinction} before {meiosis})

The scientist that first proposed this theory described it as explaining the way that trophic energy is a major controller of life. Graham Bell expanded this theory to also explain why some organisms use meiosis to only pass on half of their individual genes to their offspring. An example of this would be the natural selection of foxes that run fast enough to catch rabbits, and the subsequent selection of rabbits that are able to outrun those faster foxes. This theory was proposed by Leigh Van Valen to explain that because evolution of one species may result in the extinction of another, both species must be constantly evolving in order to stay extant. For 10 points, name this hypothesis that uses a quote from a fictional character to explain the evolutionary arms race and the advantages of sexual reproduction.

answer: {Fountains} of Rome or {Fontane di Roma}

The third section of this work features long glissandos in the harps and piano through an allegro vivace, which transitions into a chromatic progression in the high strings, flute, and clarinet marked piu vivace and telling the conductor to gesture three beats in each measure. That same section then slows down into a D major largamente in which the organ sustains a fortissimo chord accompanied by arpeggios in the woodwinds. After that section of this work is another where the music of the titular god is represented by the French Horn emulating the sound of conch shells. That section foreshadows the arrival of Neptune to Trevi, after which the sun sets at the Villa Medici. For ten points, name this Ottorino Resphigi work about visits to some water-spouting artwork, which along with “Roman Festivals” and “Pines of Rome” make up his Roman Trilogy.

answer: {Birth control} (accept {contraception} before “{abortion}” is read)

In 1907, Nelly Roussel, a French proponent of this practice, sued the right-wing publisher Guy de Cassagnac for labeling her one of “these sorts of viragos” who “mount their pens like they mount a broom to go to a midnight orgy.” In most models of the demographic transition, the diffusion of this practice occurs in the third stage, after the death rate has already declined, but studies of France in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries show that some forms of this practice became widespread even before the Napoleonic Code outlawed primogeniture, partially explaining the shift away from a Malthusian equilibrium. Prolonged breastfeeding is one form of this practice, and as a corollary the use of wet nurses may be understood as a status symbol signifying the luxury of dispensing with this practice. For ten points, name this practice, forms of which include ortho-tri-cyclen, early withdrawal, and abortion.

answer: The {Return} of the {Native}

Before the sixth book of this novel, called Aftercourses, the author includes a footnote saying the marriage that ends that book was forced on him by his editors. In this work, the protagonist’s mother comes to visit him while he is asleep, and she assumes he is avoiding her. On her way home, she collapses from the heat and  is bitten by a snake, so her last words are what she says to Susan Nunsuch’s son. The protagonist of this novel works in the fields as a furze-cutter after excessive reading made him blind, to the dismay of his wife, a woman raised in Budmouth who hoped that by marrying him she could live a cosmopolitan life in Paris. That woman was originally in love with Damon Wildeve, who instead marries Thomasin, the protagonist’s cousin. For 10 points, name this work in which Clym Yeobright returns to Egdon Heath, a novel by Thomas Hardy.

answer: Church of {Santa Maria Novella}

Frescoes for one of this church’s chapels were commissioned from Domenico Ghirlandaio in 1485 and depict two cycles: scenes from the life of the Virgin and of Saint John the Baptist. Another chapel is the meeting place where the principals of the Decameron decide to leave Florence to escape the plague. This church’s most famous decoration is a crucifixion fresco with a classical architectural setting by Masaccio, sometimes called The Holy Trinity. The completed façade of this church is the work of Leon Batista Alberti, and his s-curved scrolls flanking the classical pediment became a model for Renaissance church facades. For ten points, name this Florentine church that houses the Tornobuoni and Strozzi chapels, as well as a crucifix by Brunelleschi, and whose name signifies that it replaced an earlier structure of the same patron.

answer: {Dahomey}

Accounts of this polity dating to the early nineteenth century claim that its corps of female soldiers held pride of place in the army, with the honor of making the first charge, and Richard Burton wrote of the “masculine physique of the women, enabling them to compete with men in enduring toil, hardship and privations.” This polity had an inland orientation, to the point that the settlement through which it carried out its chief trade before the mid-nineteenth century had no port, and today that settlement contains the Door of No Return. That settlement, Whydah, was made subject to this polity under King Agaja in 1727. This polity was centered on Abomey, whence its armies subjugated the surrounding territories for slaves to trade to Portuguese and English merchants in the Bight of Benin. For ten points, name this polity, annexed by the French in the late nineteenth century and independent under this name before it became Benin in 1972.

answer: {Neutron} Stars

A group of nearby objects of this type are known as “The Magnificent Seven” and they cool via a process named after a casino in Rio de Janeiro known as the URCA process. Around five percent appear to occur in binary systems, and those that occur with black holes may possibly be used to detect gravitational waves. When the Akmal-Pandharipande-Ravenhall Equation of State is used, an upper mass limit of around 2.1 solar masses is obtained, while the upper mass limit on these objects when they are composed entirely of the namesake particles is called the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit. For ten points, identify these remnant stars that are formed during the gravitational collapse of a stellar core during a Type II Supernova.

answer: {Buffalo} Soldiers

One of these units engaged with German forces at the Battle of Ambos Nogales, the only direct contact between the US and German armies in North America during World War One. Some of these units comprised the Punitive Expedition under their most famous commander. The first of these units, the 10th cavalry regiment, was organized by Benjamin Grierson in 1866, and these troops fought in several Indian Wars in the Southwest and plains. They were used to arrest striking miners in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, in 1899, reportedly because they would further inflame the miners. General John Pershing earned his nickname for having served with one of these units during the Spanish-American War. For ten points, name these US Army soldiers who got their name from a confrontation with a band of Cheyenne because they reportedly fought like a cornered one of the namesake animals, whose history was later used as an allegory for armed black resistance by Bob Marley.

answer: {Super Bowl III} or {Baltimore Colts} vs. {New York Jets} (cities or team names acceptable) or {1969 Super Bowl}

On the last play of the first half of this game, an unsuccessful flea flicker intended for Jerry Hill was intercepted by Jim Hudson, while Jimmy Orr was wide open in the end zone but camouflaged by the band members behind him. The primary running backs in this game were Matt Snell and Tom Matte. One team in this game had earlier that season played in the Heidi game, and the coach of the other team, Don Shula, brought an aging future Hall of Famer off the bench to replace Earl Morrall. This was the first Super Bowl won by an AFL team, and three days before the game, the quarterback of the 20 point underdogs guaranteed a victory.  For ten points, identify this game in which Johnny Unitas’s team lost to a team quarterbacked by Joe Namath.

answer: The {Massacre} at {Chios} or {Massacre} of {Chios}

The viewpoint of this painting is a stylized version of Mount Pelineon, whence the main harbor of this work’s setting can be seen in the background. Three soldiers appear in this work, all of them portrayed with dark skin, in anachronistic contrast to the thirteen light-skinned civilians. The foreground consists of two groupings of figures: the one to the left is compromised of four couples, two of them in a last embrace, the other two seemingly resigned to their fate. The mounted soldier on the right is poised to strike down a civilian whose arm is raised in hopeless self defense. Below them, an infant crawls to its mother’s breast, though she is already struck with rigor mortis,  while a young nude woman writhes in her restraints. For ten points, name this painting of the events that began in April 1822 on a certain Aegean island, a work of Eugene Delacroix.

answer: {Density}

The Girolami method gives a back of the envelope approach for calculating this quantity for pure liquid components of mixtures at room temperature. In astrophysics, a hypothesis named after Lin and Shu details how waves of this quantity create spiral arms in galaxies. In electromagnetism, the energy variety of this quantity often acts as a physical pressure and can be given in units of pressure. In condensed matter physics, a certain theory named for this quantity treats the probability of finding an electron in a given volume as a functional. For ten points, name this quantity coming in energy, number, and mass varieties, often symbolized “rho,” that measures the amount of something in a given volume.

answer: {Diffusion}

One equation predicting the coefficient of this process says it equals Boltzmann’s constant times temperature over 6 pi times viscosity times radius. Another law governing this process says that the coefficient of this process equals one third times the mean free path times the mean speed.   By considering a one-dimensional random walk modeling this process, the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation can be derived. The namesake equation of this process shows that the rate of it is proportional to the curvature of the concentration with respect to distance, and may be generalized by accounting for convective flux. The earlier mentioned equations are the Stokes-Einstein equation and Fick’s law.  For ten points, identify this process , the migration of matter down a concentration gradient.

answer: {dimension}

In commutative algebra this mathematical concept is defined for rings as the supremum of the number of strict inclusions in a chain of prime ideals and is named after Krull. The invariance of domain theorem shows that this is a homeomorphism invariant for Euclidean spaces. For subsets of Euclidean space this concept has a generalization to fractional values given by finding the critical value alpha at which the exterior alpha Hausdorff measure does not vanish or equal infinity, which is used to define this for fractals. For connected manifolds this integer is defined in reference to what Euclidean space the manifold is locally homeomorphic to. For vector spaces this is defined to be the cardinality of any basis. For 10 points name this concept, which for the Euclidean space R^n [read “R-N”] is equal to the number of coordinates n.

answer: {Samuel}

In this man’s farewell speech he warns his people that disobeying the Lord would lead to foreign invasion. This man organized Israel’s army after instructing his people to remove their idols, and after this man offers a lamb to God, the Philistines are defeated at Mizpah; it was near there that this man erected a monument named Ebenezer. He tells Eli about a prophecy against his house after being called by God several times in his sleep, and before this man’s birth, Eli believes this man's mother to be drunk at Shiloh while she is mumbling during prayer. In the first chapter of the first book named for this man, he is born to Elkanah and Hannah. For 10 points, name this figure from the Bible who anoints both Saul and David in his two namesake books.

answer: {Spartan Constitution} (accept {Constitution} of {Lycurgus} and {variants} until {he} is named; accept {Great Rhetra})

The poems of Tyrtaius and Alkman are roughly contemporaneous sources for this document, which was probably written in the early 600s BC. According to Plutarch, its author obtained a Delphic prophecy exhorting its adoption. Both Xenophon and Aristotle wrote books about this document, lauding its promotion of eunomia. The latter’s commentary is lost and the former entirely neglects the motive for the  institutions this document created, such as the agoge and the krypteia. That motive was the continued subjugation of the numerically superior inhabitants of the Messenian plain, who were forced to serve as helots after losing two wars to the state this document governed. For ten points, name this document, traditionally ascribed to Lycurgus, which sets up the political and social institutions of a certain militaristic Peloponnesian city-state.

Two characters in this novel die after driving a car they named Covadonga, and another character discovers that her husband has been taking strange pictures of the Indian servants. The patriarch of this work’s central family visits the Red Lantern to see Transito Soto, who serves as a foil to his sister Ferula. Another character in this work is Jean de Satigny, who marries the patriarch’s daughter after revealing her affair with another character. The patriarch pursues that character and succeeds in cutting off three of Pedro Tercero’s fingers, but in the end he allows his daughter Blanca to escape political upheaval with Pedro in Canada. Blanca is one of a line of female characters in this novel with similar names: her daughter is named Alba, and her clairvoyant mother is named Clara. For 10 points, name this novel about several generations of the Trueba family, a work of Isabel Allende.

answer: {Indian Railways} (accept equivalents)

The Earl of Mayo canceled the second round of this project for fiscal reasons, in part because the straight ascents at Tlal and Bhor Ghat had cost much more than even the pessimistic estimates of this project’s chief engineer, Major Kennedy. One recent academic publication studying the effect of  this project concluded that it increased real income by 16%, an estimate that was in part carried out by studying the decline in the price of salt at sites distant from mines at Kohat and the Sambhar Salt Lake. Notwithstanding that, Mahatma Gandhi said “there can be little doubt that [this project] promotes evil.” The first eastern portion of this project linked the coalfields of Bardhaman to Howrah station, on the west bank of the Hooghly opposite Calcutta. For ten points, what is this infrastructure network, which now employs 1.6 million people and whose main lines link cities like Bombay and Delhi?

In the Preface to Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth criticized this man’s artificial diction in works like “Sonnet on the Death of Mr. Richard West.” This man drew upon a Welsh legend that Edward I had all bards there put to death in a Pindaric ode, The Bard. In another poem, “the pensive Selima reclined / Gazed on the lake below” before “she tumbled headlong in” and drowns; that poem is “Ode on the Death of a Favorite Cat.” The speaker of another poem watches schoolboys play and does not tell them of the sorrows they will experience in life, reasoning “where ignorance is bliss, / ‘Tis folly to be wise.” For 10 points, name this author who, in addition to “Ode to a Distant Prospect of Eton College,”  wrote “the curfew tolls the knell of parting day”  in “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.”
