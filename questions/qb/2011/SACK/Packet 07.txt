answer: {King} of {Hungary} [accept: {Magyar Kiraly}]

When this title was created, it replaced the earlier title of “fejedelem” [FEY-ed-el-em]. The second holder of this title won the Battle of Menfo; that second holder was targeted by the Vatha and Samuel Aba rebellions and was nicknamed “the Venetian.” Another early holder of this title annexed a neighboring country via the “Pacta Conventa” treaty. Charles Robert of Anjou was the first foreigner to hold this title and received it by election rather than inheritance. Another holder of this title organized a band of mercenaries called the “Black Army.” Holders of this title are granted the style “your Apostolic Majesty,” and it was first held by members of the Arpad Dynasty. Holders of this title wore the Holy Crown of St. Stephen and included Matthias Corvinus. For ten points, name this title that involves reigning over a Danubian country with capital Budapest.

answer: Guru {Nanak} Dev

This figure once used the timbers of a door frame he broke to destroy the bed of his poor host. That host later found four pots of treasure that had been buried beneath the bedposts. Siho, Saido, and this man once walked across the ocean to Singhala-Dipa, where he was carried to a palace by Shiv Nabha. Shiv Nabha and Chandkala later slaughtered their son and ate him at this man's bidding. After a religious experience in the Kali Bein, this figure once claimed that “God is everywhere” to justify sleeping with his feet facing the Ka'ba on his journey to Mecca. Two sets of flowers were placed with his body when he died in order to settle a dispute over whether to cremate or bury this man, each of which was advocated by one of the two groups of his followers. For 10 points, name this man who declared “There is neither Hindu nor Muslim,” and whose sayings are collected in the Adi Granth, the first guru of Sikhism.

answer: {Joseph} Andrews

The protagonist of this novel is taken to the inn of Mr. Tow-wouse after he is found beaten and robbed in a ditch. At the inn he meets his parson and teacher, who is going to London to get sermons published. Later the protagonist of this work stays in the home of Mr. Wilson, who has retired from a life of debauchery in London to live virtuously and comfortably in the country, his only regret being that his youngest son was stolen by gypsies. Not surprisingly, that son turns out to be the protagonist of this work. He doesn't learn this, though, until with Parson Adams he has returned to the estate where he was a footman, after leaving it to escape the amorous intentions of his employer, Lady Booby. For ten points, name this novel by Henry Fielding about the virtuous brother of Pamela Andrews.

answer: {Carthage} (accept {Cartagena})

One city by this name is located at the confluence of the Caney Fork and Cumberland Rivers. The establishment of the Viceroyalty of New Grenada was a boon for a different city of this name, since it became the de-facto capital and a naval base. That is why it was targeted by Edward Vernon in the most significant battle of the War of Jenkins’ Ear. That city is called this “of the Indies” and is located in Colombia. The sailors who founded that city came from another city of this name located on the coast of Murcia, also an important naval station. That city, in turn, was named “new” this by Hasdrubal Barca in 224 BC, after its mother city located on a spit of land between Lake Tunis and the Mediterranean, where it had separate ports for its naval and merchant fleets. For ten points, what is this city name that began when Queen Dido cut a cowhide into strips to enclose the land that became this city?

answer: Erich {Hückel}

A set of approximations named for this chemist sets overlap integrals and resonance integrals between non-neighbors equal to zero, and are used in a method named for him. The extended version of that method considers sigma orbitals, unlike the basic version which only considers pi bonds. That extended version is the basis for the Woodward Hoffman rules. This man names a rule that predicts a property that is contrasted with one in which orbitals are twisted. He is the second namesake of an equation used to calculate the mean ionic activity coefficient of an electrolytic solution, an equation also named for Debye. For ten points, name this formulator and namesake of a rule which is the opposite of Mobius aromaticity, sometimes known as the 4n+2 rule.

answer: {Hundred Years} War

Early in this war, Sir Walter Manny led a violent sack of the island of Cadsand. Bishop Henry Burghersh announced the declaration of this war in one side’s capital. The War of the Two Peters is sometimes considered part of this war. This war was complicated by the death of the last member of the House of Dreux, Duke John III, which led to a succession struggle between the houses of Blois and Montfort that became part of this war. The last phase of this war saw the Battle of Formigny and the decisive use of cannons in its last battle, Castillon. The Treaty of Brétigny was signed during this war, in which King John the Good of France was captured. Also including the Battles of Sluys, Crecy, and Agincourt, for ten points, name this Franco-English war that lasted from 1337 to 1453.

answer: {Batman} Begins

 An early scene in this film shows the protagonist returning from Princeton and a female assassin killing a common criminal. Previously, the protagonist wandered through India and China, stealing from his own company, before being captured by police. The protagonist of this film burns down the headquarters of the League of Shadows after an incident involving some blue flowers, and in retaliation his house is set on fire on his birthday by the villain. That villain’s objective in this film involves the transport of a waterborne hallucinogen and its activation by a microwave emitter; that villain first revealed himself to the protagonist as Henri Ducard but is later exposed as Ra’s al Ghul, who later dies when Jim Gordon uses the Tumbler to destroy an overhead train track. For ten points, name this 2005 film about the titular hero’s origins, whose sequel is “The Dark Knight.”

In one of this man’s plays, a character throws a fit relating how Grace told him to “Help yourself” when he took a piece of toast from her plate. That man, Teach, later persuades his friend to not have an employee steal the title object, and he attacks the employee when Teach believes he has been betrayed. In another of this man’s works, characters discuss the wisdom of Jerry Graff in buying a list of nurses to do business with and consider going to work for him. Later in that play, it is revealed that Bruce and Harriet Nyborg are insane and can’t possibly afford the $82,000 piece of real estate Shelly Levene sold them. In that work by this author, Levene confesses to breaking into the office to steal the “premium leads” sent from Mitch and Murray. For 10 points, name this playwright, author of American Buffalo and Glengarry Glen Ross.

answer: {cats}

One of these creatures is ridden by a figure identified with Devasena, the wife of Skanda; that figure is a Hindu goddess from Bangladesh associated with childbirth named Shashti. According to the Welsh Triad, one of these creatures was the offspring of the sow Henwen and haunted the isle of Anglesey, where it was slain either by Sir Cai [read: KAY] or King Arthur. When Typhon attacked Olympus, Artemis hid by assuming the form of one of these creatures. In a contest rigged by Utgard-Loki, Thor was embarrassed when he was unable to lift Jormungandr who had been disguised as one of them. In addition, the footfalls of one of these animals were among the ingredients in fashioning Gleipnir, and some rather large ones pull the chariot of Freya. For 10 points, name this animal whose head was often depicted on the Egyptian goddess Bast.

answer: {Hall} Effect (accept “{Quantum Hall}” or “{Fractional Quantum Hall}” before (*))

The Laughlin wavefunction was constructed as an ansatz to explain a certain variety of this effect, and the idea of composite fermions was developed to explain that same variety (*). In order to measure this effect’s namesake coefficient for a roughly two-dimensional sample of arbitrary shape, the Van der Pauw method is particularly useful. An analogue of this effect that utilizes a disc-shaped sample instead of a rectangular one is known as the Corbino effect. Its quantum version was discovered by Klaus von Klitzing in 1980. For ten points, identify this electromagnetic effect whereby a magnetic field perpendicular to an electric current creates a voltage difference across two sides of a sample.

Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were two Black Panthers shot to death in this city while they were asleep. Anthony Abbate (read: A BODY) violently beat the bartender Karolina Obrycka in this city after she refused to continue serving him. Jon Burge was convicted of perjury in this city in 2010, which he committed in the course of civil suits against him for the torture he ordered as Commander of the Area 2 violent crimes unit in the 1980s. In 1886, seven anarchists were sentenced to death in this city following an incident when a pipe bomb explosion caused a line of policemen to fire into a crowd of striking workers in Haymarket Square in this city. For ten points, what is this city notorious for police violence, particularly the violence ordered by Mayor Richard J. Daley during the 1968 Democratic National Convention?

answer: {Evian Accords}

Delays in the negotiation of this treaty led to the October 17 riots. One side in this treaty had previously proposed an agreement called the “Peace of the Brave”, which had been rejected. The negotiation of this treaty was interrupted by a dispute over whether the MNA should be allowed to join the talks, but they were excluded at the insistence of the GPRA. A key issue in this treaty was one side’s ability to use a naval base at Mers-el-Kebir, and another major issue was how much autonomy would be given to a group called the “Black Feet” or  pied-noir. Shortly after this treaty was signed, Ben Bella became president of one of its signatories. This treaty was signed by the FLN and represented victory in its struggle with France. For ten points, name this 1962 agreement signed by Charles de Gaulle, which gave independence to Algeria.

answer: {Normal Form}

One method of proving that every context free language is accepted by some non-deterministic push-down automaton involves a transformation of a grammar into one of these in which every production rule takes a nonterminal symbol to exactly one terminal followed by some nonterminals. In addition to the one named for Greibach, there is one named for Kuroda into which there is a transformation for every context-sensitive language. The CYK algorithm requires the grammar be in one of these named for Chomsky. For some sets of functional dependencies, the Boyce-Codd one of these is not always attainable, unlike the first three, of the six that are often applied to databases. For 10 points, give this two word phrase that denotes a standard way of displaying a formal grammar as well a canonical organization of a relational database.

In one work by this artist, the title character places her hand on the window frame while posing in a pink light summer dress. In addition to painting that portrait of Esmerelda Brandini, this artist also painted a series entitled Scenes from the Life of Moses, and he depicted the title figure dipping her brush into some ink as two angels crown her in Madonna of the Magnificat. This artist depicted Cosimo de’ Medici kneeling in front of Mary in The Adoration of the Magi. To the left of one painting by this man, a man raises a rod toward the sky while standing next to three dancing women in flowing translucent dresses. In another of his works, winged Zephyrs swoop in from the left, and the title figure stands on a seashell. For 10 points, name this early Renaissance painter of Primavera and The Birth of Venus.

answer: {Gluconeogenesis}

One regulator of this pathway is FOXO1 (read: “Fox-Oh-one”), which stimulates this process by increasing transcription of necessary enzymes. Another positive regulator of this pathway causes the degredation of fructose 2,6 bisphosphate and inhibits a pathway that runs opposite to this one; that enzyme is PKA. The Cori cycle uses this pathway to generate glucose from a compound that is produced by the body during exercise.  Activation of this pathway causes increased transcription of PEPCK (read: “pep C K”) and glycogen-6-phosphotase. Those enzymes are needed to reverse the reactions catalyzed by hexokinase and pyruvate kinase. For 10 points, name this process stimulated by glucagon that takes place in the mitochondria and cytosol of hepatocytes and uses substrates like lactate and glycerol to produce glucose.
