answer: {Fleetwood Mac}

In 2008, this band denied a claim that Sheryl Crow would join this band to replace Christine, its bassist’s wife.  A year later on a greatest hits tour, Unleashed, Christine appeared in the audience at a London show, at which this group’s lead singer dedicated a song to her that was covered by the Dixie Chicks for their 2002 album Home.  The lyrics admit, “Well I’ve been afraid of changing / ‘cause I’ve built my life around you” and is called “Landslide”.  Two of their most famous songs tell the listener, “You can call it another lonely day” and in another,  “All your life you've never seen / A woman taken by the wind.”  For 10 points, name this band whose hits “Go Your Own Way” and “Rhiannon” were sung by Stevie Nicks.

answer: {Dance} of {Death} (accept {Danse Macabre}, {Danse} de la {Mort}, {Totentanz}, etc.)

One example of this allegorical work shows a fat abbot exhorting God to spare him from the title figure, who wears a bishop’s mitre and, carrying a bishop’s staff in one hand, drags the abbot by his cloak with the other. That work is part of a series on this theme by Hans Holbein. Another example of this allegory shows three of the title figures with their hands joined in celebration while a fourth plays an oboe. Below them, a shroud is torn away from a supine one of the title figures, around whom snakes writhe. The earliest known example of this allegory was contained in the Cemetery of the Church of the Holy Innocents in Paris. In that work, which is lost, the title figure led the pope, the emperor, the nobleman, the laborer, and the small child away. For ten points, name this allegory common in the early Renaissance, in which the inevitability of the title figure’s arrival is typically depicted as applying to all walks of life.

answer: {multiple equilibria} (accept {clear knowledge} equivalents: {plural equilibria}, etc.)

Problems related to this arise in the econometrics of strategic interaction since there is not a mapping from observable outcomes to underlying parameters unless some identifying assumption is used. This is a feature of Diamond and Dybvig’s model of bank runs since patient depositors may or may not withdraw their deposits in period one. So Morris and Shin offer a modification in which depositors observe the period two return with noise, in which case the equilibrium is in cutoff strategies. Thomas Schelling’s notion of the ‘focal point’ is a means to predict which outcome of games with this property will be observed. Schelling’s famous example is that “noon at Grand Central” would be chosen by any two individuals looking to meet in New York City. For 10 points, what is this feature, in which there is more than one outcome of a game in which each player’s strategy is optimal given the strategies of the other players?

answer: {Chloroplast}

Members of the chromista supergroup contain a nucleomorph, a reduced nucleus whose presence supports the most popular theory regarding the formation of these. One important event in the evolution in this organelle was the development of protein import machinery, the translocases TIC and TOC. The innermost membrane of this organelle contains the stroma which surrounds granum, or stacks of thylakoid discs, connected by lamellae. In Euglena and some dinoflagellates, these are surrounded by three membranes as a result of a secondary endosymbiotic events. The ancestor of this organelle was a chlorophyll a containing cyanobacteria that was incorporated into an archaeplastidan.  For 10 points, name this organelle found in plant cells that performs photosynthesis.

answer: Anton {Webern}

This composer's only symphony is a succession of musical palindromes nested within larger palindromes and contains multiple canonic forms; it is in two movements and approximately 9 minutes long. This man’s second cantata draws text from six poems of Hildegard Jone, and he adapted numerous poems of Stefan George into lieder. His Variations for Piano obscure the structure of a canon in the second movement Sehr schnell and lack any crescendo and diminuendo markings. His Passacaglia features 23 variations grouped in three paragraphs over a eight-note bass line centered on the key of D-minor, and is his Opus 1. He is famed for his characteristic brevity and his use of the twelve-tone technique. For 10 points, name this Austrian composer, a member of the Second Viennese School and pupil of Schoenberg.

answer: {Palatine} (German: {Pfalz})

One use of this word, found in the royal charter for Maryland given to Cecilius Calvert, refers to the governor’s right to wage war and establish his own nobility. When attached to the name of a castle in the territory of the Holy Roman Empire, this word means that the castle was a temporary seat of power for the Emperor and as such, ruled by a count with this title and local rights approaching those of the sovereign.  Conrad Hohenstaufen, Frederick Barbarossa’s younger brother, was the first to hold this hereditary title in the territory that eventually became the German state so named today, which was the chief lay electorate under the Golden Bull of 1356.  Prince Rupert of the Rhine was a later holder of that title, over whose succession a war was fought at the end of the seventeenth century. For ten points, what is this word, which names the Roman hill where the emperor’s palace was located?

answer: {Broca’s} Area

 This is located in the inferior frontal gyrus of the brain and consists of the pars opercularis and pars triangularis. In addition to its most well known function, this area of the brain is associated with motor-related processes such as grasping and with interpreting the actions of others. The scientist that names this region of the brain characterized it after discovering lesions in the brains of patients, the first of whom was nicknamed “Tan” because of his limited vocabulary. Lesions in this area are described as an expressive and agrammatic aphasia. Patients with an aphasia of this area are able to understand what is said to them but are unable to speak fluently, producing only disjointed words. For 10 points, name this area of the brain that, unlike Wernicke’s area, is involved in language production.

One holder of this title who was nicknamed “The Lion” was forced to sign the unfavorable Treaty of Lambert after the defeat of his navy, which was led by Eustace the Monk. Another holder of this title won a battle that led to Otto IV being deposed as Holy Roman Emperor. Yet another holder of this title was nicknamed “The Father of the People.” The League of Venice was organized against another holder of this title, and defeated him at the Battle of Fornovo. Another holder of this title had to fight the Mad War against the League of the Public Weal. Advisors or generals serving the holder of this title have included Turenne, Turgot, Sully, and Mazarin. For ten points, give this title most notably held by the “Sun King”, Louis XIV.

answer: {Defects} or {imperfections} or {impurities} in crystal {structure/lattice} (accept equivalent, or {dislocations} before “{color}”)

The Frank-Read mechanism is one cause of these entities, and the Burgers vectors represent the presence of one form of these. These can be represented with Kroger-Vink notation. A color change is associated with one of these phenomena, caused by trapped unpaired electrons, and is known as Fabrentzeum, or F-Center. Examples of these entities in certain materials include the Schotky and Frenkel varieties.  Depending on the dimension, these occurrences can be of point, line, interfacial, or bulk forms. Creating these intentionally is known as doping.  For ten points, identify these objects caused when the movement of an atom requires breaking of bonds in a crystal.

answer: Mikhail {Lermontov}

This author wrote a work about a battle on the title river, Valerik. One work by this author featured a fistfight between both of the protagonists that kills an oprichnik; that work was adapted into Anton Rubinstein’s The Merchant Kalashnikov. Another work by this author treats its subject as a seductress living in a tower “in the deep ravine of the Daryal.” That subject, in fact a medieval Queen of Georgia, shares the name of a character in another of this man’s poems, in which she begs her father to allow her to become a nun after her bridegroom dies, and the title character eventually kills Tamara with his kiss. In addition to writing The Demon, he also wrote a novel in which the title character pursues Kazbich, who later kills his lover Bela, refuses to marry Princess Mary, and duels Grushnitsky. For 10 points, name this author of a novel about the superfluous man Pechorin, A Hero of Our Time.

answer: {Nicaragua}

Leonardo Arguello lasted only one month as president of this country, before being overthrown in a coup that Harry Truman refused to recognize. One rebel movement in this country was led by Eden Pastora, who called himself “Commandante Zero.” Louis Mena was a rogue defense minister who led a rebellion in this country, which sparked US intervention to prop up the government of Adolfo Diaz in 1912. One president of this country was assassinated by Rigoberto Perez, a local poet. In the early 20th century, the politics of this country was dominated by the Chamorro family. This country is now ruled by a democratically-elected former dictator, Daniel Ortega, and for a long time it was ruled by members of the Samoza family. For ten points, name this Latin American country home to Sandinistas and Contras.

In chapter 13 of this work, the main character is hailed as a “diplomat of business” much like Cecil Rountree after reading a paper to a convention, and in chapter 18 Howard Littlefield drags his daughter away from the protagonist’s son after seeing them dance at Ted’s party. One character accuses her husband of cheating on her, but after the protagonist argues that she is a nagging wife, Zilla agrees to allow her husband to go to Maine a week early. The main character of this novel has an affair with Tanis Judique after his best friend Paul Riesling is  incarcerated for killing his wife. At the end of this novel, the title character realizes he loves his wife Myra and eventually returns to his traditional, conformist life. For 10 points, name this novel about a real estate agent in Zenith by Sinclair Lewis.

answer: {Dorian Invasion} or {Dorian} Migration

The mythological narrative of this event begins with the exile of the sons of Heracles after their father’s death and ends with the killing of Tisamenus, grandson of Agamemnon and last of the Pelopidae. Cities founded as a result of this event traditionally divided into three tribes: Pamphyloi, Hylleis, and Dymanes. Thucydides claimed that it occurred approximately 80 years after the fall of Troy, shortly before 1200 BC. The pottery record of Sparta, however, indicates a date closer to 900 BC, and it likely caused the Ionian migration that founded Greek-speaking states in Asia Minor. For ten points, name this key event in the history of Dark Age Greece, a large-scale migration of a distinct ethnic and linguistic group from which Sparta traced the beginning of its occupation of the Peloponnese and the origin of its tense relations with the Ionian polis of Athens.

answer: {power sets}

Unlike Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, Kripke-Platek set theory does not have the axiom of infinity or the one named for this object, although it is still possible to prove the existence of Cartesian products in Kripke-Platek set theory, which is usually done in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory by using the axiom which constructs this object. In automata theory, constructing an equivalent deterministic finite automaton from a given nondeterministic finite automaton with set of states Q involves performing this operation on Q and using the result as the new set of states for the deterministic finite automaton. Cantor's diagonalization argument can be generalized to show that the cardinality of this object is strictly greater than the cardinality of the object it is constructed from. For a finite set with n elements, this object has 2 to the n elements. For 10 points, name this set of all subsets of a given set.

answer: Stephen F. {Austin}

The contract that this man inherited from his father stated that all of the people he recruited had to be Catholic, though he was able to coach them with essentially fraudulent oaths that satisfied his legal duty as empresario. Lucas Alaman, the foreign minister in the junta that followed the downfall of Vicente Guerrero, opposed this man with the Law of April 6th, 1830, which this man successfully had overturned.  Subsequent revisions of that law finally drove this man to back the rebellion of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna in the hope of retaining the concessions he received for recruiting American immigrants, but Santa Anna became a federalist and this man finally supported  independence from Mexico. This man lost his country’s first presidential election to the hero of the Battle of San Jacinto, Sam Houston. For ten points, name this founder of anglo Texas, the capital of which is named for him.
