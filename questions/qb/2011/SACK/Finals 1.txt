answer: The {Virgin} and {Chancellor Rolin} (accept {Madonna} of {Chancellor Rolin} and {variants}; accept {Autun Altarpiece} until “{Autun}” is {said})

In one corner of this painting are capitals bearing reliefs of the sacrifice of Cain and Abel and of the expulsion from Paradise. In the middle ground of this painting, two figures, meant to represent the viewer, appear with their backs turned, standing at a ramparted balustrade in a garden. They gaze at a stylized vista of either Bruges or Autun, in which an architecturally perfect Gothic cathedral is depicted along with an arched bridge and a castle on an island in the river. The foreground of this painting is an Italian-style marble-floored loggia in which a red-draped, bejeweled Madonna displays the holy child for adoration by this work’s patron, a high official. For ten points, name this work which depicts  the Burgundian finance minister in a pious attitude, a masterpiece by Jan Van Eyck.

answer: {Sierra Nevada}

One mountain range called this includes the Pico de Orizaba, the third-highest peak in North America. That range is volcanic and dormant, as is the range by this name that straddles the border of Chile and Argentina. By contrast, another range by this name arose during the Alpine Orogeny at the collision zone of the African and Eurasian plates; the highest peak of that range is Mulhacen. The southern end of a different mountain range called this lies west of the Owens Valley and is drained by the Feather and Merced Rivers. That range was formed after comparatively recent volcanism on the western margin of the Basin and Range caused the upthrust of an eponymous batholith. For ten points, give this name that the range containing Mount Lyell and Mount Whitney shares with others once contained in the Spanish empire, whose name means “snowy mountain range.”

answer: The {Moon} and {Sixpence}

In chapter 12 of this work, one character calls another an “unmitigated cad” after learning that his friend does not care about his children, and in another part of this work, the narrator tells a woman the story of a Jewish surgeon named Abraham. One character is slapped in the face after following his wife on a shopping trip. This work’s protagonist leaves his wife and children and stays at a friend’s home, where he carries on an affair with Blanche, the wife of that friend Dirk Stroeve. Tiare gives Ata to the protagonist as a wife even though he is already married to Amy, whom he leaves at the beginning of the novel to take up painting. At the end of this novel, the main character dies of leprosy while living in Tahiti. For 10 points, name this novel about Charles Strickland, a stockbroker-turned-painter modeled after Paul Gauguin, a work of William Somerset Maugham.

answer: {Varangians}

The earliest polity thought to have based its power on these people’s military and economic prowess is the Rus Khaganate, which emerged in the ninth century either at present-day Kiev or, more likely according to recent archaeological findings, along the Volkhov upstream of Lake Ladoga. One theory of Russian religious history points to these people as the means by which the self-sacrificing priest-king entered the Russian pagan pantheon shortly before the spread of Christianity, a transplant from the Norse Odin. Basil II’s alliance with the Rus led to his forming an elite unit comprised of these people, and the Greece Runestones, found in numerous locations in Sweden, memorialize those who died as Byzantine mercenaries. For ten points, give the name for these Scandinavian traders and warriors who were powerful in medieval Russia and whose namesake guard fell to Alp Arslan’s Turks at the Battle of Manzikert.

answer: the {doxology} [accept: “For {thine} is the {Kingdom}, the {Power}, and the {Glory}, {Now} and {Forever}” or “The {Kingdom}, the {Power}, and the {Glory} are {Yours}, {Forever} and {Ever}”, or other {clear equivalents/translations}]

During the reign of Charles I, Archbishop Laud added this phrase to the Book of Common Prayer. Jesus is quoted as saying this phrase in the Book of Mormon, but whether the original text of the gospels quotes Jesus as saying this phrase is disputed. The first indisputable mention of this phrase is in a 2nd century text called the “Didache,” or “Teaching of the Twelve Apostles”, from which it may have been interpolated into the Byzantine type text of the gospels. During a Catholic mass, after the priest recites the Embolism, this phrase is said by both the priest and the congregation. This line is notably absent from the oldest manuscripts of Matthew 6:13, where one of Jesus’s followers asks how to pray. For ten points, give the name of or recite this sentence that Protestants, but not Catholics, add to the end of the Lord’s Prayer, which praises the might and majesty of God.

answer: {Nelson Rockefeller}

Among this man’s official accomplishments was consolidating state power over public transit through the creation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a move that was possible because the strongest potential opposition to it would have come from a lawsuit by bond-holders, and their leader was this man’s brother. Over-crowding was one cause of the Attica Prison riot in 1971, and that was a result of this man’s harsh anti-drug policies. This man’s second marriage is thought to be the reason that Barry Goldwater won the Republican nomination in 1964, and he commissioned Man at the Crossroads from Diego Rivera. For many decades, this man’s name was attached to the moderate wing of the Republican Party. For ten points, name this four-term Governor of New York and one-term Vice President under Ford.

answer: Patrick {White}

One character created by this author has a brief relationship with the cellist Moraitis after rejecting the materialistic Huntly Clarkson and initially believes her house Meroë is the center of the world. In addition to writing about Theodora Goodman in The Aunt’s Story, this author also wrote a novel in which the protagonist carries on relationships with Nance Lightfoot and Hero Pavloussis, neither of which last because of Hurtle Duffield’s immense dedication to his art. In another novel by this author, the title character derives his vision of foreign lands from the landscapes of Sidney Nolan and is accompanied by the poet Frank Le Mesurier. At the end of that novel, the protagonist and Laura Trevelyan have simultaneous visions of each other as the explorer is dying. For 10 points, name this author of The Vivisector and Voss, a writer from Australia.

answer: Oliver {Heaviside}

This physicist developed a pair of linear differential equations characterizing how the current and voltage of a transmission line varies with time. Aside from the Telegrapher’s equations, he also reduced Maxwell’s equations from twenty equations to four and developed vector analysis. Along with Lorentz, he lends his name to a set of units used in relativistic calculations that eliminates a factor of two times the square root of pi, and he also coined the terms “conductance”and “impedance.” The integral of the Dirac Delta function is this man’s namesake “step” function, and along with Kennelly, he predicted the existence of one of the layers of the ionosphere. For ten points, identify this British physicist who applied Laplace transforms to the study of electrical circuits

answer: {Baldassare Castiglione}

In this man’s last diplomatic post, he answered the justification for the Sack of Rome offered by Alfonso de Valdes by writing that any violent interference with the church constituted heresy and inviting Valdes to depart Valladolid for Germany. That letter also defended Pope Clement VII’s  anti-Imperial policies, which as a court advisor to Clement this papal nuncio had counseled against. In publicly defending his master against the propaganda of Charles V’s associate Valdes, this man was living up to the standard of sprezzatura  he described in his contemporaneously published book. That book uses the device of a conversation at the court of the Duke of Urbino to characterize the ideal of Renaissance public life. For ten points, name the author of The Book of the Courtier, the subject of a famous portrait by Raphael.

answer: {Georges Perec}

This author wrote Experimental demonstration of the Tomatotopic organization in the Soprano, a satirical academic publication of an experiment in which 105 sopranos were subjected to controlled pelting with rotten tomatoes. This man’s most famous work follows Bartlebooth, an eccentric amateur water-colorist, who concocts a time-consuming plan to create and then destroy a series of paintings that his neighbor Gaspard Winckler turns into jigsaw puzzles. “E” is the only vowel in this man’s novella Les revenentes; by contrast,  La disparition does not use the letter. Those are examples of “controlled writing,” as is the aforementioned most famous work, which recounts stories associated with every room in a Paris apartment building, 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier, each story appearing in the order of a knight’s tour and using either one or two elements from each of a series of lists at the back of the book. For ten points, name this member of the Oulipo Group, the author of Life: A User’s Manual.

answer: {Opacity} (accept “{absorption coefficient}” before (*))

The guillotine factor and the Gaunt factors are correction terms used in calculating this quantity for the bound-free and free-free absorption that occurs in stellar atmospheres. The most common wavelength-independent method of calculating this quantity for a star is known as the Rosseland mean. Any star that has the functional form of this quantity, given by density multiplied by temperature to the negative seven-halves power, is said to follow a law for this quantity named after Kramers. At a given wavelength, this quantity is equal to one over the product of mean free path and wavelength. For ten points, name this quantity often used in the study of stellar atmospheres that is also known as the (*) absorption coefficient and is the cross-section of absorbing photons at a given wavelength per unit mass.

In one work, this man critically analyzes novels by Abdoulaye Sadji and Mayotte Capecia. That book criticizes Mannoni’s theory of a dependency complex existing among the Malagasy before colonization, and cites Sartre’s Anti-Semite and Jew to compare the experience of the Jews with that of blacks. Sartre wrote that “violence can heal the wounds that it has inflicted” in a preface to another of this man’s books, in which this man warns against new nations trying to imitate Europe and argues that the rural lumpenproletariat of the colonies is the only native independent enough of the Europeans to lead a successful revolt. For 10 points, name this Martiniquen author of Black Skin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth.

answer: {Pwyll}

This man's son appeared in a silk brocaded coverlet at the door of a man whose mare foaled every year but then had its foal abducted by a beast with a giant claw. Teyrnon and his wife then named that son of this man Gwri Golden-Hair. This man crashes the wedding of Hyfaidd Hen's daughter and Clud's son by dressing as a beggar and asking the groom for enough food to fill his magic bag; he eventually tricks Gwawl into becoming the first victim of  the game of Badger-in-a-Bag. The murder of Hafgan concluded an adventure which started with him hunting in Glyn Cuch, where he came upon the white-bodied, red-eared hounds of Arawn. This Prince of the seven cantrefs of Dyfed first saw his future wife riding a white horse; that wife would later marry Manawydan. For 10 points, name this subject of the first branch of the Mabinogion, the father of Pryderi and the husband of Rhiannon.

answer: {Massalia} (accept {Massilia} [the {Roman} name] or {Marseille} before it is mentioned)

Settlers from Phocaea founded this city around 600 BC at the harbor site of Lacydon. Its trade links with the interior contributed to the development of the native Hallstatt and La Tène cultures in the sixth century BC, in which  Attic black figure vases are found in elite burial plots. The city itself competed unsuccessfully with Carthage for trade with Tartessus. An early ally of Rome in its region, the late-Republican wine trade through this city was a likely reason for Rome’s success in the Gallic Wars, since competitive slaving among the Gauls to pay for Italian wine contributed to the difficulty they had uniting against the eventual Roman conquest. Agricola was among the Roman elite who received an education at this center for Greek learning in the west. For ten points, name this Greek emporion and Roman city, the site of modern Marseille.
