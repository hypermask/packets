answer: Henry Purcell

One of this composer’s works opens with the sacrifice of a “milk-white steed” to Woden, and later Cupid sings “In spite of cold weather, I’ve brought you together” as part of a play-within-a-play. That occurs in this composer’s collaboration with John Dryden, who wrote the libretto to that semi-opera, King Arthur. This composer also collaborated with Nahum Tate on a full opera in which an evil sorceress, observing the title characters’ love, resolves that she can destroy the kingdom by inducing one of them to believe he has a city to found elsewhere. The witch correctly predicts that the abandoned lover will die of grief, which she does after singing the aria “When I am laid in Earth.” For ten points, name this English composer, creator of Abdelazer and Dido and Aeneas.

answer: An {Ideal Husband}

One character in this work states that “to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,” after his butler presents him with a buttonhole. Two women visit the title character’s home, and Lady Markby leaves to visit another friend. In Act III, one character is belittled and encouraged to marry by his father Lord Caversham. The protagonist of this work is blackmailed into supporting another character’s Argentine canal scheme but later denounces it. That causes Mrs. Cheveley to secretly threaten to send a pink letter to the title character disguised as a love letter from his wife to Lord Goring, but her plan is later revealed. For 10 points, name this play in which Sir Robert Chiltern thwarts attempts to break up his marriage and eventually reconciles with his wife, a work of Oscar Wilde.

answer: {quantum entanglement} [prompt on “{EPR Paradox}” or “{EPR effect}” before {being} mentioned]

If this property holds in a system, the total von Neumann entropy may be less than the sum of its components. This property was explained away in a thought experiment that promoted a hidden variable theory of physics by showing that information must travel faster than light or violate locality, the “spooky action at a distance” in the words of one of that experiment’s formulators. Experiments by Aspect and others have confirmed this property’s existence by violating Bell’s inequalities, which should be followed if a hidden variable that Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen predicted exists. For 10 points, name this relation between particles where the description of one cannot be known without also knowing the other.

answer: {Giovanni’s Room}

One character in this novel remembers splitting a bag of cherries with the title character. A group of men in this novel have a drink with Madame Clothilde, after which the two central characters leave to have wine and oysters. Earlier in this novel one character lends another ten thousand francs, which the protagonist offers the title character at a bar. After seeking out prostitutes, the protagonist eventually sleeps with Sue to convince himself of his masculinity and later finds out that the title character had been fired by Guillaume. This novel ends on the morning of the title character’s execution, when Hella leaves the protagonist after surmising that he is a homosexual, leaving her fiancé David without either of his lovers. For 10 points, name this novel in which David carries on an affair with the titular Italian man in Paris, a work by James Baldwin.

answer: Roland {Barthes}

In this man’s last lectures, collected as “The  Preparation of the Novel,” this writer compared himself to Proust, noting that both were prompted to turn from introspection to novelizing by the deaths of their mothers. This author thus defined the novel as “any work in which egotism is transcended.” This author analyzed the cover of an issue of Paris Match that featured a saluting black soldier in a French military uniform as an example of the process of myth-making. Another work of criticism by this author discusses Mallarmé, Valery, and Proust as writers who tried to effect the title action; in that work this man rejected the idea of a single intended meaning, the uncovering of which is the object of reading. For ten points, name this French novelist and literary critic, the author of Mythologies and The Death of the Author.

answer: Vandals

The bishop Deogratias purchased and then freed slaves captured by these people, according to Victor of Vita, who was one chronicler of the persecution of their Christian subjects. One of these people quoted the Hebrew scripture “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity” upon being led into the hippodrome in Constantinople as part of a triumph. That occurred after he sent his brother Tzazo to put down the rebellion of Goddas and was subsequently left without enough of an army to successfully defend Ad Decimum. A more famous act of these people was supposedly motivated by the pleas of Licinia Eudoxia, who requested their aid following Maximus' murder of her husband Valentinian III. Pope Leo's negotiations with these people were not as effective as they had been with the Huns, however. For 10 points, name these Germanic people led by Gelimer and Gaiseric, who established a kingdom in Africa and led a particularly destructive sack of Rome in 455 AD.

answer: {prime} (accept {prime ideals} or {prime numbers})

The set of all of these is denoted Spec R, where R is a commutative ring and can be made into a topological space via the Zariski topology. An integral domain results from taking the quotient of a ring with one of these kinds of ideals, which shows that every maximal ideal has this property as well. There are arbitrarily long arithmetic sequences of these by the Green-Tao theorem, and minus one is congruent to n minus one factorial mod n if and only if n is one of these, according to Wilson's theorem. Carmichael numbers do not have this property, despite passing a test based on Fermat's Little theorem. Adding one to the product of all of these is the key idea of Euclid's proof that there must be an infinite number of these kinds of numbers, which come in Germain and Mersenne varieties. For 10 points, name this kind of number which has no proper factors other than one.

answer: Martin {Heidegger}

In one essay, this philosopher distinguished between the Greek words “aitia” and “poiesis” and illustrated the four traditional modes of causality using the example of a silver chalice before asserting that enframing rather than instrumentality is the essence of technology. Derrida discussed this philosopher and “the Question” in Of Spirit. This man noted that angst is a sign of authenticity, and described his most famous concept in terms of thrown-ness and fallen-ness. His shift of focus from ontology to art and language is known as “the Turn,” and he is notorious for his address at Freiburg, “The Self-Assertion of the German University.” For 10 points, what German philosopher discussed Dasein in Being and Time?

answer: {Cistercian}

Mellifont was one example of this architectural style, a severe and reactionary version of Burgundian Romanesque. This style’s distinguishing characteristics are a rectilinear plan with a square presbytery and a two-tiered nave with no clerestory and chapels opening to the east of the transept. The exterior view has been called “Hohenstaffelung,” referring to the fact that churches built in this style have the appearance of a steadily-rising mass, from low chapels to transept to dominant nave. Constructions in this style often include mills and forges due to their typically remote location. The most complete extant example of this style is Fontenay, and its orthodox form is also called “Bernardine.” Famous ruined examples include Fountains, Rievaulx, and Tintern. For ten points, what is this style of monastic architecture found originally at Clairvaux?

One of the supplemental essays appended to this work explains the role of the laws of association in “The Function of Imagery in Conduct.” This work contrasts between a dog protecting his bone and a man saying “This is my property,” and argues that games allow organized personality to be possible by establishing the role of “the generalized other.” It was edited by Charles Morris, and like The Philosophy of the Present and The Philosophy of the Act, this work was published posthumously based on the author’s lectures at the University of Chicago. According to this work, self-consciousness distinguishes between significant gestures and non-significant gestures. For 10 points, the second title concept consists of the individual “I” and the social “me” in what work of social behaviorism by George Herbert Mead?

answer: {Phagocytosis}

This process can be triggered by molecules like phosphatidylserine.  Some organisms try to avoid this process by using a slime layer or fimbriae. Another way to avoid this process is via protein A, which blocks IgG binding and opsonization. After undergoing this process, some organisms use molecules like sulfatides to avoid encountering acidic conditions, while others use proteins such as listeriolysin O or phospholipase A to avoid death by breaking out of the vacuole that they are sequestered in. Pathogens that aren’t so lucky are broken down by the cell that performed this process in an oxygen dependent manner. Cells that do this “professionally” include neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages. For 10 points, name this process in which a cell internalizes solid particles.

answer: Kansas

A notorious act of political violence in this state occurred when a mounted band of semi-official vigilantes charged down Mount Oread and into the stronghold of Senator James Lane, killing 183 unarmed men and burning the town. The present constitution of this state was known as the Wyandotte Constitution when first adopted, and it was drafted after an earlier proposal, put to a violent and fraudulent referendum, alienated the “popular sovereignty” faction of the Democratic party led by Stephen Douglas when President Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution. That followed the first sacking of Lawrence in 1856; Quantrill’s Raid of 1863 was the second. For ten points, what is this US state, site of the Pottawatomie Creek Massacre and other bloody conflict over whether slavery should be legal?

answer: Caspar David {Friedrich} (accept “A {Walk} at {Dusk}” before (*))

A single figure dressed in red stands in the left foreground, contemplating the megalithic tomb in the center, in this (*) man’s A Walk at Dusk.  One work inspired by this artist’s travels through his homeland features a resting traveler stopping in front of a dark landscape.  Stormy skies dominate the upper half of the canvas, but a single arc of yellow stretches across the sky in his Mountain Landscape with Rainbow. Five years before his death, he painted a work where it is thought he himself is the old man whose back is to the viewer, and that figure heads toward his nephew, two daughters, and son.  Behind them, five ships approach the harbor at different distances, representing age and mortality. For 10 points, name this German Romanticist who painted The Stages of Life and who is known for his allegorical landscapes often relating to loneliness and death.

One of the people this character hosts in his home conducts readings of Eldridge Cleaver, and another character that lives at this man’s house becomes the object of  his son’s affections while having sex with both Skeeter and this man. That woman eventually dies in a house fire while this man is in Peggy Fosnacht’s apartment, and after Jill Pendleton’s death, this character reclaims his wife from Charlie Stavros. He moves in with Ruth Leonard, after which his wife drowns his daughter Rebecca. This man leaves his family after sleeping with his son Nelson’s wife Pru instead of facing the wrath of his wife Janice, and he eventually dies of a stroke while playing basketball with a boy he doesn’t know. This former high school basketball star lives his life as a car salesman in an unhappy marriage. For 10 points, name this protagonist of a series of novels by John Updike, a character also known as “Rabbit.”

answer: {Eleusinian Mysteries}

“Brimo has given birth to Brimos!” is one phrase associated with this event, which was overseen by the families Eumolpidai and the less-important Kerykes who nevertheless supplied the daduchos and hierokeryx, or the “torchbearer” and “herald of the sacred.” Clement of Alexandria transmitted the synthema or “password” associated with this, which begins “I fasted, I drank the kykeon, I took out the covered basket,” summarizing the process of initiation. Iacchos was an epithet of Dionysus associated with this practice. The etiology for these rites, which occurred in the month of Boedromion, is recorded in the Homeric Hymn to its central figure, who visited Celeus in the guise of Doso while searching for Kore. For 10 points, name this Greek mystery cult, centered on a town in Attica, which celebrated Triptolemus learning of agriculture from Persephone and Demeter.

answer: {regular} (accept {regular expressions} or {regular languages})

According to the Myhill-Nerode Theorem, the set on which a given Myhil-Nerode relation is defined has this property if and only if that equivalence relation has finite index. That result often gives shorter proofs than arguments based on the pumping lemma for languages with this property, which can be proven using the pigeonhole principle and the fact that automata which recognize these kinds of languages have only finitely many states and no stack. The language consisting of all strings of some number of 0’s followed by the same number of 1’s notably does not have this property. Taking the empty set, empty string and the literal characters, and closing that set under the concatenation, alternation, and Kleene star operations gives the set of expressions of this type. For 10 points, give this term that also lends its name to a type of expression that the grep Unix command searches files for.

answer: Enthalpy (prompt on {H} before mentioned)

The change in this quantity when a substance changes temperature is found by using Kirchoff’s law.  In only the case when boiling points are known, Trouton’s rule can be used to find this quantity for a liquid.  The derivative of Gibbs free energy over temperature with respect to temperature  is equal to the negative change in this quantity over temperature squared according to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. This quantity may be summed for individual reactions to find its value for the overall reaction according to Hess’s law. At constant pressure, the derivative of this quantity with respect to temperature is the heat capacity. For ten points, name this quantity equal to internal energy plus pressure times volume, often symbolized H.

One place called this is a red light district on the right bank of the Elbe. The Vila Olimpia is an upscale district of another city called this, which also features the cable-stayed Octavio Frias de Oliveira Bridge over the Pinheiros River. The Pinheiros flows into the Tietê just downstream of the bridge, and though this place is only about 20 kilometers from the coast, the Tietê flows west, where it eventually meets the Pirana. The Edificio Copan, located in that same city, is the largest residential building by square footage in the world and was designed by Oscar Niemeyer. Pig’s Eye Lake is an artificial body of water in another place called this, which also features the Fitzgerald Theater and a Cass Gilbert-designed state capitol building. For ten points, what is this place name, one of which is located at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers and another of which is the largest city in Brazil?
