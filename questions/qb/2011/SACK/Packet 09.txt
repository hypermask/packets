answer: {Bourbon} ({Bourbon Democrats} acceptable)

In Georgia, a triumvirate with this epithet consisting of Joseph Brown, Alfred Colquitt, and John B. Gordon, all former Confederate officers, dominated state politics after Redemption. Their favorable treatment of railroads was typical of this faction’s Southern manifestation, and many of its members had been Whigs before the Civil War. In national politics, this term is most closely associated with the tight monetary policy of the Cleveland administration after the Panic of 1893 and the reaction against it by the Populist movement, leading to the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan. The ultimate extinction of this term occurred when Bryan joined Woodrow Wilson’s cabinet in 1912. For ten points, what is this epithet, which refers to a faction of the Democratic party and derives either from the dynasty inaugurated by Henri IV or a kind of whiskey distilled in Kentucky?

answer: The {Ring} and the Book

The speaker of this book’s fourth chapter offers himself as a reasonable “Tertium Quid” “Between the rabble’s-brabbles of dolts and fools” that have spoken in the two chapters before it. Those chapters, “Half-Rome” and “The Other Half-Rome” give opposing opinions about the character of the man being tried, who defends himself in the fifth chapter and unrepentantly admits to the crime in the eleventh. That man is a count who killed his wife Pompilia after accusing her of cavorting with the priest Caponsacchi. In this work’s prologue, the author tells how he took “pure crude fact / Secreted from man’s life when hearts beat hard” and “fused my live soul and that inert stuff” to produce one of the title objects. For 10 points, name this poem based on the Roman murder case described in “the old Yellow Book,” a work of Robert Browning.

answer: Pedro Jaime {Martinez}

The Kelly Leak factor and Orr factor are two reasons given for this man’s induction into the Pantheon, written about in Now I Can Die in Peace.  Along with Dazzy Vance and Greg Maddux, he is one of three pitchers to lead his league in ERA by more than a run. The star of the Italian horror film Ratman  is a notable friend of this athlete, and that actor, Nelson de la Rosa, is known as his “midget.” He was traded from a team where he played alongside his brother Ramon for Delino DeShields. He has endured many chants because he once called a division rival “his daddy,” and in a 2003 Game 7, he was controversially left in to pitch with disastrous results, leading to the firing of his manager, Grady Little. He won his first Cy Young award in 1997, with the Montreal Expos. In 2009, he did not pitch until August 12, yet started Game 2 of the World Series for the Phillies. For ten points, identify this Dominican pitcher who won the the 2004 World Series with the Boston Red Sox.

answer: {Marc Antony} or {Marcus Antonius}

This man fought under Aulus Gabinius against Aristobulus II in Judaea, after he traveled to Greece, ostensibly to learn rhetoric, but more likely to escape the creditors to whom he owed 250 talents. That debt resulted from a period of youthful recklessness in which he was friends with Curio, who was later the tribune bribed by an ally of this man before this man became tribune himself in 49 BC. In one battle, after advancing his men through the marsh on his right flank, he was able to outmaneuver his enemy, causing his opponent to have his freedman Pindarus run him through. This man’s ally’s camp had been overrun, but the two still won the Battle of Philippi, where this man defeated Cassius and then Brutus. For 10 points, name this member of the second triumvirate, whose quinqueriemes were crushed at Actium by Agrippa and Octavian, and who later committed suicide alongside Cleopatra.

answer: {virial}

In statistical mechanics, coefficients described by this adjective are related to graph theory through the use of Mayer cluster integrals, and an ongoing debate exists as to whether the stress described by this adjective on the atomic level is equivalent to the Cauchy stress of macroscopic objects.  The Onnes equation is another name for the equation of state  or “expansion” described by this adjective, which can be used to find the Boyle temperature of a gas. The most well-known statement described by this adjective has been used to derive the Chandrasekhar limit for White Dwarfs. For ten points, identify this adjective, applied to a ubiquitous theorem that in its simplest form states that the average kinetic energy of a system is equal to minus one-half of the average potential energy of a system.

answer: An {Lushan} [do NOT accept An {Shi}: {this} is an acceptable {alternative} name for the {rebellion}, but not for the dude. “An {Shi}” {comes} from the {fact} that {members} of the {Shi family led} the {rebellion} after An and his {son died}]

According to legend, when this man was a youth he was caught stealing sheep, but argued his way out of being executed by promising to join the army. This man served in the Pinglu Army as a protégé of general Zhang Shougui [ read “JANG show-gway”]. This man’s rivals at court included Li Linfu and Chancellor Yang, whose appointment this man opposed. This man referred to himself and his followers as “Great Yan” and was supported by his childhood friend, Shi Siming. This man became a favorite of Yang Guifei, a mistress of the Emperor, allowing him to gain enough power to challenge the Tang dynasty. For ten points, name this Sogdian Turkish general who led a Chinese rebellion.

answer: Mexico

One artist from this country painted Three People, an abstract work in red and purple in which the forms of the three figures have a roughened surface due to the artist’s use of sand and marble in his paint. That work was discovered in a pile of trash on a New York City sidewalk in 2007. Another artist from this country depicted a writhing skeleton giving birth to a baby skeleton in academic garb while other skeletons in academic garb observe. That scene appears along with a more famous one of  a peasant getting stabbed in the back by an army officer in The Epic of American Civilization, which is located at Dartmouth College. Another artist from this country painted a history of this country in one enormous panel of conflict, all surrounding an eagle grasping a snake. For ten points, what is this country, home to Rufino Tamayo, Jose Clemente Orozco, and Diego Rivera?

answer: Theodore {Roethke}

A poem addressed to this author ends with the line “The Garden Master’s gone.” That poem, collected in Dream Songs, is by John Berryman. The title character of one of this author’s poems “loves like a gander, and adores a goose” and taught the speaker to “Turn, and Counter-turn, and stand.” This author of “I Knew a Woman” also wrote a poem in which the speaker remembers how he and another character “romped until the pans/Slid from the kitchen shelf.”  In one of his poems, the speaker exclaims “God bless the Ground!” and states that he “should know/What falls away is always. And is near.” That poem ends with the line “I learn by going where I have to go.” The speaker of another poem by this author remembers “the neckcurls, limp and damp as tendrils” in a poem about a girl “thrown from a horse.” For 10 points, name this American author of “My Papa’s Waltz,” “The Waking,” and “Elegy for Jane.”

answer: {Frederick Barbarossa} or {Frederick} I

Rahewin of Freising completed the first biography of this ruler. As a concession to Henry Jasomirgott, this ruler issued the Privilegium Minus, which created a new duchy and gave increased autonomy to Austria. One military campaign by this ruler resulted in the capture and execution of Arnold of Brescia; that campaign was this man’s destruction of the Commune of Rome, which he did at the behest of Pope Adrian IV. This ruler convened the Diet of Roncaglia, whose verdict the Lombard League did not accept since they considered it to be tantamount to the subjugation of Northern Italy. This ruler died while jumping into a river in the Third Crusade. For ten points, name this Holy Roman Emperor with a red beard.

answer: Gian Lorenzo {Bernini}

This artist painted two men in conversation, one with a book and a fish gesturing with his hand outside the painting and the other with a carpenter’s square. That work is his Saints Andrew and Thomas.  This man was invited by King Louis XIV to submit designs for the east facade of the Louvre, but those were ultimately rejected. One of his architectural works has twice-life-size angels standing atop four spiral columns and is a baldacchino. In one of his sculptures, a man chases a woman whose arms are raised and legs are turning into a tree trunk, while in another, a saint receives a spiritual spear-thrust from a hovering angel. For 10 points, name this Baroque sculptor of the Fountain of the Four Rivers, Apollo and Daphne and Ecstasy of Saint Theresa, as well as the final version of St. Peter’s Basilica.

answer: {X-Rays}

Red Giants give off very little light in this region and thus emissions in this region can be used to test “Dividing Line” models that separate giant stars from Red Giants. The star Eta Carinae emits unusually strong radiation in this region, and observations of the star in this region of the spectrum have revealed a complex nebular structure. The radiation from black holes circled by accretion disks comes primarily in this band, as does most of the radiation from the corona of the Sun. Due to the opacity of the Earth’s atmosphere, most observations in this band occur in high-altitude balloons or through space-based telescopes such as Chandra and EXOSAT. For ten points, name this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that lies between the Ultraviolet and Gamma Ray bands.

answer: The {Blind Assassin}

One character in this novel is accused of burning down a factory and is harbored in the attic of the central family, and another character is revealed to have corresponded with the director of Bella Vista. One character in this work is killed during World War II after fathering Aimee, who is given to Winifred after her mother is caught meeting a man in a motel. Some notebooks of one of this work’s main characters reveal that Richard was the father of her child, and shortly after learning of the death of Alex Thomas, that character commits suicide by driving off a bridge. The title of this novel refers to a work Laura Chase is said to have written before her suicide, which punctuates Iris Chase’s newspaper clipping-filled narrative. For 10 points, name this work in which the title novel is revealed to actually have been written by Iris, a work by Margaret Atwood.

answer: {Hephaestus} ({take} “{Ptah}” until mention of {Hyginus}, and “{Vulcan}” until mention of {Homer})

According to Herodotus, the dwarfish statues of Pataikos which Phoenicians placed on their triremes' prows were similar to statues of this figure. In Hyginus' list of kings of Athens, Erichthonius was said to be the son of this figure. According to Homer, the youngest of the Charites, Algaia, is the wife of this figure, whose children by other women included Pericletes, a club-bearing robber killed by Theseus, and the aforementioned Erichthonius who was conceived by Gaia after this figure's failed rape of Athena. All this supposedly occurred after his divorce from his original wife whom he caught cheating in an inescapable net. He also trapped his mother with an inescapable golden throne in revenge for the wounds suffered after landing on Lemnos after falling for days when he was cast out of Olympus. For 10 points, name this ugly husband of Aphrodite, the lame son of Hera whose forge was said to be located below Mount Aetna.

answer: {p53}

EBNA1 can compete with this protein to bind with USP7, an enzyme that stabilizes this protein. This protein is activated by phosphorylation of its N terminal domain and upon activation, this protein’s half-life increases and it undergoes a conformational change that allows it to act as a transcription regulator. In unstressed cells, Mdm2 binds to this protein and transports it to the cytosol, where it causes this protein to be marked for degradation. An autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in this gene, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, leads to an increased susceptibility to cancer. In cells affected by stressors such as membrane damage or oxidative stress, this protein upregulates DNA repair proteins through p21 or, in unrepairable cases, causes the cell to undergo apoptosis. For 10 points, name this “guardian of the genome” that is instrumental in preventing cancer.

In Drautzburg and Uhlig’s model of this, the length of time that the Zero Lower Bound is binding is a critical determinant of the effectiveness of this tool, and those authors conclude that the multiplier associated with this is less than one. Barro argued that this tool can never be effective since a government that sells its debt to its own citizens, to be repaid by taxing them or their children, cannot add to the overall wealth in the economy. That argument is ostensibly drawn from David Ricardo, though he himself doubted its empirical validity. This tool was most famously advocated by Keynes as a means to smooth fluctuations in aggregate demand. For ten points, what is this field of economic policy related to government spending and taxation, the debate over which was reinvigorated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act?
