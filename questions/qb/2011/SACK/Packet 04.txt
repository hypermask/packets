answer: {Tigris} River

It was a flood of this river, as well as his non-existence, that prevented the Nestorian king-priest Prester John from capturing Jerusalem from the Saracens according to the medieval legend about him. The Ilisu Dam is a controversial project proposed to be built on this river at the border of Sirnak and Mardin provinces. If constructed, it would flood the archaeological site at Hasankeyf, an ancient ford of this river. The low-lying flats of this river nourish the stupendous watermelons of Diyarbakir. Saddam Hussein’s hometown is named after this river, and the ancient capitals of Seleucia and Ctesiphon are built on opposite sides of this river, 35 kilometers south of the modern capital of Baghdad. For ten points, name the eastern one of the rivers that define Mesopotamia, which forms the Shatt-al-Arab when it joins the Euphrates.

answer: {proton(s)}

A recent study published in Nature obtained a value for the root-mean-squared charge radius of this particle that was roughly five standard deviations away from the currently accepted value. CERN utilizes Penning traps to confine this particle’s antiparticle and when this particle decays, a pion and a positron should be produced, though that has never been observed. That is unsurprising since the experimental half-life of this particle is on the order of 10-to-the-33rd-power years and this particle’s decay may be impossible. This particle is composed of two up quarks and one down quark, and the number of these particles in an atom is equal to the atomic number. For ten points, identify this positively charged particle found in the nucleus along with the neutron.

answer: {Impeachment} and {Conviction}

Warning: two answers required. The State Treasurer of Georgia suffered this in 1879 after he absconded with over $400,000 in state funds. John Pickering, the district judge for New Hampshire whom national Republicans accused of absenteeism and drunkenness, was the first federal official to be the target of this in 1804. Three other federal judges have been the targets of this two-part procedure in more recent times: Alcee Hastings, who was actually acquitted in a criminal court of receiving bribes in exchange for a lenient sentence, Walter Nixon, who interfered in the state prosecution of his law partner’s son, and, in 2010, Thomas Porteous, who accepted bribes from numerous individuals who appeared before him. For ten points, what is this two-part procedure that requires a majority vote in the House and a two-thirds vote in the US Senate and results in the target’s removal from public office?

answer: A {House} for {Mr. Biswas}

A note reading “I love you and I want to talk to you” is intercepted and interpreted as a marriage proposal in this novel, which the title character regrets having made immediately thereafter and for the rest of his life. The title character’s in-laws include the “gods” Owad and Shekhar, who are always fed fish in the family compound, while the other children get only rice. That title character inadvertently causes his father’s death by drowning; later in the book, a similar series of events results in the near-drowning of his own son Anand, the author’s alter-ego, who ends up earning a scholarship to study in England. For ten points, what is this novel of an endlessly frustrated Trinidadian journalist married into the domineering Tulsi clan, who accomplishes his life goal only under disadvantageous circumstances, a work of V.S. Naipaul?

answer: {Stephen Dedalus} [accept either]

In one book, this character decides to quit his job at Mr. Deasy’s school and is found drunk in the street by that book’s protagonist. As a child, this man read a poem in Doctor Cornwall’s Spelling Book about cancer and cankers, which he remembers while lying in the sick bay at Clongowes. While there, Brother Michael tells this character about the death of Parnell, whom his aunt had supported until the revelation of his affair. Years later, this character goes to university in Dublin where he writes a villanelle whose repeating lines are “Tell me no more of enchanted days” and “Are you not weary of ardent ways?” and decides to leave for Paris. For 10 points, name this character from Ulysses and protagonist of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.

answer: William Graham {Sumner}

Noah Porter nearly forced this leader of the Young Yale movement to resign. This proponent of free trade called protectionism “The –Ism Which Teaches That Waste Makes Wealth,” and he noted that the adoption of imperialism might result in “The Conquest of America by Spain.” He argued that the formula “A and B decide what C shall be made to do for D” describes the exploitation of the Forgotten Man. He praised laissez-faire policy and warned against state interventionism in What Social Classes Owe Each Other. In his most famous work, he discusses in-group and others-group before introducing the term ethnocentrism. For 10 points, name this sociologist who discussed the evolutionary process through which mores and other social norms develop in Folkways.

answer: {Ubiquitin}

In eukaryotes, the genes that encode this protein are arranged in tandem repeats, and this protein is thought to regulate gene transcription by binding to histone H2A. The attachment of this protein to its target is mediated by a hierarchical three enzyme cascade that starts with an E1 activating protein and ends with a substrate specific E3 ligase. This protein uses a glycine residue to bind to a lysine residue on the target protein and can tag a transmembrane protein for removal from a membrane or bind to cyclin to regulate cell division. Its most well known function occurs when a chain of at least four of these molecules attaches to a target, which directs target proteins to the proteasome. For 10 points, name this abundant protein that is used to target other proteins for degradation.

answer: {Nathanael West}

A character in one of this author’s short stories is haunted by the memory of losing a fly ball during a baseball game. In addition to writing that story about F. Winslow, “Western Union Boy,” this author wrote a novel in which the title character orgasms after discarding the stories of some authors he meets inside the rectum of the Trojan Horse. As well as authoring The Dream Life of Balso Snell, this man wrote a novel in which Tod Hackett becomes obsessed with Faye Greener, who relies on Homer Simpson for support. The title character of one of his novels imagines himself as the ivory Christ in his bedroom and is shot after stretching out his arms to embrace Doyle. That character had earlier quit his job as a columnist who gives love advice in the New York Dispatch. For 10 points, name this author of The Day of the Locust and Miss Lonelyhearts.

answer: {rearrangement} reactions

One reaction of this type is an important step in a procedure for elongating a carboxylic acid that is named for Arndt-Eistert. That reaction of this type creates ketenes from acyl carbenes and is named for Wolff.  These reactions are often triggered by cations, as in the Wagner-Meerwein type of these reactions. One of these types of reactions results in the formation of an isocyanate from an acyl azide when the reaction mixture is heated and is named for Curtius.  Carbonyl groups can be formed from diols in the pinacol reaction of this type. One of these reactions named for Whitmore is a 1,2-hydride shift, and a 1,5-diene undergoes one of these reactions that involves a concerted pericyclic mechanism.. For ten points, identify this type of reactions that includes tautomerizations and create a structural isomer, one of which is named for Cope.

answer: The {Birth} of {Tragedy} from the Spirit of Music

This work illustrates the layer of “mere appearances” by analyzing Raphael’s Transfiguration. It calls the metaphysical comfort of eternal life the “Buddhistic” stage of illusion, and it argues that maxims like “virtue is knowledge” and “he who is virtuous is happy” killed the title entity. The author of this text rejects the “ideal spectator” theory of Schlegel. It quotes often from The World as Will and Representation, and its foreword declares that “art is the truly metaphysical activity” and is addressed to Richard Wagner. The author attacks Euripides for destroying the balance of the Dionysian and the Apollonian in, for 10 points, what work that discusses the spirit of music in Greek art, written by Friedrich Nietzsche?

answer: {Celiac} disease

Tests for this disease include measurements of  tTGA and AEA levels. The diagnostic biopsy for this disease is analyzed using the Marsh classification, which divides this disease into four stages based on factors like number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes and villous atrophy. Risk factors for this disease include being born by C-section, a finding that correlates with the finding that the makeup of the fecal microflora in patients suffering from this disease differs significantly than that of control subjects. A more serious risk factor is type 1 diabetes, which like this disease is caused by autoreactive T cells. Stage four of this disease is characterized by hypoplasia of the architecture of the small bowel. For 10 points, name this disease that is treated with a gluten free diet.

answer: {salat} or {salah}({prompt} on “prayer” or “Muslims {praying}” or “{Islamic} prayer” early)

This practice is credited with keeping one away from shameful and unjust deeds, according to verse 45 of The Spider. Namaz is the name given to it in Urdu. Al Ma'ida and An Nisa require travelers to perform tayammum prior to this action, which replaces ghusl or wudhu, because it uses sand or clean earth. It is forbidden to menstruating women because they are unable to achieve taharah. Jumu'ah is one example of this which replaces dhurh on Friday, and it occurs after the adhan is delivered by a muezzin. Jumu’ah is shortened to only two raka'at because it is followed by a khutbah or sermon. For 10 points name this action which must be proceeded by ritual ablution and performed 5 times daily, the second pillar of Islam, a term which refers to the prayer of Muslims.

answer: {Lord Chancellor}

The last holder of this office to have any power as a result was Charles Falconer, who left office in 2007. This office was held by such men as William of Wykeham, who clashed with John of Gaunt during his tenure in this office at the end of Edward III’s reign and beginning of Richard II’s. Thomas Becket held this office, but he largely neglected it to focus on consolidating power and revenue under his other position of authority, Archbishop of Canterbury. A similar prejudice toward ecclesiastical wealth and power colored the tenure of Thomas Wolsey in this office, the chief symbol of which, the Great Seal of the Realm, he surrendered in 1529, after presiding over the expansion of the Court of Star Chamber in performance of this office. For ten points, name this great office of state, held after Wolsey by Saint Thomas More, who used it to burn both Protestant books and the heretics who wrote them.

answer: {hyperbolic} (accept any answer with the word {hyperbolic})

All closed irreducible atoroidal 3-manifolds with infinite fundamental group admit this type of metric by Thurston's geometrization conjecture. Mostow rigidity states that given a homotopy equivalence f between closed manifolds of this type with dimension greater than 2, f is homotopic to an isometry. This type of manifold has constant negative curvature -1 and has as its universal cover this type of space. Models of this space include the Klein model and the Poincaré half-plane model. In this type of space, given any line l and point p not on l, there are infinitely many lines passing through p and not intersecting l, and the three angles in a triangle always sum up to less than 180 degrees. Bolyai and Lobachevsky were pioneers of this type of geometry. For 10 points, name this non-Euclidean geometry, whose construction proved the parallel postulate to be independent of the other axioms of Euclid.

answer: “Death of the {Hired Man}”

This poem’s title character has “...nothing to look backward to with pride, / And nothing to look forward to with hope.” However, he has never asked for help from his bank director brother, who lives just thirteen miles from where he works. One of the speakers in this poem remembers the title character working with Harold Wilson, a college student who “studied Latin like the violin / Because he liked it” but does not believe in the title character’s divining skills. He and Harold spent the summer bundling hay, which is his “one accomplishment,” and he told one of this poem’s speakers that he had returned to help ditch the meadows. That character is Mary, whose husband Warren announces Silas’s death at this poem’s end. For 10 points, name this poem that is mostly dialogue between Warren and Mary, a work of Robert Frost about the demise of the title character.
