answer: {Numidians}

The sons of Micipsa, Hiemspal and Adherbal, were two of these people. The former was murdered, after which the latter sought help from Lucius Opimius. King Bocchus of Mauretania betrayed one leader of these people that Quintus Caecilius Metellus had been unable to defeat, and a half century later they fought alongside the Optimates at the Battle of Thapsus. At that battle they were under the command of Juba. The first king of these people fought alongside the Romans at the Battle of Zama against Hannibal's Carthaginians. Sallust described a war with a notable leader of these people, who was eventually defeated by Gaius Marius and his quaestor Lucius Cornelius Sulla. For 10 points, name these ancient Berber people with capital at Cirta who were allies of Rome under Masinissa and warred with Rome under Jugurtha.

answer: Elias James {Corey} (Accept “{Seebach}” until “enantioselectively”)

One reaction named for this man permits an inversion of the normal reactivity of acyl carbon atoms, which combine only with nucleophiles, in a phenomenon known as umpolung.  He is the first namesake of another reaction in which an achiral ketone is enantioselectively reduced to produce the corresponding chiral, non-racemic alcohol. He controversially claimed that he inspired the development of the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, and he won a Nobel Prize for pioneering a method of transforming a molecule into simple precursor structures, retrograde analysis. The earlier mentioned reactions are co-named with Seebach and with Bakshi and Shibata. For ten points, name this man who names a reaction that transforms aldehydes into alkynes along with Fuchs.

answer: Simon {Bolivar}

After this man’s death, his personal papers were organized by his aide, Daniel O’Leary, who also wrote a thirty-four volume history of this man’s military career. This man received weapons from Alexandre Petion and allied himself with the Belgian merchant Luis Brion, who supplied this man with ships. That support allowed this man and a band of exiled soldiers to make a successful amphibious landing at Los Cayos. General Soublette was one of this man’s most important deputies. This man’s first military offensive is called the “Admirable Campaign”, which failed. This man’s “Decree of War to the Death” helped him defeat Field Marshal de la Torre after returning from Jamaica, where he wrote a notable letter. For ten points, name this victor of the Battles of Carabobo and Boyaca, the liberator of South America.

answer: {Sean O’Casey}

In one play by this author, a man and his friend practice the song “Down Where the Bees are Humming” for a show, and another of his plays recreates Everyman from the perspective of The Young Woman, whom The Dreamer tries to save from prostitution. In addition to writing The End of the Beginning and Within the Gates, this author wrote a play in which Bessie Burgess is shot while trying to pull Nora Clitheroe from the window after finding out that her husband Jack was killed. In another one of his works, the dysfunctional Boyle family squanders a mythical inheritance in a Dublin slum during the Irish Civil War. For 10 points, name this author of The Plow and the Stars and Juno and the Paycock.

answer: {Bicycle Thieves} or {Ladri di biciclette} or The {Bicycle Thief}

One character whines, “I mind my own business, I bother nobody, and what do I get? Trouble.”  This film opens with the main character’s name being called until his friend retrieves him from sitting across the street on the road, ultimately causing the protagonist’s wife to pawn their bedsheets.  At one point this film’s main character runs after a kid into a brothel to exact revenge, only to have that kid feign a seizure and cause the neighbors to jeer at him.  This film’s main character is spared charges because he is pitied for being slapped in the face many times in front of his young son, Bruno.  The main conflict comes when the protagonist, Antonio Ricci, in desperate need of work, gets a job putting up posters but is told that he must have the titular item or no job.  For 10 points, name this 1948 Italian neorealist film by Vittorio De Sica about a certain stolen vehicle.

answer: Treaty of {Westphalia}

During this treaty’s negotiation, one famous participant wrote a letter to his son stating “behold, with how little wisdom the world is ruled!” As part of this treaty, France gained suzerainty, but not actual rule, over an alliance of ten cities called the “Decapole,” which corresponds to modern Alsace. This treaty was ambiguous as to whether the city of Bremen was included in the Bishopric of Bremen, which would lead to another war. This treaty confirmed the Duke of Bavaria as an Imperial elector, but restored the electoral rights of the Palatinate. This treaty would be followed a decade later by the Peace of the Pyrenees. The agreements of Munster and Osnabruck jointly made up this treaty, which ended a war involving Wallenstein and Gustavus Adolphus and helped establish the notion of sovereign nation-states. For ten points, name this 1648 agreement that ended the Thirty Years War.

answer: {United States} Navy or {American} Navy

In 1871, this navy seized the Korean island of Ganghwa and occupied it for one month in a failed effort to end the isolationist policies of the Choseon dynasty. The Battle of Cape Gata and the Battle of Cape Palos were two major victories for this navy in the Mediterranean Sea. Later, this navy won the Battle of Cape Esperance in the Pacific Ocean. Today, this navy plans to commission the first of its new Zumwalt-class destroyers in 2015. A ship from this navy was attacked in the Panay incident prior to World War II, while an 1891 international incident was sparked when two sailors from this navy were stabbed in a barroom brawl in Chile. In the early 20th century, this navy demonstrated its power with the global tour of the “Great White Fleet.” For ten points, name this navy whose academy is in Annapolis, Maryland, and which won the Battle of Midway.

answer: {Conversation} in the {Cathedral} ({Spanish}: {Conversacion en} La {Catedral})

In an early scene in this novel, a young journalist goes to the dog pound to retrieve his dog, whom corrupt dogcatchers have stolen. There, he recognizes the man whose job is to club stray dogs to death as his father’s former chauffeur. Later in this novel, the journalist says of his father that he has “no ‘political ideas,’ only ‘political interests,’” while a different senior official, Cayo Bermudez, declares “we’re all with the government out of convenience.” This work addresses the atmosphere of greed and authoritarian repression during the dictatorship of Manuel Odria.  The journalist, Santiago Zavala, opens this book by stepping out of his office for lunch and asking “at what precise moment had Peru fucked itself up?” For ten points, name this novel whose title refers to Zavala’s asking the former chauffeur Ambrosio Pardo to join him for a drink in a bar, a work by Mario Vargas Llosa.

answer: {Three} Dialogues Between {Hylas} and {Philonous}

This work refutes the notion that the facts that an oar appears bent in water and that the moon appears smooth undermine its author’s theory. According to one example used in this work, a cold hand and a warm hand perceive the same water to be both warm and cold. It explains how the author differs from Malebranche and rejects the notion that matter is an occasion, an instrument, or a substratum. Its author had a lot of faith in what is now called the Master Argument, which holds that conceived ideas must be conceived in the mind. This work, which is a reworking of The Principles of Human Knowledge, asserts that only immaterialism is immune to skepticism. For 10 points, the principle “to be is to be perceived” is defended in what set of dialogues by George Berkely?

answer: The {Bridge}

In one section of this work, the title entity is called a “simian Venus” and a “homeless Eve” and “takes night/And lifts her girdles from her, one by one.” That section, “Southern Cross,” is one of “Three Songs” that appear in this work. The speaker observes “the serpent with the eagle in the boughs” in another poem in this work, which contains the phrase “O Appalachian Spring!” That poem, “The Dance,” is part of the second section, “Powhatan’s Daughter.” It contains poems such as “Cutty Sark” and “Cape Hatteras.” The first poem of this cycle addresses a landmark “across the harbor, silver-paced.” For 10 points, name this poetry collection by Hart Crane dedicated to a New York structure.

answer: {Mithras} (accept {Mitra})

This figure is often depicted accompanied by two torch-bearers known as Cautes and Cautopates. One of those attendants is thought to stand behind this figure as he aims his bow at a rock which the other kneels below with cupped hands, a scene known as the “water miracle.” Another common scene features this god, dagger in one hand and torch in the other, wearing only his Phrygian cap, and is known as the “rock birth.” In some cult sites, this figure is depicted dining or shaking hands with Sol, and, like Sol, this figure was often given the epithet invictus. A temple of this figure was known as a spelaeum in Italy and was often built into natural caves alluding to the location of this figure's most famous deed, the taurocthony. For 10 points, name this bull-slaying Roman god, derived from an Iranian deity, whose cult was popular among soldiers in the 1st through 4th centuries AD.

answer: {Lagrangian} [do not accept “{Euler}-{Lagrange}” or “{Lagrange equation}”]

The spatial integral of this function’s density, which is usually used when describing fields, gives the standard form of this function. The contribution of a single history of a path integral is exponentially proportional to the time integral of this function. Most of those histories cancel out, and classically, a system is described only by the time integral of this function that is stationary compared to nearby paths, as stated by Hamilton’s principle. That time integral is the action of a system. Solving for a stationary action gives a pair of differential equations named for Euler and the man who names this function, and the Legendre transform of this function is one that serves a similar role, the Hamiltonian. For 10 points, name this function, usually expressed in classical mechanics as the difference of the kinetic and potential energy.

answer: Versions of the {Sacrifice} of {Isaac}

One version by Cigoli was done for the Pitti Palace and sees an animal peeking out in the lower right corner.  One version by Tiepolo has the same animal chewing on weeds far below a descending figure who is completely separated from the others by a bursting ray of light from the heavens.  Rembrandt painted one with a particularly dark canvas: in the bottom, the title youth lies atop blue cloth, head forced back. Versions of this work as a bronze relief tested candidates for a major Florentine commission, the Baptistery doors. Two versions by Caravaggio exist: in the Princeton version, the angel’s hand rests atop the ram’s head, but in the Uffizi version, the angel’s hand is in its usual position, directly grabbing the wrist of the man engaged in the title action, so preventing him from slitting the youth's throat.  For 10 points, those are all depictions of this biblical event, God’s test of Abraham.

answer: {Peptidoglycan}

This is the only known biological molecule that contains D-amino acids. Some organisms use the O-acetyltransferase OatA[read: “oat-A”]  to modify this molecule, making it resistant to hydrolysis. Other organisms have PGRP proteins that recognize this molecule and upregulate an immune response. The monomer of this molecule consists of two joined sugars, NAG and NAM. Chains of these monomers are cross-linked by transpeptidase to form a three dimentional structure, a reaction that is inhibited by beta lactams such as penicillin. This molecule functions to protect the cell from osmotic lysis, which can occur when this molecule is hydrolyzed by lysosime. For 10 points, name this molecule that, along with teichoic and teichuronic acids, makes up the bacterial cell wall.

answer: {Lyndon Larouche}, {Jr.}

In January, this man delivered his own State of the Union in which he claimed the British were controlling world finance through the Inter-Alpha Group. This man considers himself a “New Federalist” and supports a modern “American System” where space will play a large role. Kenneth Kronberg's death has been linked to this man after one of his “morning briefings” suggested baby boomers like Kronberg commit suicide, and other allegations of wrongdoing against this man include accusations his National Caucus of Labor Committees was fascist. Imprisonment for mail fraud and conspiracy did not stop the presidential aspirations, of, for 10 points, which man Homer Simpson was horrified to learn “was right!” about “aliens, bioduplication, [and] nude conspiracies,” a perennial Presidential candidate and opponent of irrational numbers.

answer: {Cantor} set or {Cantor} space or {Cantor} dust

This space is the universal compact metric space in the sense that there is a continuous surjection from it to any other non-empty compact metric space. A "wild" example of this space which is embedded in R^3 [read “R three”] with its complement not simply connected is Antoine's necklace. Though it has measure zero, analogues with positive measure that are still nowhere dense can be constructed as so-called "fat" examples. The Devil's staircase function has derivative zero on the complement of this set but is not constant. By the Moore-Kline theorem every non-empty, compact, perfect, and totally disconnected metric space is homeomorphic to it. A multi-dimensional version is called this type of dust. For 10 points, name this set, constructed by starting with the unit interval and then successively removing the middle-thirds of all intervals in sight.

answer: A {Hazard} of {New Fortunes}

One character in this novel proposes to Alma Leighton but is rejected because Leighton prefers to pursue an art career. A woman involved with charity work, Margaret Vance, is the object of affection of both Angus Beaton and a magazine publisher, who is killed after being convinced to calm a riot. Another character in this novel makes an impression at the dinner table because he had lost a hand in battle. That character, Berthold Lindau, is beaten by a policeman during a streetcar strike that turns violent, and it is in shielding Lindau that the publisher Conrad Dryfoos is killed. The protagonist and Dryfoos begin a literary magazine entitled Every Other Week in, for 10 points, what Basil March-narrated novel about social conflict by William Dean Howells?
