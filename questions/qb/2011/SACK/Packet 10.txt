answer: St. {Matthew Passion} or {Matthaus}-{Passion}

Some of the sections of this piece recycle motifs from its composer’s cantata “Lament, O Children.”  The ninth scene in this work describes the preparation of the Paschal Lamb, which echoes a motif that is absent from the text on which this work is based. This work’s innovation in its genre was to intersperse arias for one or more texts in a contemporary voice among this work’s fifteen chorales, which are by contrast drawn from a certain Biblical source. This work’s double chorus was conceived for the first venue where it was performed, St. Thomas’ Church in Leipzig on Good Friday, 1727. An influential 1829 performance, which resurrected this work’s composer, was conducted by Felix Mendelssohn. For ten points, name this oratorio, with libretto by Christian Friedrich Henrici and music by J.S. Bach, drawn from the 26th and 27th chapters of one of the Gospels.

answer: {Sartor Resartus}

Lore Metzger wrote about this work’s borrowed elements from Goethe’s Faust, and Alcott states that Jo had never read this work before her meeting with Mr. Dashwood in Little Women. One chapter in this work talks about a semiotics of spirit and is entitled “Circumspective.” Another chapter contrasts the potato-eating poor with those who read primarily popular novels. It contains chapters entitled “The Everlasting No” and “The Everlasting Yea,” and the main character realizes the futility of affection after he is seduced by Blumine. The protagonist’s work is a response to a statement of Jonathan Swift comparing man to a “Micro-Coat.” The main character of this work is a German philosopher writing his tome “Clothes: Their Origin and Influence.” For 10 points, name this novel about the ideas of Diogenes Teufelsdrockh by Thomas Carlyle.

answer: {Great Rift} Valley (prompt on “{rift valley}”)

Lakes found in this geographic feature tend to be of two very different types: either mineral and located below sea level, or very deep and biologically diverse, forming the heads of river systems like the Ruhuhu. The Beqaa Valley is one part of this geographical feature, whose generally violent history is explained by its fertility, most recently following the 2007 Kenyan Presidential election. South of the Beqaa, it is known as the Hula Valley between Lake Tiberias and the Golan Heights. Both valleys are part of the Dead Sea Transform, which also includes the Gulf of Aqaba and meets the Red Sea Transform south of  the Sinai Peninsula. The Olduvai Gorge is in the Eastern branch of this feature; the Western branch includes Lakes Kivu and Tanganyika. For ten points, what is this geographical feature marking the boundary of the Arabian and African plates?

answer: {Louis Napoleon} Bonaparte or {Napoleon III}

While in prison, this man wrote an economic manifesto titled “The Extinction of Pauperism.” Later, this man appointed as Education Minister the Count of Falloux, who passed two namesake laws promoting Catholic schools. This man’s cabinet also included the Count of Persigny, who was Interior Minister, and the Polish-born Count Walewski, who was Foreign Minister. This leader caused an international incident when he ordered the warship Charlemagne into the Black Sea, part of a dispute over who would be the protector of Maronite Christians. This man signed a secret treaty at Plombiers in which he agreed to intervene in Italy. This man’s capital city was redesigned by Baron Haussman, and this ruler was forced to abdicate after the Battle of Sedan, leading to the Third Republic. For ten points, name this man who ruled France during the Second Empire.

answer: {Vietnam Veterans Memorial}

There are two half-sized replicas of this work currently traveling; one first went on display in 1984 in Tyler, Texas, and the other debuted in 1996.  Those are the “moving” one and the one “that heals”, respectively.  One sculptural addition to the main part of this was so offensive to the architect of the main element that the architect refused to attend its dedication.  That Frederick Hart sculpture is of three men who are Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic.  Another addition featured Hope, Faith, and Charity, three nurses tending to a wounded soldier.  The main part of this work is an organic design of two gabbro walls sunk into the earth that tapered down at the ends.  With over 58,000 names engraved in its walls, for 10 points, identify this work that was designed by then-Yale undergraduate Maya Lin.

answer: {Pali Canon} or {Tripitaka}

A section of this work recounting eighty inspired utterances includes the Blind From Birth chapter, in which one figure tells the story of blind men describing different parts of an elephant. That chapter is part of the Udana. A later portion of this work is named for its pairs of questions and is called the Yamaka, while a larger section is itself divided into five pieces known as “collections,” the first of which is the Digha Nikaya. Its Parivara section provides analysis on rules presented in its Suttavibhanga section which includes much of the Pattimokkha, a list of rules for monks and nuns. Those sections are part of its Vinaya part, which, along with the Sutta and Abhidhamma, is one of its sections known as the “three baskets.” For 10 points, name this text of Therevada Buddhism whose more common name refers to the extinct Indo-Aryan language in which it was written.

answer: {Byzantine} Empire or {Eastern Roman} Empire

One revolt in this empire was sparked by the assassination of the mercenary Roger de Flor, which caused his mostly Catalonian soldiers to mutiny and raid this empire’s outer cities. Loukas Notaras was an important minister during the late history of this empire. This empire is believed to have organized an event that resulted in the Peace of Caltabellotta. That event was a rebellion in which French soldiers were killed following evening prayers, which resulted in the House of Anjou losing control of Sicily. The Sicilian Vespers was part of the foreign policy of this empire’s Michael VIII, who was from the House of Palaeologus. For ten points, name this empire with capital Constantinople.

answer: {fields}

According to Wedderburn's little theorem, every finite domain is a finite one of these and therefore has prime power order. An extension is said to be “Galois” if the one of these fixed by the automorphism group of the extension is the base one of these. Given a polynomial, “splitting” ones of these are defined to be extensions for which the polynomial can be completely factored into linear factors. The quotient of a ring with one of its maximal ideals is one of these entities. These entities have no nontrivial ideals, and the only finite ones are of order p to the k, where p is prime. Given an integral domain, it is always possible to form one of these from its fractions. For 10 points, name this algebraic structure which has two binary operations and inverses for both, examples of which include the complex numbers, the real numbers, and the rational numbers.

answer: {Bile}

Sequesterants of this substance, including drugs like Questran, cause this substance to be excreted instead of reabsorbed, causing the body to synthesize more of this substance and therefore consume more of its precursor. One component of this substance is cholic acid, which can conjugate with taurine to form taurocholic acid, a substance used by the body to emulsify fats. Chyme induces the duodenum to produce cholecystokinin, which in turn stimulates the release of this substance. Bilirubin is excreted as part of this substance gives this substance its characteristic bright greenish-yellow color. For 10 points, its namesake salts are one component of this substance that is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder.

answer: {Satsuma} Rebellion

A man named Nakahara was sent to determine if this event was going to occur, only to be captured and tortured by the leaders of this event. This event began with an attack on a weapons stockpile at Somuta, and much like the earlier Shimpuren Movement, this event targeted Kumamoto Castle. Many leaders of this movement were on the losing side of the Seikanron Debate, in which they had unsuccessfully advocated a war, and thereafter they had resigned and returned to their home prefecture. This event ended with the Battle of Shiroyama and was led by Saigo Takamori, whose followers famously charged machine guns with swords. For ten points, name this rebellion of samurai against the Meiji restoration.

answer: {Cimabue} (accept {Cenni Di Pepolo})

Vasari claimed that this artist neglected his classical studies in favor of watching the Gondi Chapel being frescoed. Dante compared Oderisi Da Grubbio to this artist who once “held the field.” One work by this artist shows two crowds of people flanking a crucifix; that work is now almost entirely blackened. This artist painted another crucifixion with small icons for the Basilica of Santa Croce; that work was badly damaged in the 1966 Arno flood. This artist painted a seated Madonna and Child flanked by four angels on each side, the Santa Trinita Madonna, technically surpassed by the Ognissanti Madonna, with which it now shares a room in the Uffizi. The comparison dramatizes Vasari’s observation that this artist was “overshadowed by a greater light,” namely, his most famous student. For ten points, name this artist who is thought to have taught Giotto.

answer: {shielding} (accept {effective nuclear charge} before (*))

Ronald Rich explained a complication with this phenomenon that occurs in copper and chromium, among other transition metals.  The namesake constant of this effect can be determined by using a set of rules based on the variational method of Zener, and were improved using the wavefunctions of helium to krypton by Clement and Raimondi.  The usual way of finding the constant for this effect, assuming no radial nodes,predicts whether this phenomenon is 35, 85, or 100 percent effective, and is known as Slater’s rules; that namesake constant is used to calculate (*) effective nuclear charge. This effect explains why the 4-S orbital fills before the 3-D orbital. For ten points, identify this phenomenon, in which the attraction between the nucleus and distant electrons is decreased because inner electrons block those further out.

answer: {Dean Acheson}

A speech by this man before the National Press Club declared a “defensive perimeter” running from the Aleutians through Japan to the Philippines, which Stalin and his puppet Kim Il Sung decided to test since it left Korea on the other side. A White Paper overseen by this man defended his predecessor’s policy of refusing armed intervention in the Chinese civil war, arguing that it would have been fruitless to defend the regime of Chiang Kai-Shek. He was an early supporter of dismissing Douglas MacArthur from command of UN forces in Korea. Those stances earned him the ire of the red-baiting faction in the US Senate, and Joseph McCarthy waved around a list of 205 people under his authority, alleged “card-carrying members of the Communist Party.” For ten points, name this architect of the North Atlantic Treaty and of containment, Secretary of State during Truman’s second term..

answer: The {Battle} of the {Books} [accept “A {Full} and {True Account} of the {Battle Fought} Last {Friday} Between the {Ancient} and {Modern Books} in {St. James’s Library}”]

In this story, an argument between a bee and a spider is an allegory for the main dispute, of which Pallas is the patron goddess of one side and Momus of the other. When his side’s prospects look bleak, Momus goes to Nova Zembla to gain the support of the daughter of Ignorance and Pride, Criticism, who takes the form of Bentley to encourage Wotton in a mock epic scene. Other mock epic elements in this work include an episode in which Bentley and Wotton try to spy on the enemy and kill William Temple, which is unsuccessful. The origin of the dispute comes from a larger war between two parties on two peaks of Parnassus, as one insists the other shorten its summit, which is based on the real dispute between Temple and Wotton over the question of the superiority of the Ancients to the Moderns. Published as an introduction to The Tale of a Tub, for 10 points, name this satire by Jonathan Swift.

answer: ribozymes

The “gene shears” technology is a synthetic one of these molecules that is being developed for the treatment of viruses. One of these molecules regulates cellular production of glucosamine-6-phosphate. Hepatitis D relies on one of these molecules for its replication and viability, and another is used by plant viruses to process the products of rolling circle replication. The latter is a hairpin one of these molecules, a form which, like the hammerhead variety of these, does not require a metal ion to be catalytically active. These molecules are able to catalyze aminotransferase activity, but they are most notable for their ability to cleave themselves and are thought to be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome. For 10 points, give this name for RNA molecules that are able to catalyze chemical reactions.

answer: Marcus Porcius {Cato} (“the Elder” or “the {Younger}”)

According to Livy, one man of this name gave a speech against the repeal of a law forbidding female extravagance, the Oppian Law, while consul alongside Lucius Valerius Flaccus. The next year he campaigned in the lower Ebro Valley after having been appointed governor of Nearer Spain. That man also compared usury to murder, and defended farming as the most noble profession in the oldest surviving work of Latin prose, De Agri Cultura. Plutarch pairs another man of this name with Phocion “the Good,” and describes his immunity to bribery and his noble suicide which occurred at Utica, after he and the remaining Optimates had been defeated by Caesar. For 10 points, give this name shared by two Roman statesmen, the Elder of whom is known as the Censor and was famous for concluding all of his speeches with the remark “Carthago delenda est.”
