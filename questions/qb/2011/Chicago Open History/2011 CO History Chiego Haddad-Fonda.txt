answer: Srivijaya

Muaro Jambi was one of this empire’s major centers, and Yavadvipa may have been an early name for this empire used in some chronicles. A king of this empire named Sanfotsi sent tribute to China, while four stone inscriptions including ones at Kedukan Buki and Talang Tuwo from the 7th century describe raids against a nearby island. This empire was eventually succeeded by the Majapahits. One of its emperors, Indravarman, sent embassies to the Umayyads to learn Islam, but later attacks by the Chola weakened its ports and siltation of the Muri River cut off easy access to its capital, Palembang. Parts of Borneo and Malaysia were included in, for 10 points, what empire that ruled from the 7th through 13th centuries from its base in Sumatra?

answer: {Daniel O’Connell} (or {Dónal} Ó {Conaill})

At a lecture in 1845, this man called Frederick Douglass the black version of himself. After a speech in which he called the government of a particular city “a beggarly corporation,” this man killed John D’Esterre in a duel. Among this man’s political projects were the signing of the Lichfield House Compact to form an unlikely political alliance and the organization of “monster meetings” such as the one at Tara on behalf of the Repeal Association. George IV had to be convinced by Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington to change a particular law after this man could not swear the Oath of Supremacy necessary to take up his seat representing County Clare on account of the fact that he was not a Protestant. For 10 points, name this man who secured the right for Catholics to join the British Parliament and thus became known in Ireland as “the Emancipator.”

answer: {friendly fire} (accept obvious equivalents {such} as “{soldiers} of the {same side shooting} at {each} other”)

The HMS Cardiff committed this action during the Falklands War in the Gazelle Incident, and an IFF malfunction led to one of these occurring during Operation Provide Comfort in Northern Iraq. General Adam Stephen’s brigade engaged in this action this during the Battle of Germantown during the Revolutionary War, and this action took place near Irwinsville, Georgia, during the capture of Jefferson Davis. American relations with Canada were strained after this action in the Tarnak Farms Incident, and a star was mistaken for a sun during one of these incidents during the Battle of Barnet. In a possibly apocryphal 1788 incident, fears of Turkish cavalry led to the Battle of Karansebes when parts of the Austrian army engaged in this action. For 10 points, identify this type of military event that killed Pat Tillman in Afghanistan and Stonewall Jackson at the Battle of Chancellorsville.

answer: {Abu Abdallah} Muhammad ibn {Battuta}

When this man helped the pregnant Bayalan, the daughter of Andronikos III Paleologos, reach Constantinople, he was horrified to see her start drinking and eating pork as soon as she crossed back into Christian territory. Omar I forced this man, who borrowed liberally from Muhammad al-Abdari and was assisted by Muhammad ibn Juzayy, to be the chief Maliki jurist of the Maldives, but he was hated there for being too strict. His patron for many years was Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultan of Delhi, who eventually sent him to Quanzhou and Hangzhou. In addition to China, he also made it to Southeast Asia and Mali after leaving Tangier to go on the first of three hajjes. For 10 points, name this Moroccan traveler who wandered 75,000 miles in the fourteenth century.

answer: {International Military Tribunal} for the Far {East} (or {IMTFE} or {Tokyo Trials} or {Tokyo} War {Crimes Tribunal}; prompt on {something} like “{Japanese war crimes trials}”)

Henry R. Sackett tried to get this body to turn on a man who, according to Herbert Bix, was protected by the witness tampering of Bonner Fellers; that failure led to critiques by several of the men who oversaw this entity, including Henri Bernard and William Webb. Radhabinod Pal dissented from this body because it had not addressed the issue of colonialism, but a more objectionable component may have been the deal struck with members of Unit 731, who had to come clean about such practices as operations performed without anesthetic while under the command of Shiro Ishii. Among those who were tried and convicted was the leader of the Kwantung Army. Seishiro Itagaki and Hideki Tojo were hanged because of it, but it notably did not target the Emperor, Hirohito. For 10 points, name this Far Eastern equivalent of Nuremburg that doled out justice in the wake of World War II in the capital of Japan.

answer: {governor} of {Georgia}

Rufus Bullock was secretly forced to resign this position in 1871. This position was formerly elected via the county unit system, which gave rural counties disproportionate voting power. Another holder of this position lost the state university’s accreditation after firing three members of the state board of regents over suspected integrationist sympathies during the Cocking Affair. After that man, Eugene Talmadge, died in 1946, three men claimed this position, with Elis Arnal setting up an “in-exile” office and Herman Talmadge literally locking Melvin Thompson out of this office. Two holders of this position were named Joe Brown, the elder of which was a prominent critic of Jefferson Davis during the Civil War. Another occupant of this position operated the Pickrick Cafeteria and wielded an axe-handle. For 10 points, identify this position currently held by Nathan Deal and previously held by Lester Maddox.

answer: {Brittany} (or {Bretagne} )

One revolt in this region, which was sparked in 1675 by the rumor that a salt tax was going to be imposed, was the Revolt of the Bonnets Rouges. In 1464, in more peaceful times, a priest from this region named Jehan Langadeuc wrote the Catholicon, the world’s first trilingual dictionary. The last independent duke of this region, Francis II, lost the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier during the so-called “Mad War” and had to sign the Treaty of Verger. The 1364 Battle of Auray allowed John de Montfort to seize control of this region at the end of its War of Succession. A group of deputies to the Estates General from this region founded the club that became the Jacobin Club, but the most famous event in this region may have been Henry IV’s decision to tolerate Huguenots in an edict signed in its historical capital, Nantes. Rennes and Brest are also located in, for 10 points, what region west of Normandy that is considered one of six Celtic nations?

Arthur Hoffman was forced to resign from this country’s government after Robert Grimm claimed he was acting on this country’s authority. This country brokered an agreement concerning where artillery fire could be aimed around the Stelvino Pass. The deliverer of the Rütlirapport speech, Henry Guisan designed its fortification systems, including the Fortress Saint-Maurice and an initial line along its northern border. One plan for invading this country was named Operation Tannenbaum, and this country was accused of aiding Germany by continuing to trade jewel sights and gold during World War II.

Jim Traficant was the last person to vote for a member of another party for this office. This position was stripped of much of its power after Democrats and rogue Republicans team up during the 1910 “Cannon Revolt,” which eliminated its dual role as chairman of the rules committee, while one of the holders of this position held after-hours “Board of Education” meetings. This office, which was first held by Frederick Muhlenberg, was later held by a man from Massachusetts who claimed that “all politics is local.” Sam Rayburn, Tip O’Neill, and James Blaine all held, for 10 points, which position whose current orange inhabitant is John Boehner?

answer: al-Sadr  

One man with this surname wrote Wilayat al-umma and may have been killed when a nail was driven into his skull before he was set on fire. Another man with this surname founded the Movement of the Disinherited and railed against Maronite dominance before Muammar al-Gaddafi allegedly caused his disappearance. A cousin of that founder of the Amal movement defied Saddam Hussein and was murdered in Najaf. This surname graces a suburb of Baghdad where poor followers of Iraq’s majority faith are particularly inclined to join the Mahdi Army, which is led by the most famous holder of this surname. For 10 points, give this surname shared by Lebanese and Iraqi Shi’ite leaders Musa, Muhammad Sadiq, and Muqtada.

A precursor to this insurgency called the Omakaitse were eventually disarmed. The istrebiteli program of arming villagers tried unsuccessfully to combat these insurgents. Members of this insurgency often engaged in train robberies to steal funds and failed in an attempt to assassinate Villis Lacis. Operation Priboi was an attempt to depopulate regions where these insurgents were located, and a group of former politicians, the VLK, was a major political force during this insurgency. One member of this insurgency, Juozas Lukša, attempted to enlist Western support for its efforts, but he was killed after being trained by the CIA. The Iron Wolf group was one of the last organized groups in this insurgency, and members of this group were influential in disrupting balloting during Communist-controlled elections. Holdouts from this insurgency continued to be found in the late 1960s and 1970s. For 10 points, identify these insurgents who resisted both Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany in the Baltic States.

answer: {Tibet} (or {Xizang})

One war that ended in defeat for this region was sparked by a dispute involving the chieftain of Beri and the inhabitants of Nyarong. Another controversy in this region occurred when its leader denied authorizing Agvan Dorzhiev to sign a secret treaty on its behalf in Urga. This region’s future was settled by a Seventeen Point Plan agreed to by representatives of a man who had been tutored by Heinrich Harrer. After fighting in Kham and Amdo in 1959 got out of control and guns were placed within range of Norbulinka, the one-time ruler of this region was forced to flee; thereafter, that man ran a government-in-exile from Dharamsala.

answer: {York} (accept {Eboracum} before it is mentioned or {Jorvik} before “{Clifford’s Tower}”)

An archbishop of this city who was expelled for collaborating with invaders was named Wulfhere. In 1190, many Jews committed suicide inside this city’s Clifford’s Tower when surrounded by an angry mob. Septimius Severus became ill during a campaign and lived the last years of his life in this city when it was known as Eboracum. Because Constantinius Chlorus died while campaigning here, Constantine the Great was first declared emperor in this city. One duke of this city was routed at the Battle of Ludford Bridge. That man’s son, a member of the house named for this city, was victorious in the Battle of Barnet, in which he defeated Richard Neville, and in the Battles of Towton and Tewkesbury; that man’s brother, however, was eventually defeated in the 1485 Battle of Bosworth Field.

Theodore Roosevelt accompanied noted wolf-wrestler John Abernath on a wolf hunting expedition in the Big Pasture region of this state in 1905. This state was the site of a multiracial socialism-inspired uprising during World War I that opposed conscription called the Green Corn Rebellion. This state was also the site of an event that began with Dick Rowland fleeing from an elevator that later involved incendiary bombs dropped from airplanes and the destruction of the Greenwood District in the largest city in this state. Representatives of this state drafted a constitution and tried to get admitted to the Union in 1905 as the State of Sequoyah, and this state’s economy boomed in the 1920s because of the discovery of oil near Glenpool.

answer: {nuclear} program of the {Republic} of {South Africa} (prompt {generously})

In 1997, Aziz Pahad confirmed in an interview with Haaretz, then subsequently retracted, that this program had been responsible for a famous “double flash.” Dieter Gerhardt, a Soviet spy, also claimed upon his release from prison that this project launched something codenamed Operation Phoenix to cause the Vela Incident. Shimon Peres argued that documents released in 2010 by the Guardian claiming to prove Israeli support for this program were selected unfairly. This project first came to fruition in 1977 at the Vastrap Range using material developed in the research center of Pelindaba, and De Villiers Graaff claims to have shut it down immediately after he learned of it. Although it prevented the governments of B.J. Vorster and P.W. Botha from signing onto a 1968 treaty also boycotted by India, Israel, and Pakistan, its existence was not admitted until the presidency of F.W. de Klerk. For 10 points, name this program that never produced anything actually used to fight communism in Angola.
