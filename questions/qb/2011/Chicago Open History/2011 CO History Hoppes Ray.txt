answer: {Ecclesiastical History} of the {English People} (or {History} of the {English Church} and {People} or {Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum})

At one point in this work, a man was burned on his shoulder and jaw when he saw a vision of the fourfold fires of Falsehood, Covetousness, Discord, and Cruelty. That man, Fursey, was the follower of a king who was dragged out of a monastery by his own subjects and forced to go into battle against King Penda armed only with a stick. In one episode from this work, a priest called Coifi uses a spear and stallion to deface a pagan temple after a royal councillor compares the life of man to the flight of a sparrow through a banqueting-hall during a winter storm. The activities of Mellitus, Paulinus, and Aidan are described in this work that uses Edwin as an example of a good king, or bretwalda, of an island that its author claims is inhabited by those of five languages and four nations, including the Picts, the Irish, and the British. For 10 points, the conversion of Anglo-Saxon England is the subject matter of what best-known work by the Venerable Bede?

answer: Battle of {South Mountain}

This was the first battle fought by the 17th Michigan regiment, which led a charge near the Wise cabin that surrounded and captured more than two hundred men from Thomas Drayton’s Georgia and South Carolina brigade. One general killed during this battle was Samuel Garland, whose North Carolina troops began it with a struggle against the attacking Union Kanawha Division. Another casualty was a man shot during a skirmish between the 51st Pennsylvania and Hood’s Division; that man was Jesse Reno, the commander of the Ninth Corps under Ambrose Burnside. John Gibbon’s Wisconsin and Indiana troops received the nickname the “Iron Brigade” for their actions late in this battle, when they drove D.H. Hill’s Confederates away from Turner’s Gap along the National Road. For 10 points, name this battle fought for control of a ridgeline in western Maryland three days before the Battle of Antietam.

answer: Tuscarora

John Lawson, who wrote that these people profited greatly from trading rum to the Siouan people of the interior, was captured and killed on the orders of their leader, King Hancock. Another of their leaders was Tom Blunt, who advised Hancock to spare Lawson’s colleague Christian von Graffenreid, the co-founder of a settlement by Swiss Protestants on their territory. They threatened to take sides in the struggle between Thomas Cary and Governor Hyde, and ultimately formed alliances with the Nynee and Bear River peoples to prosecute an unsuccessful 1711 to 1713 war against North Carolina. That namesake war ended with their travel to the north and settlement in the Susquehanna Valley and the Oneida country. For 10 points, what southern group of Native Americans thus became the sixth and final tribe to join the league of the Iroquois?

answer: {Worms} (accept {Burchard} of {Worms}, {Concordat} of {Worms}, or {Diet} of {Worms})

One resident of this city condemned wayward wives for making their husbands impotent by baking bread from wheat and honey smeared on the wives’ naked bodies; that passage is contained in the Corrector sive Medicus, the 19th volume in a collection of 20 books on church government written by Burchard, an 11th century bishop of this city. An agreement reached in this city provided for the reception of the regalia “through the sceptre”; that agreement reached between Callixtus II and emperor Henry V was the 1122 concordat of this city that brought a halt to the investiture controversy. In the Nibelungenlied, this city is the location of the Burgundian court. Along with Speyer and Mainz, it is home one of the three imperial cathedrals of the Rhineland. In a later meeting at this city, Johann Eck, assistant to the Archbishop of Trier, asked a question which drew the response “my conscience is captive to the word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything.” For 10 points, what German city was visited by Charles V and Martin Luther during a 1521 Diet?

answer: Grand Duchy of {Tuscany}

This polity was granted to the son of the Duke of Parma under the Treaty of Aranjuez, and although it was thereby promoted to a kingdom, it was soon granted to Elisa Bonaparte, Napoleon’s oldest sister. In order to escape conscription during the Seven Years’ War, residents of this polity fled to the Papal States. The flagship of this polity’s navy was intended to pick up a cargo of spices that could not be delivered to Antwerp; instead the galleon San Francesco was seized by the Marquis of Santa Cruz and sent to the Azores before it joined the Spanish Armada. Francis Stephen of Lorraine, the husband of Maria Theresa, became the ruler of this polity after the last ruler of its original dynasty, Gian Gastone, died without heir in 1737. For 10 points, the Medici family had ruled what Italian grand duchy on the banks of the River Arno?

answer: {Amazon} River

Roger North led an Irish expedition to settle in the valley of this river, which ended in anarchy when Bernard O’Brien learned the language of its inhabitants, traveled up it to visit a queen called the “Great Lady” and organized local bowmen to fight against the Dutch and the Franciscans. Native ecology in the region around this river was described in a book by Betty Meggers, who called it “a counterfeit paradise.” More recent interpretations by Anna Roosevelt have stressed the long-term accomplishments of manioc-based civilizations like those that created the pottery of Marajo island at its mouth. An opera house named the Teatro [of this river] was built during its rubber boom in Manaus, a city at the confluence of the Rio Negro and this river. For 10 points, conquistador Francisco de Orellana voyaged down what river that he named after the warrior women of Greek myth?

answer: {Navarre} or {Navarra} (accept {Pamplona} before mentioned; accept {Nafarroako} from {ETA homeboy})

Edward the Black Prince arranged the Treaty of Mantes after a ruler of this state murdered Charles de la Cerda, enraging John the Good before going on to engage in no end of asshattery during the Hundred Years War. It devolved into civil war under John the Faithless, while another of its rulers often allied with Berengar the Hunchback and built it into a dominant power after succeeding a father nicknamed “the Trembler;” the power struggle of the sons of that man, called “the Great,” saw this state lose at the Battle of Atapuerca under a ruler from Najera. The second rise of this homeland of Charles the Bad occurred under “The Restorer” after Alfonso the Battler tried to re-gift it to Templars; that man, Garcia, mortgaged his daughter Berengaria to Richard the Lionhearted and built up a renowned scholastic court, earning him the epithet “the Wise.” It was ruled by a number of Sanchos, including “the Fat,” who fought at Las Navas de Tolosa along with Alfonso VIII of Castile and Pedro II of Aragon. For 10 points, identify this kingdom in the Pyrenees once known as Pamplona, whose ruler Henry III went on to become Henry IV of France.

answer: John {Keegan}

This man’s most recent work submits that a “go and see” approach won out because the titular conflict was governed by geography above all else. Another of this man’s works describes repetitive stress deformities seen in the shoulders of exhumed bodies to dispute the narrative that such men could have possibly achieved the necessary accuracy and rate of fire. That work further claims that plate armor had no particular vulnerability to “special arrows;” rather, heavy cavalry was vulnerable to palings and sinking into the mud at Agincourt, which this man analyzes along with Waterloo and the Somme in The Face of Battle. The 101st combat drop and Rod Keller’s landing on Juno Beach are among the titular narratives of this man’s Six Armies in Normandy, while he controversially decried the undervaluation of psychology in Clausewitzian theory in his major work of historiography. For 10 points, identify this British military historian who wrote The Second World War and A History of Warfare.

answer: Elijah {Lovejoy}

This man denounced Judge Luke Lawless as “a foreigner and a papist” because the judge was Irish-born; the Catholic newspaper Shepherd of the Valley responded by calling this man a “forger and slanderer.” He responded to the lynching of riverboatman Francis McIntosh by writing that “we must stand by the Constitution or laws, or all is gone.” Royal Weller and this man helped push a ladder away from the wall of William Gilman’s warehouse, but both were shot in the process, allowing the attackers to seize and destroy the fourth of this man’s printing presses, which had been donated by the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society. For 10 points, name this editor of the Alton Observer, an abolitionist murdered by a pro-slavery mob in Illinois in 1837.

answer: {What} Is to Be {Done? Burning Questions} of {our Movement}

This document’s first section features two extended footnotes, respectively alluding to Possibilist-Guesdist conflict and discussing Rabocheye Dyelo, that the author specified be moved to the body of the text. This work begins by noting that “freedom of criticism” is presently “the most fashionable slogan,” and muses on those who were offended by the article “Where to Begin.” The author divides his country’s history into three ages, the second of which lasts just four years and the third of which must be ended to answer this work’s central premise. This work emphasizes the importance of expanding beyond the sphere of the proletariat, and was heavily inspired by a work that touts Vera Pavlova and Rakhmetov as the saviors of the new age, a novel with the same title penned by Nikolai Chernyshevsky. Advocating a “vanguard” of the revolution, for 10 points, identify this pivotal 1902 pamphlet written by Vladimir Lenin.

answer: Franklin Delano {Roosevelt’s} First {Inaugural} (prompt on partial answer; accept clear knowledge equivalents; accept “{Roosevelt’s 1933} Inauguration {Speech} before mentioned)

The opening line of this speech was modified literally minutes before it was given, with the speaker excising a line about “candor and decision.” It identified the speaker as the “present instrument” of a mandate for “direct, vigorous action” and invoked biblical imagery when describing “no plague of locusts” and the “money changers... in the temple.” Shortly before its delivery, those present with comedic fervor at the site of a top hat bobbing through the crowd. Opening by declaring “a day of national consecration,” it repeatedly paired the words “respect” and “neighbor,” foreshadowing the Montevideo Conference nine months later. A barricaded, wooden apparatus was constructed on the East steps of the capital for this speech, which cited efforts to “convert retreat into advance” while decrying a force as “nameless, unreasoning, unjustified.” It was quickly followed by the suspension of the gold standard and Emergency Banking Act. Famously declaring “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” this was, for 10 points, what speech delivered before a pouty Herbert Hoover on March 4, 1933 by the future architect of the New Deal?

answer: {Sabra} and {Shatila} Massacre

The probable lead perpetrator of this action had earned the nickname “Chef Edward” during similar forays a decade earlier, and went on to become a local warlord based in Zahle. One participant in this event defended his actions as a merely formally complying with UNSCR 520 during a $50 million libel suit against Time stemming from this event, which was preceded by a bomb detonation that killed Bachir Gemayel, enraging the Kataeb Party. Elie Hobeika’s forces were able to carry on slaughtering people through the night thanks to flares fired from a third party, which led the Kahan Commission to declare the sitting Defense Minister “personally responsible.” Hundreds of armed Phalangists were driven to the site of this event by the IDF, which had just invaded West Beirut. For 10 points, identify this 1982 massacre in which Ariel Sharon ushered pissed off, armed Lebanese Maronite into the two namesake Palestinian refugee camps and was then totally astonished when they slaughtered thousands of residents.

answer: {Narmer Palette} (accept {Great Hierakonopolis Palette} before mentioned; do not accept “the {Menes Palette},” which is not a {thing})

The top of this object features the catfish and chisel figures, which read in a phonetic sequence. Three bull figures, references to the goddess Bat, surround a central image of two serpopards with their necks intertwined on one portion of this object; on the reverse side, a man kneels while the namesake figure wields a mace. The goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet are suggested by the Deshret and Hedjet – the Red and White crowns – notably depicted in this piece atop the head of its namesake. This object’s main companion piece may feature a predecessor of the Nine Bows insignia, and depicts a marriage ceremony with Neithhotep. That macehead was found along with this piece at Hierakonopolis’s Main Deposit, which also contained a macehead depicting the Scorpion King. Considered a symbol of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, this was, for 10 points, what slab that depicts the namesake pharaoh of early Egypt, a unifier known to the Greeks as Menes?
