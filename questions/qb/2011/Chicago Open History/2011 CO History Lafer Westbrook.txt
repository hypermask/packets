answer: {Sherman} Silver {Purchase} Act

The passage of this act in the Senate ensured the failure of Thomas Brackett Reed's Federal Elections Bill that called for enforcement of the 15th amendment in the South.

Democrats who supported the repeal of this act formed a presidential ticket of Simon Bolivar Buckner and John Palmer that received 1% of the vote. Passed in the same legislative package as the McKinley Tariff, the depletion of gold reserves caused by this act led to a bailout of the government by JP Morgan and the repeal of this law by Grover Cleveland. For 10 points, name this 1890 act that called for 4.5 million additional ounces of silver per month beyond the amount demanded by the Bland-Allison Act.
