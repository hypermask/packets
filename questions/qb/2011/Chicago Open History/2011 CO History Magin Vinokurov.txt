answer: Treaty (or Peace) of {Cambrai}

As a consequence of this treaty, one signatory was allowed to ransom his sons rather than be forced to give up Burgundy in exchange for them. The war which preceded the signing of this treaty degenerated into a stalemate when the Genoese fleet defected from one side to the other, and as a consequence of this treaty one signatory received the lands of Charles de Bourbon and William of Orange. This treaty took place after an invasion of Italy by one signatory after the other signatory invaded and burned Rome, and negotiations for this treaty were led by Louise of Savoy and Margaret of Austria, leading this treaty to be known as the Peace of the Ladies. Reducing the harsh terms of the Treaty of Madrid of four years prior and ending the War of the League of Cognac, for ten points, identify this treaty signed between Francis I of France and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1529.

answer: {Hispaniola}

This location was known to its original inhabitants as Quizqueya, and one conflict here ended with a local chief named Caonabo burning a colonial settlement.
