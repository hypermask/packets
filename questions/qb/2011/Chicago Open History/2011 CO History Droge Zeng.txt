answer: Landsknechts

These troops gave their name to a card game played with two “Hand Cards” in which players win wagers placed on cards when the dealer has their card matched by the top card of the deck. Often, their front lines were paid twice as much and uncharacteristically wielded two-handed swords. Their distinctive, colorful dress came from their habit of looting slain enemies for rags to wear. Their name, coined by Peter von Hagenbach, literally means “servant of the country,” and the first groups of them were recruited by Maxmilian I and Georg von Frundsberg, after which they fought in the Swabian War. A group of them known as the Black Band, led by George Langenmantel, were completely demolished at the Battle of Pavia by a different group of these soldiers. For 10 points, name these mercenary troops used during the 15th and 16th Centuries.

answer: {Zimmerman Telegram}

A crucial second copy of this document was obtained by one nation when an agent known as Mr. H bribed the head of a Western Union office to intercept it at its destination. That nation wished to use the second copy so as not to reveal that they had wiretapped a supposedly private line of communication. The lead up to this document’s creation saw arms supplied by the company of Krakauer, Zork, and Moye, and it urged one nation to make contact with Japan to proffer an offer of alliance. After the actions of the cable-dredging ship Telconia and a blockade by Eastern Telegraph, this document had to be sent through England,, meaning that it was intercepted and decoded at Room 40. For 10 points, name this document that offered financial aid and the promise of regaining Texas to Mexico if Mexico would enter into World War One against the U.S.
