answer: {Popham} Colony (accept {Sagadahoc Colony} before it is mentioned)

The Gift of God and the Mary and John transported the early residents of this town, whose founder was perhaps the only one to die and whose second leader was Raleigh Gilbert. This town’s central financier later sponsored Christopher Levett, who died while trying to found another settlement near this one. This settlement, which was sponsored by Ferdinando Gorges, was envisioned as a ship-building mecca and did manage to construct the Virginia of Sagadahoc. The center of this settlement was the star-shaped Fort St. George, which is central to John Hunt’s map of this place. This colony was founded on what is now the Kennebec River. For 10 points, name this short-lived northern offshoot of the Plymouth Company’s North American colonization project, located in Maine.

answer: the 2005 {French riots} (or 2005 {French race riots}; or {Paris race riots}; or anything {implying} that {France hates North Africans/Muslims} and {rioting ensued})

Descriptive answer is acceptable. Wikipedia notes that this event should not be confused with a donnybrook at a Grenoble tasting event, which “might just well be considered as predictable ‘wine festival’ casualties, caused by misunderstanding and alcohol.” Reporting on this event, the BBC quoted an amusing police report that “98 vehicles were torched on Wednesday night, marking a ‘return to a normal situation.’” The SRU law was enforced in the wake of this event, which spawned from urban planning in ZEPs. During this event, one figure earned the ire of Lilian Thuram by calling a group of people “scum” or “racaille.” This episode began when several soccer-playing youth in Clichy-sous-Bois fled police and hid in a power substation, causing two to be electrocuted. For 10 points, name these bouts of civil unrest in the Parisian suburbs under Jacques Chirac.

answer: {Frederick II}

Ten of The Hundred Old Tales feature this near-contemporary ruler, whose chancellor Pietro della Vigna is often credited with the first revival of Roman law since Justinian with his Constitutions of Melfi. This ruler created a bodyguard from the Saracen soldiers he established at Lucera, and his supporters included podestas such as Oberto Pelavicino and his son-in-law Ezzelino da Romano. After this ruler’s death, Edmund Crouchback made a claim to one his former possessions, ruled at the time by this man’s illegitimate son Manfred. The Council of Lyon was called to depose this ruler at the instigation of Innocent IV, and he also fought with Gregory IX. His marriage to Isabella of Jerusalem allowed him to claim that kingdom after leading the Sixth Crusade. For 10 points, name this King of Sicily and Holy Roman Emperor from 1220 to 1250, the grandson of Frederick Barbarossa.

answer: {Yuan Shikai}

While serving as Viceroy of Zhili, this man established the Luanzhou Mining Company to try to break the power of the British-controlled Kaiping company. This man led the forces that thwarted the Gapsin coup while he served as the “imperial resident” of the Chinese in Korea, and he betrayed the plot to assassinate Ronglu. Hu Hanmin was forced to flee China to escape this disciple of Li Hongzhang, and an unsuccessful uprising against him was led by Huang Xing and other former leaders of the Tongmenghui. This man came out of retirement to respond to the Wuchang Uprising, and he commanded China’s first modern military force, the Beiyang Army. This man’s death ushered in China’s Warlord period, and he probably ordered the assassinated of Song Jiaoren, who formed the Kuomingtang to opposed this man’s policies. For 10 points, name this first President of China, who unsuccessfully attempted to name himself emperor in 1915.

answer: {Stephen} (or {Stefan} )

One ruler of this name was defeated at Valea Alba after attempting to end his tribute to Bayezid II. This was the name of the father of Bogdan the One-Eyed who won the Battle of Vaslui and deposed Radu the Handsome. Another ruler of this name was the brother-in-law of Bayezid the Thunderbolt and first Despot of Serbia, who received his byname from his father, the defeated prince at the Battle of Kosovo. A ruler of this name from the Nemanjic dynasty promulgated a notable law code, fought against John Cantacuzenus, and conquered Macedonia and Albania, ushering in a golden age for Serbia. This name was held by a “great” Moldavian ruler, the Serbian despot Lazarevic, and the Serbian king Dushan. Another ruler with this name defeated an insurrection by his cousin Koppany, and that son of Geza and member of the Arpad dynasty was crowned on Christmas Day 1000. For 10 points, give this name of the first King of Hungary.

answer: Election of {1888}

This election saw Californian George Osgoodby pose as a British merchant to trap Sir Lionel Sackville-West into exposing the Democratic candidate as the British preference. In another scandal during this election, William Wade Dudley wrote a letter to Indiana’s county chairmen, telling them to divide “floater” voters into paid segments. This election, which saw the Murchison Letter and Blocks of Five scandals, resulted in a victory for Levi P. Morton’s ticket and ushered in the president who presided over the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, the McKinley Tariff, and the rest of the “Billion Dollar Congress” legislation. For 10 points, name this election in which Benjamin Harrison took down Grover Cleveland, who retook the presidency four years later.

answer: la {Violencia} (or the {Violence} )

A study of the causes of this period was authored by German Guzman Campos, and during this period the priest Pedro Maria Ramirez was suspected of hiding weapons in his church, leading a mob to kill him with machetes. An important figure in the cause of this period had previously formed the Left Revolutionary National Union. One leader during it attempted to enact reforms in concert with his daughter Maria Eugenia, but he was removed from power in response to a depression caused by a drop in coffee prices. In an election preceding this period, Gabriel Turbay split the vote, allowing Mariano Ospina Perez to take office. It ended when the Declaration of Sitges resulted in the creation of the National Front, and it included the presidency of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. This period ended with the coalition presidency of Alberto Lleras Camargo, and it began in 1946 with the assassination of Liberal leader Jorge Eliecer Gaitan. For 10 points, name this period of conflict between the Liberal and Conservative parties of Colombia.

answer: the {California gold rush} (prompt on partial answer; accept {discovery} of {gold} in {California} or other equivalents; accept {Forty}-{Niner gold rush} before “{forty}-{niner}”)

This event ruined plans for an agricultural utopia called New Helvetia. The Dame Shirley letters documented this event, which led to a certain area gaining the Chinese nickname “Gum San.” Poet Joaquin Miller documented this event’s effect on the native population in Life Amongst the Modocs. The Cliff House was constructed by an early participant, Star newspaper publisher Samuel Brannan, who took to the streets yelling about the American River shortly after this event began. So-called Argonauts participated in this event, which began after James W. Marshall alerted his boss about some residue in a lumber mill water wheel. For 10 points, name this event that was sparked by a discovery at Sutter’s Mill in 1848, leading bunch of forty-niners to flock to a certain state.

answer: {Flavius Stilicho}

A poem written for this man’s consulate suggests that he might have taken troops to Britain to fight the Saxons and Picts, and this man sent Mascezel to secure Rome’s grain supply and end the revolt of Gildo. This man defeated a force led by Radagaisus, and earlier repelled another invasion at Pollentia, and this rival of Rufinus was effusively praised in the poetry of his contemporary Claudian. This man’s daughters Maria and Thermantia each married the emperor, and he was accused of seeking to place his son Eucherius on the throne. He was brought to Ravenna and executed on suspicion of treason, and his role was largely assumed by Aetius after the ascension of Valentinian III. Soon after his death, his longtime enemy Alaric was able to sack Rome, and this man was notably half-Vandal. For 10 points, name this Roman general, the de facto ruler during the reign of Honorius.

answer: the {Don Pacifico} Affair (or {Dom Pacifico} ; or {David Pacifico} )

Animosity surrounding this event was heightened by the previous seizure of George Finlay’s garden. The outrages at the center of this event occurred on Easter Sunday when the presence of a Rothschild in the central city caused civic leaders to ban burning straw effigies of Judas, much to the chagrin of the sons of a government minister, who trashed a house in Psyrri while the police stood idly by. This event spawned the lengthy “Civis Romanus sum” speech, whose speaker stated that the man at this event’s center depended on the “watchful eye and the strong arm of England.” Because the man at the center of this embarrassment to King Otto was born on Gibraltar, he was a British subject, thus giving Palmerston justification to blockade Piraeus in a textbook example of gunboat diplomacy. For 10 points, name this affair centering on a namesake Portuguese Jew serving as a consul in Greece.

answer: Empire of {Nicaea} (accept {Iznik} )

One ruler of this place formed an alliance with John Asen II after the latter’s victory at Klokotnitsa over a rival claimant to the rulers of this place. Another ruler of this place was advised by George Muzalon, and a schism resulted when that man’s deposer was excommunicated by Arsenios Autoreianos. John Vatatzes was one ruler of this place, and another killed Kay-Khusraw in battle, and was opposed by Michael Doukas and David Komnenos. The empire centered here was founded by Theodore Laskaris, and its last ruler was a usurping general named Michael Palaiologos. Opposed by the Despotate of Epirus and the Empire of Trebizond, this city was home to a Byzantine successor state during the Latin Empire. A church council here accepted the veneration of icons, and another set the date of Easter and condemned Arianism. For 10 points, name this Turkish city which names a Christian creed.

answer: Adolphe {Thiers}

This leader blamed his downfall on Alphonse de Rothschild, though that man had provided loans for this leader to pay a five billion franc indemnity ahead of schedule. While Minister of Public Works, this man constructed the last wall built around Paris, and he popularized the maxim “the king reigns but does not govern.”  As Minister of Foreign Affairs, he almost caused a war with Britain in the Oriental Crisis of 1840, when he supported the Syrian campaign of Muhammad Ali. With Francois Mignet he founded the anti-Bourbon daily Le National, and this leading Orleanist was the chief rival of Francois Guizot in the July Monarchy. This man worked with Jules Favre to negotiate the Treaty of Frankfurt, and he sent Marshal MacMahon to restore order in the capital, resulting in the Bloody Week. For 10 points, name this man who put down the Paris Commune and was elected as first president of the French Third Republic.

Two sides in this conflict signed the Treaty of Tafna, which was broken when Robert Thomas Bugeaud turned on the other signatory in the Battle of the Smala. This conflict was the first in which baggy-pantsed troops dubbed “zoaves” served. Several years later, one player in this conflict rescued Christians in Damascus from a Druze massacre, thus becoming only Arab namesake of a U.S. city. That namesake of Elkader, Iowa, Abd Al-Qadir, led a prolonged resistance during this conflict, which was sparked when two Jews defaulted on a payment to Hussein Dey, who struck Pierre Deval with a fan as a result. Charles X ordered the 1830 invasion that sparked this conflict, which ended in 1847 and began with the ouster of Ottoman rule in the central country. For 10 points, name this conflict in which a European nation subjugated a nearby North African country after invading its capital, Algiers.

Carter Glass accused this body’s head of “dirt-daubing the sepulcher” of a former president in a speech whose key points Glass highlighted by pounding his fist on his desk until his knuckles bled while the rest of the Senate cheered him on. Dorothy Detzer supported this body, whose investigations spurred interest in the proposed Ludlow Amendment. The namesake of this body led the charge against “merchants of death,” resulting in support for the contemporary Neutrality Acts of the 1930s.

One of these events led to an observer asking “what do you think of the nerve of that big monkey?” about the person who did it. Three of these events occurred on a Wednesday in 1926 after the person who accomplished them promised Johnny Sylvester, who had fallen off of a horse, that he would do it at least once. Another of these events, the extraordinary circumstances of which were confirmed by eyewitness and future Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens, victimized Charlie Root after the person who did it pointed to center field. For 10 points, name these events that happened 60 times in 1927 and 714 times during the career of a certain former Red Sox pitcher.
