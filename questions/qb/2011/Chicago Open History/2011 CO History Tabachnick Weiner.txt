answer: {Hengist} and {Horsa} (prompt on {Jutes} before “the other one” is read)

One of these people is said, like Dido, to have used a long strip of leather made from a bull’s hide to acquire more land than anticipated, and to have acquired influence through the marriage of his daughter Rowena, in Geoffery of Monnouth’s account. One of these people used the code phrase “nemet oure saxes” as a signal to massacre 460 people; those people were then buried by Eldad, who later got revenge by arguing for the execution of one of these people following his capture by Aurelius Ambrosius. The other one is said to have died in battle at Aylesford. A son of one of these people became the king of Kent, which led to the dynastic name Oiscingas. These sons of Wihtgils landed at Ramsgate in order to fight the Picts on behalf of Vortigern. For 10 points, name these Jute brothers who became the first Anglo-Saxons in England.

answer: {China}-{Vietnam} War (or {Sino}-{Vietnamese} War; or {Third Indochina} War; or {Chi?n tranh biên gi?i Vi?t}-{Trung}; or {Chi?n tranh ch?ng bành tr??ng Trung Hoa}; or War Against {Chinese Expansionism}; or {Duì yuè zìwèi f?nj? zhàn}; or {Counterattack} against {Vietnam} in {Self}-{Defense})

One instigator of this war signaled his intentions to the American President by stating “children who don’t listen have to be spanked.” One analyst claimed that an unfulfilled aim of this war was for one party to form an alliance with the United States against the Soviets. Tangible events of this war included the capture or Cao Bang and Lang Son, as well as a propaganda campaign that labeled one side “the Cuba of the East.” Following this war, one participant engaged in ostentatious amphibious landing training on Hainan in order to intimidate the other. The main cause of this war was the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation which one side signed with the USSR in 1978, shortly before invading Cambodia. For 10 points, identify this month-long 1979 war, during which the People’s Liberation Army was dispatched by Deng Xiaoping across the Southern border.

answer: “{Ford} to {City}: {Drop Dead}”

The Treasury Secretary whose advice led to this headline was criticized by Victor Gotbaum as not believing in government beyond police and firefighting, “and he’s not sure about fire.” That man, William Simon, inspired this headline by advocating an alternative program involving the end of rent control and subsidized tuition as well as a rise in transit fares. Though it accompanied a story by Frank Van Riper about a speech condeming “insidious spending” at the National Press Club, this headline was composed by William J. Brink. Its impact led to a three-percent loss in a 41-electoral-vote state, and thus the loss of re-election to the Presidency, for the person attributed within this headline. A competing paper covered the same story with a headline that read “asserts he’d veto fund guarantee, offers bankrupcty bill.” For 10 points, identify this 1975 Daily News headline about the President’s refusal to authorize federal bailout money for New York.

answer: {German South-West Africa} (or {Deutsch-Südwestafrika} )

This colony got its started when a merchant got some land from local chief Joseph Fredericks after landing at Angra Pequeña Bay. One group from this territory destroyed a railway bridge at Okhandja and lost the Battle of Hamakari, after which they were forced to flee this location on the “Trail of Bones”. General Lothar von Trotha won the aforementioned battle. Walvis Bay was an enclave in this territory. During World War I, this territory was attacked at Ramansdrift in an offensive leading to the ultimate end of this colony once it was given as a mandate to its eastern neighbor. After Hendrik Witbooi’s unsuccessful rebellion in this territory, its Nama and Herero peoples were savagely killed by this colony’s rulers. Starting in 1890, this territory touched the Zambezi thanks to a strip of land ceded to it named after Chancellor Georg von Caprivi. Including the city of Windhoek, for 10 points, name this colony which lasted from 1884 to 1915, the predecessor of modern-day Namibia which was controlled from Berlin.

Another of these people, Molly Johnson, was married to a British major general in charge of Iriquois relations. Molly’s brother was a commander at the Battle of Oriskany and was the great rival of the Seneca Red Jacket. That one took the name Joseph Brandt and was the leader of the pro-British faction of Iriquois during the American Revolution. Earlier, this group’s 1629 attack on Silley instigated the Beaver Wars. Known as the “keepers of the eastern door” for their position as the easternmost member of the Iriquois, they were also called “man-eaters” by their great rivals in the fur trade.

answer: the {Tanaka Memorial}

One article about this document relates that Felix Dzerzhinsky paid three thousand dollars for it, and that Nikolai Bukharin confused it for a poem, before vouching for its authenticity. That article about how this document was smuggled to the USSR was written by Leon Trotsky. Another person claimed that there was a large internal conspiracy to secretly enter the Imperial Library and make a copy of this document in order to achieve internal political aims by weakening the reputation of the man who led the Friends of Constitutional Government. James Cagney starred in a film based on a fictional scenario in which this document is smuggled to the United States, Blood on the Sun, and it is heavily featured in Frank Capra’s Why We Fight. Beginning “In order to take over the world, you need to take over China” and then pointing out that Manchuria is the key to China, this document was attributed to the prime minister from 1927 to 1929. For 10 points, identify this blueprint for world domination by Japan, whose authenticity is still debated but which largely matched Japan’s actual World War II strategy.

answer: the {Sultanate} of {Rum}

A hospital complex built under the rule of this state was known in honor of the consumptive princess Gevher Nesibe. This country faced several attempts to seize the throne from the sons of a deposed ruler who had been exiled to the Crimea, Kaykaus. This state suffered a monumental defeat to Bayju’s Mongol army at Kose Dag. A leader of this polity patronized the founding of the Mawlawiyah order in its capital by Rumi. That capital was also the site of the Karatay Madrassa, and that rule, Kay-Qubad, made a strategic error by destroying the buffer state of Khwarezem. This state was ruled from Konya and named for the fact that it occupied former Byzantine territory, and it was the political successor of the unorganized Seljuk armies. For 10 points, identify this eleventh to thirteenth century power which controlled Anatolia immediately prior to the rise of the Ottomans.

answer: the {United States occupation} of {Haiti} (or obvious equivalents)

The wisdom of this program was questioned by the Forbes Commission, which was set up to analyze this strategy after ten peasants were massacred during a protest at Les Cayes. William Caperton supervised the first stages of this event, which included preventing Rosalvo Bobo from running for president. The immediate spark for this event was the capture and dismemberment of Guillaume Sam, whose body was paraded through the streets by caco militiamen. During this event, Franklin Roosevelt boasted of personally writing a certain constitution, and campaigns against malaria and yaws began, along with the imposition of racial segregation. Lasting from 1913 to 1934, it ended with the election of Stenio Vincent. For 10 points, identify this military endeavor which began when Woodrow Wilson ordered Marines to Hispaniola.

answer: {Prime Minister} of {Italy}

One man in this position resigned for the first time after handling the Achille Lauro hijacking. A former holder of this position was acquitted in 2003 of killing a journalist who implicated the anti-Communist “stay-behind” organization Gladio, the existence of which was only acknowledged a decade after the journalist’s death. Those two were members of the so-called CAF alliance of party leaders which controlled their country’s government for a stretch. One aforementioned holder of this position helped put Zine Ben Ali in power in Tunisia, then fled there after being one of many former holders of this position implicated in the Tangentopoli scandal revealed fully by the “clean hands” investigations. Another holder of this position proposed an alliance between his country’s Christian Democrats and Communists before being taken hostage and eventually shot by the Red Brigades. The current holder of this position hosts “bunga bunga” parties in his villa attended by guests like a 17-year-old Moroccan woman named Ruby. For 10 points, name this position held by Bettino Craxi, Aldo Moro, and Silvio Berlusconi.

answer: {Nathanael Greene}

Due to a slight limp, this man was only allowed to be a private in a militia he helped form, the Kentish Guard. Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin while working for this man’s widow at his estate of Mulberry Grove. He chaired the commission that sent John André to the gallows after replacing Benedict Arnold in command at West Point. He appointed John Cox and Charles Pettit as assistants in a role in which he replaced Thomas Mifflin, that of Quartermaster General. This general followed forces under James Stuart to Charleston after defeating them at Eutaw Springs. Earlier, this man had divided the troops under his control, forcing Cornwallis to do the same, a strategy which led to the British force being weakened despite this man’s loss at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. For 10 points, name this Rhode Island–born Revolutionary War general who replaced Horatio Gates as commander-in-chief of the southern army.

answer: the {Marble Boat} (or {Shifang} )

Eleven centuries before this object was actually built, a metaphor about it was used by Wei Zheng to explain how the same people who support the emperor could depose him. It is located near the Shizhang Pavilion, at the opposite end of the Long Corridor from the Gate of Inviting the Moon. It was built by Qianlong in 1755 to symbolize the eternity of the Qing Dynasty and destroyed during the Second Opium War, only to be rebuilt, including four dragon heads, for use as a “pure banquet” location and a platform for viewing naval exercises on Kunming Lake. For 10 points, identify this folly on which Dowager Empress Cixi squandered the budget for naval modernization, which symbolically sunk China’s modernization much as it would always sink due to its composition.

answer: {Saxony} (or {Sachsen} or {Saxe} )

An early vernacular law code compiled by Eike von Repkow was used in this region and was known as its “mirror”. This region was granted a constitution in 1831 and was ruled for almost twenty years by Frederick Augustus II. Descendants of Frederick the Warlike squabbled over the possessions of the House of Wettin centered on this region, leading to a split between its eastern Albertine and western Ernestine lands, the latter of which were a set of duchies named for this region in Thuringia. Henry the Lion ruled the duchy here for the House of Welf until Frederick Barbarossa broke it up. The Liudolfing dynasty of Holy Roman Emperors is sometimes named after this region, since its first ruler, Henry the Fowler, was duke of this region. One city in this region lent its name to a British ruling house whose last member, Victoria, married the son of the duke of one duchy named for this region, that of Coburg and Gotha. For 10 points, name this region in Germany which lent its name to one of the tribes that conquered England.

answer: Nathaniel {Macon}

Late in life, this resident of the Buck Spring plantation presided over a convention that eliminated the right of free blacks to vote and changed requirements for office from being Protestant to merely being Christian. In addition to presiding over the 1835 North Carolina constitutional convention, this disciple of Willie Jones succeeded Theodore Sedgwick to become Speaker of the House for almost the entire Jefferson administration. During his time in Congress, he became notorious for voting “no” on almost all legislation, including an act that he himself had introduced which provided that, should either Britain or France normalize trade with the United States, the other country would be subject to an American trading ban. For 10 points, name this anti-federalist who attempted to replace the Non-Intercourse Act with his namesake “bill number two.”

answer: Anna {Ivanovna} (or {Anna Ioannovna} )

This figure’s biographer described her “Amazon complex”, helped by her habit of getting people to drive animals from a forest into a field, whereupon she would drive up in a carriage and shoot all of them. Her wedding was paired with that of her uncle’s favorite dwarf, and her teenaged husband died during the festivities of alcohol poisoning after getting into a drinking contest with that uncle. That husband had been the Duke of Courland. After the Supreme Privy Council put this woman in power, she promptly abolished it. Ivan Lazhechnikov wrote a novel about this ruler’s court, which included the cabinet member Artemiy Volynsky and her lover Ernst Biron. That novel described a massive celebration culminating in the marriage of this ruler’s servant, a hunchbacked Kalmyk named Buzheninova, and a jester of hers, Prince Mikhail Golitsyn, or Kvasnik; this woman forced the two to spend their wedding night naked in a house made of ice, where they almost died. For 10 points, name this crazy daughter of Ivan V and niece of Peter the Great who ruled Russia from 1730 to 1740.

The first of these documents is lost, and a third-person account describing the exploits of figures like Diego Velasquez, Juan de Grijalba, and the author of these is often included with them. The last of them attacks the bureaucracy “obscuring the eyes of” the addressee in describing his failed actions in Honduras. In the second of these, the author negotiates with Panfilo de Narvaez. One of these describes a thriving market in a city in the middle of a salt lake, which is also home to the opulent palace of an emperor who tells the author that his ancestors had emigrated here. That one also mentions the author’s interpreter, La Malinche, and tells of his defeat on La Noche Triste. These documents describe similar information to a history written later by their author’s secretary, Bernal Díaz. The aforementioned city is Temixtitlan, while the emperor is Montezuma. For 10 points, name this set of five documents in which a conquistador describes his exploits against the Aztecs to a Spanish emperor.
