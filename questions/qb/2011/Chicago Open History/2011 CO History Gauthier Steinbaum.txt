answer: Elam

One important center of this polity was at Tall-i Malyan, while another was the short lived city of D?r-Untaš [dur untash] at modern Choga Zanbil. This polity was a battleground between the kingdom of Marhashi and the rulers of Agade, and one third-millennium ruler of it invented a still undeciphered “linear” script. Home to the Awan and Shimaski dynasties, another dynasty to rule this polity took the title Sukkalmah and formed a coalition with Eshnunna against Hammurabi and his allies. Another king from this polity captured Enlil-n?din-ahi, ending the Kassite dynasty, while an earlier king had brought an end to the third dynasty of Ur. A major center at Susa marked, for 10 points, what Iranian kingdom that was the perennial foe of Mesopotamian empires?

answer: {Gdansk} (or {Danzig} )

One siege of this city aimed at overthrowing Stanislaw Leszczynski [“Lechinsky”], whose daughter was married to Louis XV and who thus enjoyed French as well as Swedish support. Russian forces under the Irishman William de Lacy were victorious after the French fleet was forced to withdraw from Westerplätte in 1734, ending that war in Russia’s favor with the ascension of the Saxon candidate Augustus III. An earlier siege of this city in 1577 ended inconclusively, with this city gaining an independent charter from Stefan Bathory in exchange for supporting his claim to the throne of Poland and paying a huge ransom. Those events are alluded to by the fictitious Oskar Matzerath after he participates in the Defense of the Polish Post Office, which took place in this city on September 1, 1939 and constituted Nazi Germany’s overthrow of the Free State instituted in this city by the Treaty of Versailles. For 10 points, name this now-Polish Hanseatic city where Lech Walesa led the first Solidarity strike.

answer: {feces} (accept equivalents, {especially guano})

Conflict over this economic resource was the defining characteristic of the Chincha Islands War, during which a Spanish fleet seized the islands, ostensibly in place of reparations for the Talambo Incident. This resource is also responsible for the past wealth and current poverty of the island of Nauru, and in 1856 the US Congress passed an act that recognized any American claims to islands containing this resource. Though this resource isn’t coffee, Kopi Luwak could be considered the most expensive form of this resource. For 10 points, name this economic resource used more commonly as fertilizer and explosives, the solid waste product of animal digestive systems.

answer: Tahiti

This island featured a group of young, itinerant religious personnel known as Arioi, and one king of this island regained power at the battle of Feii. The father of that ruler was aided by his good relations with the London Missionary Society in unifying the island, and his great-grandson was deposed, ending the dynasty. That dynasty also saw the fifty-year reign of queen ?Aimata, during whose rule the Consul George Pritchard was expelled by admiral Dupetit Thouars. Home to the Pomare dynasty, its monarchy was abolished by the French in 1880. For 10 points, identify this island in French Polynesia, a sojourn on which led to the Mutiny on the Bounty.

answer: Siberia

This region was the focus of the missionary efforts of Macarius II, and the battle of Chuvash Cape saw the Kuchum, leader of its eponymous polity, expelled by forces under Yermak. Johann Georg Gmelin and Gerhard Friedrich Müller were part of the 18th century Great Northern Expedition sent to this region, and indigenous peoples from this region were required to pay the Yasak tax. Southern expansion from this region was halted by the Treaty of Nerchinsk, and it was also home to the Evenki, the Buryats, and the Yukaghirs. Home to many adherents of a religious sect led by the priest Avakum, the south east of this region included the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. Named for the Khanate of Siber, this was, for 10 points what large eastern region of Russia?

answer: Republic of {Genoa}

Members of this polity squeezed Philip II by stopping the payment of gold to his troops in the Netherlands, which eventually led to unpaid troops looting Antwerp. This polity had become a major Spanish banking hub after the decline of the Fuggers. This polity ruled Corsica for over 400 years, and for much of the thirteenth century it controlled Caffa in the Crimea. This polity allied with Michael VIII Paleologus to overthrow the Latin Empire of Constantinople and it defeated a Pisan fleet at the battle of Meloria. It was incorporated into the Ligurian Republic by Napoleon and defeated by Venice in the War of Chioggia. For 10 points, identify this northeastern Italian city that was home to a maritime republic and the birthplace of Andrea Doria and Christopher Columbus.

answer: the {Aztec} Empire (or the {Triple Alliance} )

Under the ruler Water Mask, this polity suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the Tarascan empire, and a large portion of its agricultural production came from “floating gardens.” It had a system of universal education with commoners sent to the telpohcalli (tel-poch-CAL-li), and nobility to the calmecac (cal-ME-cac), and it often used the murder of its pochteca (poch-TE-ca) merchants as an excuse for war. Described at length in the Florentine Codex of Bernardino de Sahagún., the ruler of one of its three ruling cities, Fasting Coyote, was famed as a poet in the Nahuatl (NA-wa-tl) language. A series of defeats let to the poisoning of Tizoc, and to regain credibility with his vassals, his successor Ahuitzotl (a-WI-tzo-tl) sacrificed 80,000 captives during the re-dedication of one of the main temples. For 10 points, identify this empire last ruled by Mocteuczoma (mo-tequ-SO-ma) Xocoyotl (sho-CO-yo-tl) from its capital at Tenochtitlan.

answer: Charleston

A bombardment of this city by a fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Peter Parker on June 28th, 1776 proved unsuccessful due to the construction of the fort at the southern end of Sullivan’s Island. The second British attempt to capture this city, again at the overall direction of Henry Clinton, involved troops shifted from New York and Newport, who landed on James Island and captured this city after a six-week siege, including the surrender of 5000 continental troops under Benjamin Lincoln on May 12, 1780. That defeat sparked the guerrilla campaign of Francis Marion. For 10 points, name the commercial center of the southern colonies, then the capital of South Carolina.

answer: {Mycenean} Greece

Polities from this period and region had officials called lawagetas and the equetai were associated with their leaders. The leader himself was known as a wanax, while guasileus was a type of chief. Its archaeological remains include two famous circles of shaft graves and tholos tombs. Also known for cyclopean wallas and the Lion Gate, there is a long running debate whether it is to be identified with Ahhiyawa in Hittite texts. Tripods and chariots both appear in administrative documents from this period and region, and its end has been linked to the arrival of the Sea Peoples. It constructed palaces at Tyrins, Pylos, and Knossos and used the Linear B writing system. For 10 points, identify this civilization of late Bronze Age Greece named for the capital of Agamemnon.

answer: {last names} (accept equivalents, {including surnames} )

One group of these entities are thought to arise from parts in medieval passion plays, which were locally hereditary, such as “Maiden” and “Death.” In Quebec, examples of these entities were once preceded by the word “dit” as in “one says,” in which case they often to refer to geographic features. The diffusion of these entities is nearly always a state-led enterprise to facilitate taxation, as the spread of their use in medieval England was broadly from south to north and from upper classes to lower, in line with the population’s interaction with officialdom as it expanded. A Prussian state edict of 1812 offered full citizenship to Jews on the condition they take on one of these entities, and over the course of the nineteenth century that emancipatory tendency was replaced by the requirement that Jews assume one from a closed list, such as “Rubenstein” or “Hirsch.” For 10 points, what is this identifier, the most common of which is “Smith” in the US?

answer: Miltiades

This man inherited his initial political power from his namesake and great uncle, who likely fled Athens having opposed the Pisistratids, though Herodotus recounts he left of his own accord to rule over several Athenian colonies in the Thracian Chersonese as the result of an oracle. This man ruled that area, the present Gallipoli, as a tyrant. He offered homage to Darius I and participated in the latter’s anti-Scythian operations, but he later joined the Ionian Revolt. The ensuing failure forced this man to take refuge in Athens, where he was nonetheless held prisoner as a tyrant but secured release upon protesting his opposition to Persia. He was then made strategos, in which capacity he earned his greatest fame, convincing the War Archon Callimachus to fight the Persians in 490 BC. For 10 points, name this victorious general of the Battle of Marathon.

answer: {Joseph Kennedy} (or {Joe Kennedy}; prompt on “{Kennedy}” or “{J. Kennedy}”)

This man lost one appointment when he said that “fighting for democracy” is “bunk” in a newspaper interview. This man orchestrated the sending of a million telegrams to Congress in order to intimidate the Roosevelt administration out of repealing the arms embargo on Republican Spain, mimicking Fascist propaganda about atrocities committed against monasteries there. This man offered to finance the nascent 1956 presidential campaign of Lyndon Johnson on the condition that Johnson promise to make a certain selection for the vice presidency, an offer that Johnson rejected, not needing the money and not wanting to generate a rival for the Democratic nomination in 1960. That’s exactly what happened regardless. For 10 points, name this first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to whom FDR reportedly gave the job because “it takes a crook to catch one.”

answer: {James} I of England (or {James VI} of Scotland)

Corona Regia, a satire in the form of an encomium to this king, praises him for elevating John Ramsay and Robert Carr to the peerage for paederastical reasons. The former’s honor occurred after he stabbed the Earl of Gowrie, thereby defending this king from an assassination attempt. Carr was this king’s main advisor after the death of Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, prompted this king to attempt to rule largely independent of council, and this king granted a divorce to Frances Howard to marry Carr. Howard and perhaps Carr conspired to poison Thomas Overbury while he was imprisoned in the Tower for disobeying this king and, essentially, for opposing Howard influence, in a major scandal during this man’s reign. For 10 points, name this king who imagined himself the victim of an attempted bewitching at sea and so instigated the North Berwick witch trials and who really was the intended victim of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605.

answer: {taxes}

An official called a defterdar was responsible for implementing these measures, which were typically auctioned off via the muqata’ah. The haraj was the most important one of these measures during the reign of Mehmet II by an order of magnitude or more. Haraj could be considered an example of jizya, which signified a higher status than zakat during the early Islamic period, since the latter was associated with nomads while the former pertained to Christians, members of the community of the faithful. Devshirme may be considered a form of this, in that case paid in kind as it enslaved children to the Ottoman state, where they came to be a ruling class. For 10 points, these are all Islamic examples of what type of coercive measures enacted to finance state activities?

answer: {Austria-Hungary} (do not prompt on {separate} names)

Forces from this polity during this war were routed at the battle of Kolubara. Its principal armed forces were known by the abbreviation KUK, and it would later see an end to hostilities with the armistice of Villa Giusti. A force of 60,000 defectors originally from this polity formed the “legions” that briefly occupied the Trans-Siberian railroad, and it suffered its last major defeat in this war at Vittorio Veneto. Conrad von Hötzendorf’s attempt to relieve this polity’s besieged fortress of Przemysl led to a disastrous campaign in the Carpathians, and its army was unable to recover from its 750,000 casualties in the Brusilov offensive. Its most spectacular success came at Caporetto. Embarrassingly defeated by Serbia at the outbreak of the war, this was, for 10 points, what nation whose attack on Serbia started the First World War?

answer: {Gotha} Program

This document, in calling for “socialistic productive associations,” displayed the influence of Ferdinand Lassalle. The adoption of this document constituted a rapprochement between Lassalle’s ADAP, which had cooperated with Bismarck’s policies, and the anti-Prussian Eisenach faction of Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel. This document promised universal suffrage, a universal income tax, unlimited right of association, a ban on child labor, and workplace safety inspections, and it promised to “abolish exploitation of every kind” and to “bring the brotherhood of all mankind to a full realization.” Nonetheless, this document earned criticism in an open letter that articulated the principle “from each according to his ability; to each according to his need,” and this document was eventually replaced by the more orthodox Erfurt program, which called for nationalization of industry. For 10 points, name this 1875 founding platform of the SPD of which Karl Marx wrote a famous “critique.”
