answer: diffusion

The cage effect partially describes the relationship between the reaction rate and the rate at which this process occurs; those reactions are limited not by activation but by this process. It is roughly inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. This process is modeled by Fick's Laws, which involve the spatial derivatives of concentration. When water undergoes this process, it is called osmosis. For 10 points, name this net mass movement of solute from higher concentrations to lower concentrations.
