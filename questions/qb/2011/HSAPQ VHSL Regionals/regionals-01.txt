answer: {cyanide} [or CN- before it is read]

This ion is combined with iron in Prussian blue. Compounds of this ion are used in the standard process for extracting gold and silver from ore. When this is not an ion, but instead covalently bonded in an organic molecule, the molecule is called a nitrile. Since it inhibits cytochrome c (SITE-oh-chrome see) oxidase, it is capable of stopping aerobic cellular respiration. That is the mechanism behind its most common usages, including insecticides. For 10 points, name this ion with formula CN minus that is poisonous and is consequently used in suicide pills.
