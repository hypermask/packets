answer: {dark} matter [prompt on {WIMPs} until {concept}]

The project AMANDA uses neutrino telescopes to find physical evidence of it, while the current standard model of cosmology is named for “lambda-cold” form of this substance.

answer: {enthalpy} [accept {H} until “ {H} ” is read]

Though not superconductivity, Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes coined its name. It remains constant when gases are forced through a pipe in the Joule-Thomson effect. For quasistatic processes at constant pressure, one can use standard state values of this quantity, independent of [*] reaction pathway, to calculate change in this quantity using Hess's law. Positive values of it denote endothermic reactions while negative ones indicate exothermic reactions. Though not heat, it has a standard ‘change of formation', and can be given as internal energy plus pressure times volume. For 10 points, name this thermodynamic property used to calculate heat transfer, symbolized H.
