answer: {Hooke's} Law

For anisotropic substances, this law can be represented using Voigt notation; it can be derived by defining deformation as adiabatic. Cauchy adapted this law to three-dimensional bodies; in three dimensions, a 4th order tensor with 81 coefficients must be applied for this law to hold; it is called the [*] stiffness tensor. This law holds only in the elastic range, below the yield strength, and Young's modulus is the ratio of stress and strain over that range. For 10 points, identify this law often applied to springs, defined by setting the restoring force equal to the negative of the spring constant k times displacement.
