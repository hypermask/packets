answer: {Stock} clues [Prompt on “{clues}”]

An especially old one of these entities states that the cup bearer of the king of Kish was Sargon the Great, while another notes that an individual tutored by Bairam Khan was named Akbar. Another of these entities concerns the apprenticeship of Michael Faraday to a bookbinder. Though the “invisible hand” is not one, the “pin factory” example may be one for The Wealth of Nations, and another opening with the words “Inscribed on a cocktail napkin” describes the Laffer curve. For zero points, identify this term for clues that have been used so often that they are reflex-buzzed by quizbowl players with no context for the clue's information.

Poincaré's disk and half-plane models describe this kind of space. This type of partial differential equation includes the one-dimensional wave function, and the shape of a catenary is modeled by this type of [*] cosine. Lobachevsky developed its type of geometry, which allows for infinite parallel lines between a line and a point. The reciprocal function is an example of this object defined by two oblique asymptotes and an eccentricity greater than one.

answer: {Krebs} cycle [accept {citric acid cycle} until read]

This process can be regulated by calcium's activation of isocitrate dehydrogenase. In its third step, two molecules of carbon dioxide leave to form alpha-ketoglutarate. At the beginning of this process, two molecules of carbon dioxide are stripped to form an [*] acetaldehyde intermediate, which later becomes acetyl-CoA, and the last step of this process uses FAD to transform two molecules of fumarate to malate. Beginning with two molecules of pyruvate and producing NADH, for 10 points, identify this component of cell respiration between glycolysis and electron transport, sometimes known as the citric acid cycle.

As a micronutrient, this element interacts with calcium in plants and helps maintain their cell walls. In an alloy with neodymium and iron, atoms of this element form the strongest permanent magnets. Found in colemanite and the optically bizarre ore ulexite, this element's [*] hydride contains ‘banana bonds' and is a Lewis acid. Its oxide is found with silica in labware made of Pyrex glass, and this lightest element with electrons in a p-shell usually requires six valence electrons to be stable, violating the octet rule. For 10 points, name this nonmetal element with atomic number 5 and symbol B.

The Leontief paradox refers to the fact that the United States exports goods associated with high level of this, and Marx distinguished the “concrete” form of this concept from the “abstract” form, which he used as a universal measure of [*] value.

Along with land and capital, it is a major factor of production, and its cost is called wage. For 10 points, give the name for work done by human capital, which employees sell to employers.
