answer: {black holes}

A method of removing energy from these objects was proposed by Roger Penrose because the Lense-Thirring effect creates frame-dragging around the Kerr and Kerr-Newman, or rotating, type of them. They only have three externally quantifiable properties according to the [*] no-hair theorem – charge, mass, and angular momentum. For a certain mass, the Schwarzchild radius gives the event horizon for one of these. Thought to evaporate via Hawking radiation, these are, for 10 points, what massive celestial objects from which even light cannot escape?
