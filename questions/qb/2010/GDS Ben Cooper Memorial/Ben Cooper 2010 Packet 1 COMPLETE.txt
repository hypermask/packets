answer: {benzene} [accept {C6H6} until read]

This substance is reacted with sodium and an alcohol in the Birch reduction, and it is acylated through the use of a Lewis acid catalyst in the Friedel-Crafts acylation. This substance is produced through the catalytic reforming process, and linking two molecules of this substance forms biphenyl. When a [*] methyl group is attached to this substance, toluene is formed. With a structure famously described by August Kekulé, this substance's alternating double bonds make it the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon. For 10 points, identify this ring-shaped hydrocarbon with formula C6H6.
