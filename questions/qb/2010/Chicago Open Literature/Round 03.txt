answer: {golden} [accept {inflected} forms]

The Latin line "mollia luteola pingit vaccinia calta" is an example of a line that is often described by this adjective, because it consists of two adjectives and two substantives "with a verb betwixt to keep the place." Figures like Cicero and Vergil belong to a time period described by this adjective according to a William Teuffel book, because they used a (*) high form of Classical Latin. It also appears in a title of a Niccolo Machiavelli adaptation that features a character that eats a crown of roses before becoming a priest for the goddess Isis. Ovid describes how an ability described with this adjective was erased when its user went to Pactolus, and washed it off. For 10 points, name this adjective that also describes Apuleius's Ass, which can also describe the material found in the titular pot of a Plautus play. [Ike]
