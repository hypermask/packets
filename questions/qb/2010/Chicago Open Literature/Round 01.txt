answer: {Decolonizing} the {Mind}

This book's introduction claims that Guyanese poet Martin Carter wrote a poem expressing its main idea. It describes a "cultural bomb" that annihilates people's belief in their names, homes and languages. It criticizes Franz Josef Straus's visit to the President of Togo in 1984, then goes on to discuss the author's fascination with the Faust theme, which would inform his novel written on toilet paper while in prison. It gives two reasons for the rise of the novel in his homeland: the printing press and the growth of universities there in the 1950's. Spending five pages reproducing the text of (*) I Will Marry when I Want in its section "The Language of African Theatre," this book claims that speaking a language like Spanish or Portuguese distances oneself from the culture of their native tongue. For 10 points, name this seminal essay subtitled "The politics of language in African literature," written by Ngugi wa Thiongo.  [Ike]

One of them opens with Jophiel attacking the Rosicrucian view of Merefool, and is notable because its stage design calls for a floating island. A different one sees twelve women come from the House of Fame to interrupt a witch dancing with her disciples.

answer: {Ernst Junger}

With Eric Remarque, this author appears humming a tune about Flanders in Gunter Grass's My Century. Adolf Hitler's admiration for this writer led to him receiving a signed copy of his Fire and Blood, ironic because this author warned against Nazism in On the Marble Cliffs. Although many find his dystopian works like The Glass Bees amusing, others are fascinated by his account of his repeated wounding in battles like Passchendaele and Arras during the fourteen different times he was hospitalized during World War 1, for his goal was to die gloriously in battle. For 10 points, name this German author of Storm of (*) Steel.  [Ike]

answer: {Lucy} Poems

Towards the end of one of them, the “mornings showed, / the night concealed” certain bowers, and that one sees its narrator among the mountains, where he felt “the joy of [his] desire.” A different one of them describes “grace” that “shall mould the” form of one figure “by silent sympathy.” That one begins by having Nature declare “A lovelier flower on earth was never sown.” Another one describes its subject as someone who “roll'd round in (*) earth's diurnal course, with rocks, and stones, and trees,” while another one claims “I will dare to tell, but in the Lover's ear alone, what once to me befell.” For 10 points, “A Slumber did my Spirit Seal” and “Strange Fits of Passion have I Known” are what Wordsworth poems named for their addressee?

answer: Pierre {Corneille}

This author put forth a "theatrical fiction" akin to a "legal fiction," by describing a room in multiple apartments at once in which characters can speak in secrecy. That idea was put forth in a text that attacked both Aristotle's critique of the chariot deus ex machina in Medea and his insistence that "complication," and "resolution" are the two components of a plot, because this author contends complication "depends entirely on the imagination of the poet." That text is Discourse on the Classical Unities. That discourse was written after one of his plays was the subject of a smear campaign by (*) Cardinal Richelieu and the French Academy, even though he would regain the favor of both by writing a play in which the title figure faces the three Curiatii brothers. In that first play, the title character and Don Sancho duel for Chimene. For 10 points, name this author that adapted a poem about a Spanish soldier into Le Cid.  [Ike]

answer: Alfred Lord {Tennyson}

In one of this author's poem, the speaker thinks he sees "the angel there that holds the crown" claiming to "know thy glittering face." That poem's speaker believes he will perish "to-night, a quarter before twelve." In another poem, the speaker imagines a man as "lean as death" who rode across a "wither'd heath" and stops at a hotel addressing a "Wrinkled ostler, thin and grim," "bitter barmaid, waning fast" and "slipshod waiter lank and sour." That poem begins with a man getting off a winged horse and going inside a palace with the child of sin, while that first poem is written in the style of Robert Browning and describes a (*) saint that had stayed on a column for three years. Another poem of his describes a figure who "knows not what the curse may be / and so she weaveth steadily," and describes an "island in the river flowing down to Camelot." For 10 points, name this author that included images of "long fields of barley and rye" in his "The Lady of Shallot."  [Ike]
