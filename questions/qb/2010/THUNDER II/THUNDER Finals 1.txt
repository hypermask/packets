answer: {Integrins} (prompt on {glycoproteins})

The RGD domain of von Willebrand factor binds to one of these proteins, and the anti-angiogenic factor cilengitide binds to one of these. The receptor for adenovirus is one of these molecules. Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia is caused by a defect in one of these proteins. The anticoagulant monoclonal antibody abciximab attacks one of these proteins, which binds to fibrinogen in an ADP-dependent manner. The N-termini of their alpha-subunits bind to divalent cations. The binding of talin binds to and activates these proteins, which can trigger the activity of focal adhesion kinases. These heavily glycosylated proteins consist of a heterodimer of an alpha and beta subunit, which bind to collagen and other extracellular matrix components. For 10 points, name these cell surface proteins named for the fact that they are integral to the cell membrane.

answer: {Albert Schweitzer}

After World War II, this man wrote two books decrying colonialism titled after “the primeval forest.” This man delivered a speech that cites the dangerousness of strontium-90 to health studies of residents nearby Nagasaki to conclude the abolishment of nuclear proliferation will be similar to “rays of sunlight” that humanity hopes for in his “A Declaration of Conscience” speech. His doctrine of “To be in awe of the mystery of life” or the “reverence of life” led him to write The (*) Decay and Restoration of Civilization. This Bach-enthusiast and author of The Mystery of the Kingdom of God and The Psychiatric Study of Jesus also wrote a book that attempts to give a fact based biography of the titular New Testament figure.

answer: Election of 1964

In the Republican primaries prior to this presidential election, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. won the New Hampshire primary on a write-in vote organized by amateurs on a whim without Lodge's support. The controversial film Choice was made to promote the losing candidacy in this election. At the Democratic convention, Fannie Lou Hamer and other Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates attempted to be seated. During this election, Ronald Reagan achieved national prominence by giving his “A Time for Choosing” speech in support of the losing candidate. This election saw the first Republican victories in the Deep South since Reconstruction and the losing candidate in this election was maligned for making statements like “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,” and was painted as a warmonger by the famous “Daisy” TV advertisement. For 10 points, name this election year in which Lyndon Johnson retained the presidency by thrashing Barry Goldwater.

answer: {Strangeness} (accept {strange quark})

In 2001, the KEK PS E373 created of particles that consist of a doublet of this property in the NIAGRA event. Farhi and Jaffe created a model of stable matter with this property. The horizontal lines on a baryon decuplet diagram show particles with equal amounts of this property, which was postulated when a certain particle had a measured lifetime 13 orders of magnitude greater than its predicted lifetime. The lambda and omega baryons have this property, and first-order weak interactions usually change this property by 1. Adding this property to the baryon number, multiplying the quantity by one-half, and adding the isospin gives the hypercharge according to the original Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula. K-mesons contain this particle along with either an up or down quark or antiquark. For 10 points, name this second-generation quark flavor discovered along with charm.

answer: Sir Noël Peirce {Coward}

In one play by this author, a couple utters the word “Sollocks” to prevent their arguments from getting out of hand. In another play, a character complains about a “gothic edition of Wembley Stadium” after discussing the affairs of Henry Lyppiatt. That play describes a sort of family formed by the members of Garry Essendine's crew, all of whom buy tickets to Africa, and was double-billed with this author's play This Happy Breed. Ruth gets killed driving a car sabotaged by the medium Madame Arcati in one play by this author, who loved having his characters tiptoe off-stage as the curtain dropped. In addition to writing Present Laughter and (*) Private Lives, this author wrote about the Bliss family in one play and a play about Charles Condomine that takes its title from Shelley's “To a Skylark.” For 10 points, identify this classy English dramatist who wrote Hay Fever and Blithe Spirit.

answer: {Cologne} Cathedral (accept {Kölner Dom}, {Hoher Dom zu Köln}, {Hohe Domkirche St. Peter und Maria})

Federico Fellini built a set of this building, only to tear it down unfilmed.  Major works of art here include the Milan Madonna, choir screen paintings of Saints Peter, Felix, and Nabor, and the Lochner Altarpiece.  Nicolas of Verdun's Reliquary Shrine of the Three Magi stands in the choir; the Gero Cross, the earliest life-size crucifix, hangs outside the sacristy.  This building made headlines recently when it was the only UNESCO world heritage site in the developed world to be deemed endangered, and in 2007, Cardinal Joachim Meisner derided Gerhard Richter's window for this building as “degenerate.”  The building's  triangular black towers were finished in 1880, 632 years after the laying of the foundation stone, and it withstood bombing during World War II.  The tallest building in the world before the construction of the Washington Monument, FTP, name this German Gothic cathedral on the Rhine.

answer: {Gottlob Frege}

Michael Resnik's work on this philosopher suggests a “platonic taxonomy” to classify “abstract objects” that he formulated. Crispin Wright has popularized a school of thought named after this thinker, defending the so called Principle of Unrestricted Comprehension or this man's “Basic Law V.” One work by this man describes the derivation of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from Hume's Principle, which is a result now known as his namesake theorem. Another work discusses the differences between (*) “morning star” and “evening star” and attacks the notion that the equality operator is not inherently true when referring to two mathematical expressions that are equal. For 10 points, identify this 19th century logician who wrote The Foundations of Arithmetic and On Sense and Reference.

answer: {Floating} Point Numbers

One approximation for doing a certain mathematical operation developed while using this representation involves the hexadecimal magic constant 5f3759df and is used to calculate a “fast inverse square root” if the input is represented in this format. De-normalized numbers are used to resolve arithmetic underflows that occur when using this representation, while an exception named after this representation is often thrown when dividing by zero. The current standard regarding the implementation of these entities is the (*) IEEE 754-2008 standard, which specifies the amount of precision they have. In C++ they typically consume less space than the related double but store more information than a simple int. For 10 points, name this common way of representing numbers using significant digits and an exponent, which are not fixed point numbers.

answer: {Eight Immortals} or {Ba Xian} or {Pa}-{Hsien}

One of these figures ate powdered mica and promised to remain a virgin after a god appeared to her in a dream. Another of them once poured several cups of wine out of a container to demonstrate his power. One of these figures, given the epithet “old”, had a donkey that he could fold into his pocket. During another one's birth, beams of light filled the delivery room, and he didn't stop crying for seven days afterwards. Another of these figures occupied the body of a hobo after his student forgot to bury his original body; that figure is the patron of the poor and is depicted with an iron crutch. These figures lived on a set of five islands surrounded by still water, which they crossed by using clouds, and their leader once slept and saw eighteen years worth of dreams in the time it took his millet to cook. Lead by Lu Dongbin, they are revered alongside the three pure ones. For 10 points, name these Daoist deities, an octet of figures who cannot die.

answer: {Knuckleball} or {knuckler}

Willie Stargell notably described it as a “butterfly with hiccups”. Some of the first baseball players credited with using it include Ed Summers and Eddie Cicotte, while modern-day users of it include Houston Astro Josh Banks and New York Met R.A. Dickey. 18-year-old Eri Yoshida became the first woman to play professional baseball in Japan for her proficiency with this. In 2004, Doug Mirabelli occasionally replaced Jason Varitek in the line-up because of his ability to handle this, while Geno Petralli had a record four passed balls in one inning because of his battery mate's Charlie Hough's specialty with this. Hall of Famers Jesse Haines, Hoyt Wilhelm and Phil Niekro relied on this pitch which normally ranges in speeds between 60 and 70 miles per hour. Utilized most notably today by Tim Wakefield, FTP, name this characteristically wild pitch named for a part of a hand.
