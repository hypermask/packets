answer: {specific} heat {capacity} [or {specific} heat]

For an ideal gas, the dimensionless form of this quantity is the derivative of the entropy per particle with respect to the natural logarithm of temperature. In one model, this quantity is proportional to one over the hyperbolic sine squared of epsilon over 2kt, a formula derived by noting that it has 3N degrees of freedom. Plotting this quantity versus temperature for a superfluid around the lambda point gives a lambda shape. The aforementioned model derives this quantity by visualizing solids as a (*) lattice of harmonic oscillators. This quantity was given a T-cubed dependence in a model by Debye, which Einstein improved upon. For an ideal gas, the constant volume and constant pressure versions of this quantity differ by the number of moles times R. For 10 points, name this quantity, the amount of heat needed to change an object's temperature by one degree.
