answer: {Gravitational Lensing}

The OGLE, MOA , and PLANET experiments are based on the measurement of this effect, and the utility of data obtained using this effect is limited by the mass sheet degeneracy. Steitz and Schneider improved on a method used to recovering the mass distribution from data obtained from this effect, which is usually done using Kaiser-Squires inversion. The angle created by this effect is equal to four GM divided by RC squared. Walsh, Carswell and Weymann were the first to observe this effect in the Twin quasar. This effect can be used to find MACHOs and extrasolar planets; specifically, the micro- version of it. An object named for Huchra generates the Einstein cross via this effect, which is caused by the curvature of space. For 10 points, name this effect, in which light is bent by gravity.

The quadrupole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background imparts this property upon it, which can be divided into curl-free and a gradient-free component, known as the E mode and the B mode. The TRISTAN instrument observed this property in the vacuum, which leads to the creation of virtual electron-positron pairs. The electric displacement field is equal to the permittivity times the electric field plus this quantity. An object that imparts this quantity has a fractional transmission of intensity equal to the square of the cosine of its axis.
