answer: 1812 Overture

A classic recording of this piece of music was made by the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra in 1954 using the Mercury Living Presence one-microphone technique. That recording was conducted by Antal Dorati and used a traditional carillon instead of tubular bells. Commissioned for the consecration of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, it was popularized by a 1974 holiday performance by (*) Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops. This piece of music begins with quiet cellos and strings playing the hymn “God, Preserve thy People,” and pits two historically anachronistic national anthems against one another. The first of those anthems, the “Marseillaise,” is finally vanquished by “God Preserve the Czar” during this piece's climax, which includes cannon fire. For 10 points, name this piece depicting Napoleon's invasion of Russia in the title year, composed by Tchaikovsky.

answer: {Stability} (accept word forms)

A control system has this property if the number of poles of the closed-loop system in the right half plane is zero according to Nyquist's criterion. The neighborhood around a supercritical Hopf bifurcation produce limit cycles with this property, and limit cycles with this property have a negative first Lyapunov coefficient. A linearized dynamical system only has this property if the eigenvalues of the matrix have negative real parts. A collection of point charges cannot have a stationary equilibrium with this property according to Earnshaw's theorem. In the shell model, a nucleus has this property if all of its shells are filled, and nuclei that are doubly magic have an especially strong version of this property. Due to deformation of large nuclei, Seaborg predicted the existence of an “island” of nuclei with this property, which would not undergo radioactive decay. For 10 points, name this property of some systems which allows them to resist small perturbations.

answer: {Pablo Escobar}

One of this man's lovers testified that this figure financed an incident in which members of the 19th of April Movement besieged the Palace of Justice. Upon capture, this man was kept at a prison known as “The Cathedral”. He and Carlos Lehder constructed Norman's Cay as a waypoint for their operation, and this man is responsible for the Aviancia flight 203 bombing. He managed to evade the law by financing the construction of several Catholic Churches in his hometown. He put forward a “silver or lead” policy of dealing with the government, which essentially meant that they could either take bribes or get shot.

The first of the tertöns was one of these figures, for whom the honorific Rinpoche is reserved. Many of these figures agree that the highest of the nine yana teachings, the Dzogchen, is the most profound of all. These figures represent the “root of blessing” or grace and, along with the protector and yidam, comprise the Three Roots, which are the Inner form of the Three Jewels. Particularly high-ranking figures from this group are styled the Tulku and have the ability to choose the manner of their (*) reincarnation. These figures are the teachers in the Kagyu, Sakya, Gelug, and Nyingma traditions. The Chinese don't recognize the 21-year old Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the current second highest-ranking of them, the Panchen kind. The highest ranking of these figures has been in exile in India since 1959. For 10 points, identify these priests of Tibetan Buddhism, led by the “Dalai” variety.

answer: {Granite}

S-types of these rocks are produced from sediments high in SiO2s while I-types typically from crystal fracination with limited weathering in the Chappell-White classification scheme for these kinds of rocks. Isolated deposits of this rock embedded with gabbro are thought to be associated with the Cape Ann earthquake. An unusual version of this rock called “orbicular” is mostly found in Finland and weathering of this material by contact with water can produce kaolin. Enchanted Rock in Texas is formed from a pink form of this rock, which often occurs in plutons due to the high viscosity of the magma that forms this substance. Often formed at continental margins rather than mid-continental rifts, large, unbroken deposits of this type of intrusive rock are known as batholiths, such as the Sierra Nevada. For 10 points, identify this felsic mineral that often forms domes like Stone Mountain.

answer: {Zorba} the {Greek} [or {Life} and {Adventures} of {Alexis Zorbas}]

In this novel, a grandfather tells his son that it is a sin to prefer one dish to another because “there are people who are hungry.” This novel's narrator compares his “internal no” and “the void” with the Buddha, which he studies about just as the title character compares the Virgin Mary to the object of his affection. That woman spends the night with the narrator and causes a jealous suitor to drown himself in the ocean, leading to her own stoning. The title character often dances and plays his santuri, which he uses to entertain and persuade several monks into letting him use the (*) timber from their forest. The murder of the Widow occurs just before an aged hotel-owning harlot marries the title character, who had first met the narrator at a cafe in Piraeus and serves under him as an employee of a lignite mine in Crete.

answer: {Electron}-{electron} repulsion or {electron correlation} or {Columb}[{ic}] repulsion (accept anything that {implies} that {electrons repel} or {interact} with {each} other)

Configuration state parameters can be used to estimate it, and a decrease in this interaction upon ligand binding causes the nephelauxetic effect. A set of three parameters A, B, C which reflect this interaction are named for Racah, one of which  normalizes both axes of a Tanabe-Sugano diagram. This interaction is responsible for the difference between the actual energy of a system and the Hartree-Fock energy, which is why post-Hartree-Fock methods attempt to calculate it. The presence of a term for this interaction in the Schrodinger equation of a helium atom makes it non-separable, and this interaction breaks the degeneracy of orbitals with the same principal quantum number but different angular momentum quantum numbers. This interaction is the basis for Hund's rule, which states the particles involved fill up orbitals one at a time. For 10 points, name this repulsion between negative particles.

One work by this thinker discusses how the “possible powers” of an agent are not necessarily moral, and attempts to define potentialities in terms of the two concepts of “fixed” and “intrinsic” ends. In addition to “Time and Individuality,” this man posited that nature is a system of “possible starting points and opportunities rather than final ends” in another work. He responded to a Walter Lippmann book by positing that the populus cannot be transformed into the title entity until the fruits of (*) scientific knowledge can be easily disseminated.

Applying the Cobb-Douglass equation to this economic concept can be done to easily solve the Fisher Equilibrium problem by transforming it into an equivalent homogenous degree 1 log-concave function. Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern proposed four axioms such as completeness and transitivity that govern the rationality people exist that is necessary to account for while calculating this economic quantity. One way of graphically illustrating this quantity with respect to two resources was illustrated in Francis Edgeworth's Mathematical Psychics, and involves plotting various combinations of various quantities of two (*) resources for two party's consumption. Indifference curves are graphic representations depicting various quantities of goods that, for a particular consumer, will keep this quantity constant. For 10 points, name this economic measure of satisfaction.

answer: {Nitric Oxide} or NO

DAF-2 diacetate can be used to visualize this molecule, whose synthesis is inhibited by NPA. The enzyme that synthesizes this molecule contains both a heme and a tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor, and its two domains are brought together in a calmodulin-dependent manner. That enzyme comes in an inducible form, a neuronal form with an extra PDZ domain that anchors to dystrophin, and an endothelial isoform. This molecule's release is triggered by shear stress upon endothelial cells and is synthesized from L-arginine. This molecule activates the soluble isoform of guanylyl cyclase, leading to increased cyclic GMP the relaxation of smooth muscle cells. Viagra increases the levels of this molecule, which is one of the few gaseous, small signaling molecules.

answer: {pleading} no {contest} [or {nolo contendere}; {take} Alford {plea} before {North Carolina}]

The court case Oregon State Penitentiary v Tamayo Reyes allowed an evidentiary to determine the mens rea of the defendant who had performed this action. A similar way of doing this action was the subject of an appeal the defendant made in the case State v. Hansen; that similar way of doing this action was first invoked by the defendant in North Carolina v. Alford, a practice now named for him. Most law codes in the U.S. state that this action is only an admission of (*) guilt for sentencing purposes; it has no effect on the evidentiary status that stem from civil lawsuits. It's not staying silent, but this response is the third option one can say while being  arraigned. For 10 points, name this alternative to saying “guilty” or “not guilty,” which usually means a defendant accepts the charges before him.
