answer: {Virial} theorem

Peebles derived a cosmic version of this theorem in order to find the peculiar velocity profiles of groups of galaxies, and that theorem uses two- and three-point mass correlation functions. A variational form of this theorem can be used to find the frequency of stable radial pulsations of a ball of gas. n one famous application of this theorem, the Coma galaxy cluster was found to be 160 times more massive than its luminosity would suggest, leading Zwicky to hypothesize the existence of dark matter. This equation is derived by showing that one half of the time derivative of the moment of inertia of a group of particles is equal to the sum over the dot product of each particles' position vector and momentum vector.. For 10 points, name this theorem, which states that for a self-gravitating system, the average kinetic energy is equal to negative one half times the average potential energy.

These people may have played a funerary game called Phersu, where an irritated wild dog attacked a tied-up man. This civilization created the Sarcophagus of the Spouses, which depicted a husband and wife reclining at a banquet table. An important architect of this people was Vulca and its religion was allegedly founded by Tages. One female from this civilization prophesied that her husband would become king after seeing an eagle snatch a hat from his head. The naval hegemony of this polity was limited after the Battle of Alalia and they suffered a major defeat at the hands of Hiero at the Battle of Cumae. One leader of this people, Lars Porsenna, tried and failed to conquer this civilization's greatest rival, whose domination over these people began with the sack of Veii by Camillus. Tanaquil and Tarquin the Proud were, for ten points, leaders of what civilization, which worshipped Charun and Tinia.

This novel was expanded from a short story linking the disappearance of cats to the actions of a mysterious Redwood. Contradictory references to the “Five and a Half Minute Hallway” abound in this novel, which is the companion to its author's novella The (*) Whalestoe Letters. A fictional study of a documentary, the Navidson Record, is written by the blind Zampanò, who is studied by the parlor employee Johnny Truant. This novel's cover is smaller than the pages and plenty of codes and a confusing index are present in most editions. For 10 points, identify this academic satire, the magnum opus of Mark Z.

answer: {Joseph Nye}

In an article explaining his soon to be released next book, this author imagined a three-dimensional chess game, whose bottom dimension consists of widely diffused gameplay, claiming “it makes no sense to speak of unipolarity, multipolarity, and hegemony.” Another work makes a distinction between two types of “most likely resources”, such as bribes and payments as opposed to culture and institutions in defining the titular resource. With Robert Keohane, he launched the (*) neoliberal school of interpretation in their book Power and Interdependence. Subsequent works, like The Paradox of American Power, elaborate on his distinction between an agent's ability to coerce other parties for an end and the ability to convince other parties to cooperate for the same end.

answer: {Urea}

Dehydration of this compound creates carbodiimides. A solution of this substance and lithium chloride can be used to extract RNA from cells, and it that solution it is present in excess of 8 molar. This substance was the denaturing agent in the experiment that showed that the three-dimensional structure of a protein is encoded by its one-dimensional structure, performed on ribonuclease by Anfinsen. The BUN measures the amount of this substance in the blood, where it is the primary ineffective solute. It is created by a pathway regulated by the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthase, and in that pathway it is created from the transformation of arginine to ornithine. That namesake cycle occurs in the liver, where it transforms the ammonia from protein catabolism. For 10 points, name this compound, the primary form of nitrogenous waste secreted by humans.

answer: {Primogeniture} [accept before {hand} first {born children gets everything}, {everyone else gets screwed}]

According to James Fraser's Foklore in the Old Testament, the Hebrews started this practice once they “exchanged their nomadic life of herdsman” with that of the “settled life of peasants,” leading him to conclude Jakob did no wrong to Esau. In a discussion about this practice in relation to Political Freedom, de Tocqueville's Democracy in America argues that this practice is incompatible with its free acquisition, and it also sacrifices the “interests of the widow.” This practice stands in direct opposition to the (*) proximity of blood approach. The law of entail was an English law forcing  men to follow this practice, and that law was abolished the Property Act. In Salic Law, females were excluded from the methods behind the agnatic form of this practice. For 10 points, name this simple practice of distributing a family's own property to the first born child, as distinguished from ultimogeniture.

The Dedekind example of this is commutative and is equivalent to a set of algebraic integers in its field of fractions. Schur's lemma states that a specific type of these for an irreducible module is a division algebra. Another example of this structure follows the equivalent statements that certain subsets of it each contain a maximal element and follow the ascending chain condition. That type is termed Noetherian. Commutative examples of this structure with no zero divisors are termed integral domains. All modules are defined over this structure, and subsets of this structure that form abelian groups under addition and absorb products are termed ideals. For 10 points, name this algebraic structure consisting of a set with two operations, usually addition and multiplication, where the set forms an additive abelian group.

The receptor for this molecule is complexed with the CTR1 protein in the ER of responsive cells, and that receptor's c-terminus is homologous to bacterial two-component systems and contains a histidine kinase domain. A rise in this molecule corresponds with the climacteric stage of a certain process. The synthesis of this molecule relies on MTA nucleosidase and an enzyme that synthesizes a cyclopropane derivative called ACC, which is cleaved from S-adenosyl methionine in the Yang cycle. Ein3 mutants are insensitive to this hormone. This molecule is responsible for causing the thickening, shortening and hooking of the hypocotyl in response to a barrier, known as the triple response. This hormone is responsible for leaf abscission and fruit ripening, and is the cause of one bad apple spoiling the bunch. For 10 points, name this gaseous plant hormone.
