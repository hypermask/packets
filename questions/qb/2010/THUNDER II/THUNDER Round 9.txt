answer: {Epoxides} or {oxiranes} (prompt on {ethers})

A hydroxyl version of this functional group is isomerized in the Payne rearrangement, and aflatoxin damages DNA after one of these moieties is added to it by the P450 system. One method of synthesizing them uses a catalyst with a manganese-III salen-like ligand dissolved with sodium hypochlorite, while another uses DET and titanium isopropoxide. A third method reacts a carbonyl with a sulfonium ylide. They can be opened with a Grignard reagent in an SN2-like reaction or protonated with sulfuric acid and then opened in an SN1-like reaction. Besides the Jacobsen, Sharpless, and Corey-Chaykovsky reactions, this functional group can be created from halohydrins in an intermolecular Williamson synthesis. They have lots of ring strain due to the sixty-degree angle of their bonds. For 10 points, name this functional group, a three-member ring with two carbons and one oxygen.

answer: John {Searle}

One of this man's works uses the example of the decline of the requirements for knighthood to show how the deontic powers associated with status functions derived from institutional facts has decayed. In addition to his most recent work The Construction of Social Reality, this philosopher criticized a different thinker for his interpretation of Austin's term the “parasitic” and his own conception of “iterability.” That essay by this thinker, called “Reiterating the Differences” was the subject of Jacques Derrida's Limited Inc. Another argument by this man, relies on three (*) axioms, two of which are “minds have mental contents” and “syntax by itself is neither constitutive nor sufficient for semantics.” That argument against strong AI is best illustrated by a man who feeds in strips of text to a man with a dictionary in another room.

answer: US {Invasion} of {Grenada} (or Operation Urgent Fury before mention)

General Assembly Resolution 38/7 opposed this event, which Ronald H Cole published a report about after its occurrence. A report by Ron Dellums about the construction of an airport preceded  this event. The proximal cause of this event was the murder of Maurice Bishop, and inefficencies during this military action resulted in the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols act. Public support for this event was partially drudged up by the fact that there was a group of medical students in the target nation. It resulted in the deposition of Hudson Austin, and this action was staunchly opposed by Margaret Thatcher due to the target nation's status as a member of the British Commonwealth.

answer: {Fundamental Attribution Error}

A two stage model for this phenomenon by Daniel Gilbert divides the central process into a “spontaneous dispositional” phase and a “deliberative” phase. The person who first described this phenomenon performed an experiment asking college students to wear a sandwich board advertising “Eat at Joe's” to discover the closely related false consensus effect. The original experiment that led this phenomenon to be so-named saw general knowledge questions made by question-askers rate their own knowledge against that of the contestant. Coined by (*) Lee Ross, the Jones and Harris experiment elucidating this phenomenon had observers read pro-Castro and anti-Castro essays. For 10 points, name this cognitive bias of assigning shortfalls of human beings to their behavior.

answer: {Neutron} Stars

A pair of equations governing these objects has a solution named for Buchdahl. Latimer showed that the equation of state for one form of these objects is soft at low density and stiff at high density. These objects exhibition a phase transition from a spaghetti phase to a Swiss cheese phase when moving towards the core. Gamow and Scheonberg postulated a mechanism by which these stars would emit a neutrino to cool, known as the Urca process. These objects are postulated to have an outer core that consists of a Fermi liquid, while their core composition is unknown. The fact that their crusts are very stiff means that when these objects slow their rotation, the crust quickly adjusts in a starquake. The upper limit of these object's mass is postulated to be between 1.5 to 2 solar masses, a value known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit. They form when the core of a star collapses during a supernova. For 10 points, name these dense stars made of a namesake neutral particle

answer: {Spin}-{orbit} coupling or {spin}-{orbit} interaction

The X-ray photoelectron spectrum of palladium has two peaks due to this effect. This effect was documented in a Jahn-Teller lattice by Kugel and Khomskii, and increasing the strength of this phenomenon allows intersystem crossing. Two-dimensional semiconductors with high values of this interaction give rise to the quantum spin Hall effect. The Lande interval rule states that if this interaction is weak, the components of this interaction have split energy levels. Its interaction energy is equal to the sum of the energy of Thomas precession and the Larmor energy, and this effect creates a 2J+1 degeneracy. It can be considered an internal version of the Zeeman effect, and can be divided into JJ and Russell-Saunders coupling depending on the size of the atom involved. For 10 points, name this interaction, a coupling between the magnetic field of a nucleus and the spin of an electron circling it.

The SaeRS two-component system regulates the expression of virulence factors in this organism, and the commonly-used immunoglobulin-binding protein Protein A was isolated from this organism. Particular subsets of this organism contain the mec cassette and the vanA gene, which confer resistance to certain antibiotics. This organism, which is catalase positive, coagulate positive, and beta-hemolytic, secretes the TSST-1 superantigen responsible for toxic shock syndrome. Also the cause of acute endocarditis and impetigo, a subspecies of this bacterium is resistant to methicillin and is rampant in hospitals.

An unknown Corinthian sculptor created a depiction of one of these found near the cenotaph of Menocrates. They're not eagles, but a bridge in Sofia, Bulgaria is named for the fact that two sculptures of them are found on either side of each entrance. The Borobadour complex contains thirty-two depictions of these creatures next to arched gateways, and a monument at Sarnath contained four of them facing away from each other.  A sculpture commemorating the Swiss Guards killed during the French revolution was created by Bertel Thorvaldssen in the shape of one of these animals; that example is found in (*) Lucerne.  Both Falconet and Pierre Puget sculpted a scene in which one of these creatures attacks a wrestler named Milo of Croton. Edwin Landseer created four bronze ones for Nelson's column. For 10 points, name these animals, whose skin Heracles is often depicted wearing.
