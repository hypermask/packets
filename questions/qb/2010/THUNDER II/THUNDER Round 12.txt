answer: {oceanic currents} or {oceanic circulations} [do not accept “The {Oceanic Feeling}”]

These entities are modeled three-dimensionally by a process that divides them into a series of boxes, providing plentiful boundary conditions to simulate mixing layers. That model is known as the MOM project. One relationship for the magnitude of these entities is proportional to the curl of the wind stress vector and is named for Sverdrup. When the direction of one of these entities is balanced against a pressure gradient by the Coriolis force,it is described as geostrophic. Another of these entities is driven by variations in solute concentration and surfaceheat and that ‘thermohaline' variety is the cause of massive convection circuits through upwelling and downwelling.A subsurface variety of these entities occurs when sediment buildup causes an increase in density and is named forits ‘turbidity'. FTP, identify these continuous fluid flows found in the Earth's largest bodies of water.

answer: {Chlorine} (Accept {Cl2} or {chlorine gas} at any {time})

The Miller process of gold purification involves blowing this substance into the impure mixture, and a radioactive isotope of this element can be generated by muon capture in calcium-40. In mass spectrometry of compounds containing this element, an M plus 2 compound peak of one-half the intensity of the M peak is obtained.  The Deacon oxidation process is one method of producing this element, which is produced on a large scale by performing electrolysis on brine, which also produces caustic soda and hydrogen gas. This element is incorporated into organic compounds by a reagent which contains five atoms of it bonded to a single phosphorous atom, and mixing acids and bleach can release the gaseous form of this compound, which was the first chemical weapon used. For 10 points, name this element with atomic mass 35.45, atomic number 17, and symbol Cl.

The AMPTE experiment  used lithium clouds to study the impact of this  phenomenon. Biermann and Ahnert both used the example of Whipple-Fedke to predict this phenomenon. IBEX has detected an unusual “ribbon” involving this phenomenon thought to be interacting with the “Local Fluff”. It uses the Lorenz Force to help produce ring and Birkeland currents. Yokoh discovered that x-ray “holes” were a major source of this phenomenon, which notably affects the structure of Parker Spirals. M-dot and terminal velocity are two parameters derived to help measure this phenomenon, which dies out when it reaches the heliosheath. The Mass Loss Rate for the closest example of this phenomenon is 10 to the negative 14 per year.

This material can be used industrially to purify water because of its ability to bond with both organic PCBs and heavy metals often found in waste water. This material consists of repeated N-acetyl-glucosamine residues linked together by beta-1-4 glycosidic bonds, although those bonds can be hydrolyzed by lysozyme, which protects mammals from infection.  Although in its natural state this material is soft and leathery, when it mixes with sclerotin, it becomes encrusted with calcium carbonate. It is believed to have made up the bodies of trilobites as early as the Pre-Cambrian Era. 10 points, name this hard protein that makes up the cell wall of fungi and the exoskeleton of insects and arachnids.
