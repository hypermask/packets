One character in this opera is dispatched to obtain three ships, but never has any singing roles. Isèpo disguises himself as a fisherman along with a character, who sings about writing an anonymous letter in the aria “O monumento” to be deposited in a structure whose title makes up the first act. That act opens with the title character of this opera leading her blind mother La Cieca around and is titled “The Lion's Mouth.” The sight of a mother's rosary hanging around a neck in this opera leads the title character to reconsider murdering (*) Laura, whose husband Alvise Badoero is a leader of the Inquisition. “Cielo e mar” is sung by Enzo in this opera, whose libretto is by Arrigo Boito and whose most famous number, occuring in Act III, scene 2, is a ballet that signifies the passage of time. For 10 points, identify this opera which contains the “Dance of the Hours,” written by Amilcare Ponchielli.

answer: {DNA repair} pathways (equivalents {ok}, {more specific} answers like mismatch {repair}, base excision {repair}, nucleotide excision {repair}, and {non}-{homologous} end {joining} are {just fine})

Defects in pathways that perform this action lead to ataxia telangactasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome, and mutations in ERCC8 and ERCC6, which are involved in the transcription-coupled pathway of this, cause Cocakyne syndrome. Defects in one pathway that performs this action cause HNPCC or Lynch syndrome and lead to microsatellite instability; that pathway uses the MutL-MutS complex to recruit MutH and is dependent upon hemimethylation. One pathway that performs this action is defective in patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum, who are unable to remove a certain dimer created by UV light. If pathways that perform this process fail, Ku proteins and other sensors can trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, mainly through p53. For 10 points, name this process, which comes in mismatch, nucleotide excision, and base excision types, all of which reverse damage done to the genome.

answer: {Light} in {August}

The first chapter of this novel ends with one character's purchase of a fifteen-cent can of sardines and observation of two large plumes of smoke in the distance. Chronologically earlier than that, another character is so disgusted by the menstrual cycle that he slaughters a farmer's sheep. A third character is so caught up in the mystery of his chicken-stealing Cavalryman grandfather that he does not care about his adulterous wife, who had committed suicide by jumping from a hotel window. A sexual misstep by the dietitian Miss Atkins leads to the ejection of the protagonist from his orphanage. Thus begins the protagonist's string of misfortunes, which include his murder of foster father (*) Mr. McEachern, castration in the farm of Gail Hightower, and murder of Joanna Burden. Lena Grove searches for the father of her child in, for 10 points, what novel about Joe Christmas, written by William Faulkner?

answer: Battle of {Marathon}

A campaign two years prior to this battle saw one the combatants force the capitulation of Alexander I of Macedon and conquer Thrace. This battle was immediately preceded by the sack of Naxos and the siege of Eritrea. A famous anecdote about this battle tells of how Cynaegirus tried to bring one of the loser's ships back to shore by latching onto its prow. The winning side attempted to delay this battle since their allies were in the middle of a ten day festival called the Carneia. Though the polemarch, Callimachus commanded the right wing on the winning side and the forces of Datis and Artaphernes were pushed back to their ships by a charge led by another strategos, Militiades. Phidippides was sent on a 26 mile run to report an Atheinan victory at, for ten points, what 490 BC battle that brought Darius' invasion of Greece to an end.

answer: {Greek}

A landmark study by Humbert has traced the non-usage of the dative case in this language during the medieval era, that medieval form of this language was used to inscribe a column found in Chatalar. The ancient form of this language confined the “free” word accent to its last syllable. The Balkan Sprachbund during the late Dark Ages mainly used Albanian and this other language. Pronouncing this language during that time period is illustrated by the Suda. When a word begins with a vowel in this language, you either form a (*) spiritus lenis or a spiritus asper to pronounce that word. For forming superlative adjectives in this language, appending “tatos” to adjectives will do just fine. For 10 points, identify this language, whose medieval version is called Byzantine, and whose ancient version was used by Pindar and Sapphro.

answer: {Hilbert's Third} Problem (accept anything {involving cutting up} a {polyhedron} and {reassembling} it {into another} one)

The person who solved this problem went on to propose an algorithm to solve the word problem for groups, and also showed that if an ordered pair on a plane is selected from the hyperreal numbers, the parallel postulate doesn't hold. Dupont and Sah used the central relation of this problem to derive a few results in K-theory,  and algebraic K-theory was partly developed due to this problem's solution. The solution of this problem relied on the lemma that if the cosine of alpha is equal to one-third, then alpha divided by pi is irrational. Sydler's theorem gives cases in which the answer to this problem is “yes”, and the Bolyai-Gerwin theorem  solves the equivalent problem in two dimensions. An important quantity used to solve this problem is an element of the tensor product of R with the quotient space R divided by Q pi. That quantity is the Dehn invariant, which is equal for two figures if and only if they are scissors-congruent and have the same volume.  For 10 points, name this problem, which asks whether a polyhedron can be cut up and reassembled into any other polyhedron of equal volume.

answer: {Nucleophiles} (accept {Lewis acids} before mention, accept {nucleophilicity} or other word forms)

Jencks and Carriulo discovered that lone pair donation bolsters this property in the alpha effect, and one scale used to measure the strength of these compounds sets the log of k equal to the quantity N plus E times a namesake slope parameter. That equation, named for Mayr and Patz, succeeded the Ritchie and Swain-Scott equations. When a compound with this property attacks an arene with electron-withdrawing groups, a Meisenheimer complex is created, and solvolysis occurs when the solvent acts as one of these. More famously, one of these compounds triggers a Walden inversion when it attacks the backside of a carbon with a good leaving group. Functionally equivalent to Lewis acids due to their electron-donating nature, for 10 points, name these compounds that are part of namesake unimolecular and bimolecular substitutions, the opposite of electrophiles.

answer: {Hysteresis}

One model of this phenomenon was modified by Baber by adding degradation functions, and that model states that this phenomenon becomes “pinched” near the middle of a member. Another model of it relies on summing over a series of discrete elements, each with a switch-off and switch-on threshold. In elastic systems, this phenomenon manifests itself as a need for more force for a given amount of distension during a loading phase than an unloading phase. Those aforementioned models are the Bouc-Wen and Preisach models, and a more famous example of this phenomenon has an offset value known as the remnance and occurs in ferromagnetic systems, where the graph of magnetic field strength versus magnetization forms a loop. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which a lag in a material occurs between the application and removal of an external force or field.
