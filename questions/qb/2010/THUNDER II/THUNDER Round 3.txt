answer: {Khmer} Rouge

One facility run by this government was converted from a high school and had a name meaning Strychnine Hill. This government designated persons from urban areas “New People” and rural persons “Old People”. This government's credo of self-reliance at all costs led to it withholding malaria medication from the populace, and this government abolished the use of complex honorifics to refer to societal status. Its leader was referred to as Brother Number 1. This regime killed Chams, (*) Christians, professionals, and people wearing glasses, who were forced to dig their own graves; those events were brought to light by Dith Pran. An invasion by Vietnam ended its rule, and this organization ousted Norodom Sihanouk after using him as a puppet ruler. For 10 points, name this government responsible for the Killing Fields, a Pol Pot-led communist group that ruled Cambodia.

answer: {Course} in {General Linguistics} [or {Cours} de {linguistique générale}]

One chapter of this work contains an illustration of the cutting away of a cross-section of a plant to illustrate how studying the titular discipline in a point in time is dealing with “a system of values with modifications to it.”That idea is used to argue  that the titular discipline can be studied with respect to evolutionary processes called diachrony and with respect to “states,”called synchrony. This work cites “popular etymology” as one way that those states may evolve, but is only possible to do so through verbal use of words. This work claims that auditory forms of communication are inherently “linear” or (*) “syntagmatic” and that since writing can be “multi- dimensional,” it is associative. This set of lecture notes begins by making a distinction between the parole and langue. Arguing that the basic unit of linguistic meaning is a “sign” which can be broken into a signified and signifier component, for 10 points, name this work of Ferdinand de Saussure.

The protein mutated in Friedrich's Ataxia, frataxin, localizes to this organelle. This organelle is stained by a series of rosamine derivatives sold by Invitrogen, named [this organelle]-“tracker”. Antibodies to proteins within it are present in 95% of primary billiary cirrhosis cases. Another dye that localizes here is nonyl acridine orange, which stains a bicyclic phospholipid called cardiolipin. The glycerol phosphate and malate-aspartate shuttles move reducing equivalents into it, and with the aid of the (*) carnitine shuttle it carries out beta-oxidation.  MELAS and ragged red fiber disease are caused by defects in it, as is Leber's Neuropathy.

answer: {Meditations} on First Philosophy

In his Philosophy Interpreted According to the Order of Reasons, Martial Gueroult interpreted this text as a diptych whose right panel depicts a point of light fighting against the “principle of universal deception.” Near the end of this work's fifth part, the author claims that while looking at a proof of a triangle that all of its three sides sum to two right angles, he has a hard time believing it is true, but while not looking at the proof, he can summarily think that it is true. Another portion contemplates why (*) God can exist if there is room for “error,” which this work attributes to a conflation between the cognition and free will. The author tries to define what a piece of wax is by defining its properties in another part. This work begins by supposing that all sense-data around him may be corrupt because the author might be deceived by an evil demon. For 10 points, identify this set of six works by Rene Descartes.

answer: {Prospect} theory

This method rejects the Ramsey-Savage approach of calculating weights, and proposes its own weighting function. This concept was introduced in a paper that improved Maurice Allais's work, by posing a set of scenarios in which people had a chance of winning week long excursions to England. This idea accounts for the phenomenon that between a number of alternatives, it is their differences that are analyzed, not their shared characteristics, which is dubbed the (*) isolation effect. One of the central tenets of this idea is an analysis of the value function's concavity, illustrating that a reduction of one percent from a 100% probability of a desirable outcome induces more risk aversion as opposed to a one percent reduction from a 10% probability. For 10 points, name this model of risk aversion accounts for more than just expected utility, introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahnemann.

answer: {eigenvalues}

One class of algorithms for finding these numbers constructs Krylov subspace in order to cut down on the number of iterations necessary; those algorithms include Arnold's method and the Lanczos iteration. In vibrational analysis, for a system with N degrees of freedom, these numbers are the natural frequencies of the system. Another popular method for finding them is based on finding the QR decomposition and putting the argument into Hessenberg Form. These entities algebraic multiplicity is greater than their geometric multiplicy, and for infinite-dimensional spaces, these numbers are easily found using the (*) spectral decomposition. They are the roots of the characteristic polynomial. When multiplying a matrix by one of their corresponding vectors, the result is one of these times that vector. For 10 points, name these values symbolized lambda, important in the theory of linear transformations.

answer: {Thiamine} [accept {Thiamine pyrophosphate}; or {TPP}; accept {Vitamin B1} before mention]

A derivative of this molecule is sensed by the only riboswitch found in higher eukaryotes, and its binding to that riboswitch creates an unstable splice variant. The complex mutated in Maple Syrup Urine Disease relies on this molecule as a cofactor. In E. Coli its synthesis depends on IscS and the products of an operon with C, E, F, S, G, and H genes, which separately synthesize its hydroxymethylpyrimidine moiety with its thiazole moiety. The ylid form of that thiazole cleaves a carbon-carbon bond on substrates. Transketolase uses this compound as a cofactor, and its also used in an enzyme with E1, E2, and E3 subunits that also uses a (*) lipoic acid tether, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Deficiency of this compound comes in two forms; a wet form in which capillaries lose integrity, and a dry form which causes neuritis. That disease is beriberi.
