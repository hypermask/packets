answer: {Crohn's} Disease

One suspected causative agent of this disease is Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, which causes a similar disease in livestock. The autophagy-controlling gene ATG16L1 is linked to this disease. This disease is strongly linked to mutations in a protein that recognizes muramyl dipeptide moieties and contains two caspase recruitment domains, known as NOD2. The TNF-alpha inhibitor infliximab was originally approved to treat it, and it is associated with a Th17 response. Its complications include a seronegative spondylarthropathies, fissures, and fistulae. Unlike ulcerative colitis this disease shows discontinuous, or “skip” lesions, which are usually seen on colonoscopy. Caused by an inflammation of the GI tract, most often the small intestine, for 10 points, name this disease characterized by bloody diarrhea and weight loss, named for an American.

One of this man's works describes how prejudices can influence our ability to make judgements in a short period of time, an ability he terms “thin-slicing”.  One of this man's works claims that success in a field is basically dependent on spending ten thousand hours practicing any one thing; that work discusses Bill Gates and J. Robert Oppenheimer and others with high intelligence and is called (*) Outliers. He also used the metaphor of salesmen, mavens, and connectors to describe “The Power of the Few” in a book which discusses the tendency of events to change very rapidly after reaching a critical point.

answer: {Superego} [or the {Over}-{I}]

O. Harbart Mowrer's theory of guilt rejects the notion that this entity's state of confliction is its source, rather attributing guilt to misdeeds. According to Anna Freud, this idea is what becomes the domination factor in one's development in adolescence, helping to fill a “strong inner loss.” Joseph and Marie Sandler formulated this concept around the grammatical imperative mood, claiming it represents the “shoulds and should nots.” The man who formulated this concept claimed it followed a type of “ideal,” and that it was governed by “self-observation,” the “censorship of (*) dreams” and “the chief influence of repression.” As illustrated in its formulator's Totem and Taboo, it arises shortly after the phallic stage, where this concept is derived from the “father-complex.” For 10 points, name this Freudian portion of one's own unconscious that is developed based on morality, which often makes it diametrically opposed to the  id.

Bach composed a piece for organ known today as his toccata, this tempo marking, and fugue in C major.

This work criticizes American policy for not putting a cap on what percentage of an American household's income is being used to pay off debts by illustrating how American presidential candidates would always choose a policy that does not increase economic growth in its chapter “The Bill Collector Cometh.” This work argues that the “monetary illusion” is that monetary policies go beyond impacting the “wage-price spiral,” arguing that although it may prevent short-run inflation, it does nothing to stop it. Another chapter of this work discusses how in consumers, emulation and advertising are the basis for the (*) “dependence effect,” the phenomenon that, as production rises, so does increase in desires.

Izumi made this material enantioselective by adding optically active amino- or hydroxyl-acids, and this platinum- and rhodium-free compound can be used to cheaply transform benzene to cyclohexane on an industrial scale. The formation of sodium aluminate and precipitation of bayerite during synthesis of this material decreases its utility, and selective leaching is used to remove atoms from some phases of this material.  A common method of removing carbonyls is to transform them into thioacetals and then apply this material, which results in the corresponding alkane. This material is commonly used in desulfurization reactions and it is created by reacting a certain alloy with sodium hydroxide, leaving behind a porous catalyst with very high surface area. For 10 points, name this hydrogenation catalyst made of aluminum and a namesake metal, named for an American chemist.

One parameter that describes this phenomenon will be measured in the T2K experiment, and an anomalous result at the LSND about this phenomenon was refuted by the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab. The original experiment that detected this phenomenon bubbled helium gas through a tank every few days in order to collect samples of radioactive Argon from a giant take of perchloroethylene; that experiment was performed by Davis in the Homestake Mine and confirmed in the Sudbury Observatory. In matter, this phenomenon occurs due to electrons scattering the subject particles, known as the MSW effect, and this phenomenon is described by a set of three mixing angles in the Maki-Nagakawa-Sagata matrix. This phenomenon was originally postulated because detectors showed that the sun produced only one-third the predicted amount of a certain particle. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which the namesake particles created by annihilation cycle between three flavor states.

answer: {Irreducible} (word forms {ok})

An n-dimensional manifold has this property if any embedded sphere of dimension n minus 1 bounds a ball of dimension n. Any representation of a finite Lie algebra can be decomposed into a direct sum of representations with this property. A topological space has this property if and only if its not the union of two proper subsets, and one way of showing that a ring has this property is to show that its prime spectrum has it. A method of testing whether polynomials have this property relies on showing that there exists a prime p that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and that the constant term isn't divided by the square of that prime; that is known as Eisenstein's criterion. The fundamental theorem of algebra says that all polynomials with order less than two have this property over the complex numbers. For 10 points, name this property, which for a fraction occurs when the numerator and denominator has no common factors.

This philosopher wrote a work discussing the origins of certain types of impulses by discussing the circumstances of creation Tartini's “The Devil's Sonata” in his work Dreams. He claimed that humanity's curse is that it is the only racecapable of “knowing about life” but the only one incapable of attaining life's essence in his The Introduction to Metaphysics. Another work by this thinker addresses the “ideal genesis of matter,” contending that when the “block in the divine essence” prejudice is eradicated, the title process becomes clear. He claimed that the Platonic Forms are only snapshots of the “changing reality,” in a work that argues (*) science is a “mechanics of transformation.” That book discusses “duration” concept and posits an impetus which allows for the titular transformation to occur. For 10 points, name this Nobel Prize winning philosopher who put forth the idea of elan vital in his Creative Evolution.
