answer: {deuterium} [accept {deuteron} or {2H} but not “{H2}”; do not accept “{hydrogen}”]

Experiments involving reverberating isentropic shock to compress this liquid up to 330 gigapacals provide evidence for a related compound's fusion to form the metallic core of Jupiter and Saturn. Its oxide is used to enhance boron neutron capture theory because it slows incoming neutrons without interacting with them. That oxide is also typically used as a solvent in IR of proteins. This chemical combines with hydrogen in the second step of the proton-proton chain to yield a helium atom. Along with its elemental counterpart, this isotope is typically used in measuring the kinetic isotope effect, and it replaces a lighter atom in chloroform in a common solvent for NMR spec. Urey's observation of three faint spectral lines in the Balmer series served as initial evidence for this isotope's existence. For 10 points, name this isotope consisting of a proton, a neutron, and an electron, also called heavy hydrogen.

answer: {Judgement} of {Paris} (equivalents, they're {ok})

A painting attributed to Hans Eworth depicts Elizabeth I in a version of this scene. Charles Bell's photorealistic version of it shows some of the figures in translucent clothing wearing sashes and holding a key and a rose. Another version has the central figure in medieval armor sitting a against a tree in the center, while a red-winged figure emerges out of a dark cloud holding a bow. That depiction is by Cranach the Elder, and many depictions of this scene show a peacock standing behind one of the subjects. Another version has Alecto in a cloud clutching her head above the scene while a man with a winged hat hides behind a tree on the right, and depicts the figures on the left in various states of undress, the central one wrapping a red cloth around her backside. One of those nude figures is believed to be Helene Fourment, who looks at a golden apple held by the central male. For 10 points, name this scene depicted twice by Rubens, in which a Trojan decides which of three goddesses is the most attractive.

answer: {Polymers} (accept {chain} before mention)

In statistical mechanics, these objects can be modeled as a self-avoiding random walk. The end-to-end vector of one of these objects has a Gaussian distribution, which shows that the most common value of that vector is zero. One model describing them is derived by considering a lattice in which either one of their substituents or a solution molecule occupies each cell. The correlation function for one of these exponentially decays, with an exponent equal to negative s divided by the persistence length. The freely-jointed rod and the worm-like chain can be used to model them, and solutions of them are modeled by the Flory-Huggins theory. Chain-growth and step-growth mechanisms are used to synthesize them, and tacticity describes the orientation of their substituents. Ziegler-Natta catalysts can create, for 10 points, these compounds like neoprene, nylon, and rubber, which consist of repeating monomer units.

answer: {Herculaneum}

One skeleton found at this place was that of a soldier who had every bone in his body fractured but his inner ear. Karl Weber excavated a house at this archaeological site, finding a bronze replica of Polykleitos's Doryphoros, a library, and a small scale replica of Athena Promachos on a tablinium. Also where the so-called “ring lady” was found, modern excavation of this cite began when a scholar was sponsored by the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies to do so. That man, Rocque Joaquin, did the necessary work for future scholars to find the House of the Genius and the House of (*) Aristides. The largest private residence at this site contained frescoes of this city's namesake figure, was owned by Lucius Calpurnius Piso and was called the Villa of the Papyri. For 10 points, identify this place destroyed alongside Pompei and Stabiae when Vesuvius went boom, named for a mythological hero.

answer: The Seagull [or {Chayka}]

One character in this play justifies a love affair by reminding the audience that in his youth, he was preoccupied by making a name for himself rather than finding love. The lover of that character hands him a medallion with the line “if you ever need my life, come take it” from his book Days and Nights. One character compares his mother's relationship with her lover to Gertrude's with Claudius; for that insolence, he gets run off stage when two red eyes and the smoke of sulphur are released during a performance. The sound of that character's suicide is compared to the pop of a cork by the (*) doctor Dorn, who is attracted to Paulina. In this play, Medvedenko finally gets to marry Masha, who is still deeply in love with a successful writer who kills the title animal for Nina. When he realizes that Nina still loves Trigorin, Konstantin Treplev commits suicide. For 10 points, identify this play by Anton Chekov.

answer: preludes

Francois Couperin included an allemande and eight of these pieces to explain correct fingering in his book The Art of Playing the Harpsichord. Out of homage to that composer, the first movement of Le Tombeau de Couperin is one of these pieces. When prefaced by the word “chorale,” this is the name of the forty-six pieces in J.S. Bach's Little Organ Book. Rachmaninoff used one of these pieces nicknamed “chord” as the theme for his Variations on a Theme of (*) Chopin. The Opus 28 of Chopin consists of twenty-four of these piano pieces, including one nicknamed “Raindrop.” The Well-Tempered Clavier begins with one of these pieces in C major, and pairs them with fugues. For 10 points, identify these short pieces named because they originally served as introductions to longer works.

answer: {Cilia} (do not accept {Flagella}, accept {basal body due} to {ambiguities})

The recessive form of polycystic kidney disease is caused by mutations in proteins that localize to these structures, and their ultrastructure is disrupted in DNAI1 and DNAI5 mutants. In the nose, these structures are covered with G-protein coupled olfactory receptors, and modified ones make up the dendritic knob of olfactory neurons. A series of BBS proteins localize to these structure, whose mutations cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Defects in them also cause situs inversus in Kartagenar's syndrome, which occurs because they are needed for propelling morphogens around during development. The presence of these organelles in Fallopian tubes propels the egg towards the uterus, and they're also found on the surface epithelium of the respiratory tract, where their beating helps clear mucous and debris. For 10 points, name these small hairlike projections on the surface of some cells.
