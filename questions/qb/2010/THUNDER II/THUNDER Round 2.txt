In order to illustrate the validity of this principle, Karl Rodbertus bought a piece of land in Prussia and put aside his wealth to illustrate its effects.  A rejection of this idea was proposed by George Gunton because the actual market price of the quantity in question is determined by the standard of living of a region, which is in turn determined by the “habitual wants customs” of the social character of that region's inhabitants. According to Ferdinand Lasalle, combating the negative effects of this principle can only be done through the (*) cooperatives established through the funds of a state.
