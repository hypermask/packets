In this work's seventeenth chapter, the author likens conquest to foreign usurpation and usurpation in one's own country to a domestic conquest - however, in the latter case right can never be on the usurper's side. A long section of this work argues that the law that governed Adam was “the law of reason” and the fundamental purpose of all laws after him is to “preserve and enlarge freedom.” The justification of slavery is presented in its fourth chapter, which was influenced by its author's authorship of the Fundamental (*) Orders of the Carolinas. In another chapter, the author illustrates his point by picking an apple and claiming it is his apple because he has offered the labor necessary to obtain it. It was published alongside a work that attacked the Filmerians.

answer: {Entropy}

Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew defined a topological version of this quantity equal to the limit of a quantity involving the cover of a Hausdorff space. A relative version of this quantity is calculated between two probability distributions by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Another version is found by multiplying the density matrix by its logarithm and taking the trace. For another system this quantity is proportional to one over four times the Planck length squared, multiplied by the area of the event horizon of a black hole. This quantity is proportional to the log of the volume divided by the number of particles times the third power of the thermal wavelength plus five-halves for a monotomic ideal gas. Its equal to the log of the number of microstates times the Boltzmann constant. This quantity always increases in a closed system according to the Second law of thermodynamics. For 10 points, name this quantity, the disorder of a system.

The DraG and DraT ribosyltransferases control the central enzyme of this process in R Rubrum. 6-cyanopurine can differentially stain bacteria that have mutations in genes controlling this process. One organism that carries out this process operates via either the sanctions hypothesis or the partner-choice hypothesis. Klebsilla pneumoniae is used as a model for this process. The operons that control this process, which are partly regulated by the GlnR locus' transcription of NtrC and NtrB, encodes a series of 20 genes and are known as the Nif operons. The presence of leghemoglobin in structures that perform this process is necessary to remove oxygen, since that poisons the molybdenum-containing complex central to it. Carried out by rhizobia in root nodules and involving the cleavage of a strong triple bond, for 10 points, name this process that cleaves diatomic nitrogen into ammonia.

answer: {shortest path} subgraph

One of these objects gives its name to a protocol which consists of making a distinction between not so stubby areas and stubby areas and is an example of a protocol that uses link state routing. A dynamic programming approach to finding one returns the minimum of two recursively defined functions, and is used to find the “all-pairs” variety of this entity in “big O of V cubed time”; that is the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. The possibility of one of these objects with a finite number of vertexes can be determined by the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The problem of finding them was first solved with a model of ant colonies, while a different way of finding them is to use a heuristic function that takes into account distance and cost. If there are no negative edge cycles, one uses A* or Djikstra's algorithm to produce them. For 10 points, name this subgraph that consists of the smallest sum of edge weights between two points on a graph.
