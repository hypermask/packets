answer: the {Second White Lotus} Rebellion [or {Chu?n ch? bái lián jiào q?} yì; or {Pai}-{lien chiao}]

Nine years after it was quashed, affiliates of its fomenters captured Hua during the Eight Trigrams Uprising. Several years before it, Wang Lun led a precursor to this revolt. Internal strife during it stemmed from the massive corruption of the Qianlong Emperor's favorite, Heshen, whose ouster at the hands of the Jiaqing Emperor helped put this rebellion down. The agitators of this uprising believed in the coming of the Maitreya and led a secret organization. It was centered in mountains between Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces. For 10 points, name this uprising against the Qing Dynasty, a rebellion that occurred from 1796 to 1804 and is named for a Buddhist society.

answer: {Ohm's} law

It is an example of linear response theory, analogous to Fourier's law of heat transport, and thus there is a Kubo formula relating the proportionality constant in it to a two-point correlation function of electric currents. Diodes are prominent examples of materials that do not satisfy it, because they permit a flow of current in only one direction. This law can be derived from the Lorentz force with the assumption that there is a drag on charge carriers that is proportional to their velocity. Kirchoff formulated a continuum version of it equating current density to electric field times conductivity of a material. Its most familiar form states that the current through a conductor is proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to resistance. For 10 points, name this law that shares its name with the SI unit of electrical impedance.

answer: Grendel

One character in this work is knocked out by a barrage of apples thrown by the protagonist.  Its protagonist pretends to be “the Destroyer” while sitting among a ring of statues and, while there, listens to a metaphysical theory laid out by the priest Ork. Near the beginning of this novel, the main character is wounded by a bull after passing through a pool of fire-snakes and becoming stuck in a tree. At its end, its protagonist tells a crowd of animals that he's “had an accident” and adds “So may you all.” The nature of the songs sung by a blind harpist called “the Shaper” is explained to its protagonist by the omniscient, philosophizing Dragon; that protagonist spends most of this novel launching attacks against Hart. For 10 points, identify this novel whose titular protagonist has his arm ripped off by an unnamed Geat hero, a retelling of Beowulf written by John Gardner.

answer: {William} Turner {Walton}

Only one page survives of a work by this man subtitled “A Pedagogic Overture” and written to accompany a planned ballet co-written by Percy Wyndham Lewis. This composer of Dr. Syntax scored the film The First of the Few, from which he extracted his Spitfire Prelude and Fugue. His second and last opera was billed as an “Extravaganza in One Act” and was composed to a libretto written by Paul Dehn based on a Chekhov play. This composer of the coronation marches, Orb and Sceptre and Crown Imperial wrote the operas The Bear and Troilus and Cressida.  He gained early fame for his orchestral setting of Edith Sitwell's Façade poems, but is best-known for setting texts from Psalms, Revelation, and Daniel to music.  For 10 points, identify this twentieth-century British composer of the oratorio Belshazzar's Feast.

answer: {Towards} a {New Architecture} [or {Towards} an {Architecture}; or {Vers une architecture}]

This work claims that primitive man's trouble planning a board is the origin of “regulating lines,” to which its author advocates a return. It discusses disastrous human attempts at bird-like flight before the development of the airfoil, before laying out several “fundamental axioms” amidst repeated claims that we must face either the title discipline “or revolution.” It also discusses the “problem of perfection” before turning to examples of clean and modern aesthetics, like automobiles and ocean liners, in its section “Eyes That Do Not See.” This book was made up of articles published in the magazine L'Esprit Nouveau and echoed its author's “five points,” as exemplified by his Villa Savoye. For 10 points, name this book, which proposed that a “house is a machine for living in,” a tract by Le Corbusier.

answer: {Elam} (or the {Elamite} Kingdom or {Haltamti})

A late king of this empire was defeated at the Battle of the Ulai River, shortly after which its king Khumma-Khaldash was captured. This kingdom apparently achieved great power under Shutruk-Nakhkhunte, who killed king Zababa-shuma-iddina and replaced him with his son Kutir-Nakhkhunte. A prominent architectural remnant of this kingdom is the Chogha Zanbil temple at its site of Dur Untash. Its early dynasties like the Avan and the Simash ruled from its capital at Anshan, though later kings of this empire frequently occupied Susa, up until it was brutally sacked by Ashurbanipal in 640 BC, reducing it to fragments. For 10 points, name this ancient kingdom to the east of Akkadia and Sumeria, which is represented by modern-day southwestern Iran.

answer: “The {True} Story of {Ah Q}”

The protagonist of this story is disgusted when he learns that people from a bigger town call a “long bench” a “straight bench”, and also refuses to say the words “ringworm”, “bright”, or “light”. Its protagonist harasses a nun from the Convent of Quiet Self-Improvement after losing a fight to Whiskers Wang; later, he shouts “Sleep with me!” at the maid Amah Wu, causing him to be kicked out of the Chao household. At the end of this story, its title character is too preoccupied drawing a perfect circle to realize he's being executed. Its title character also hates on the “Imitation Foreign Devil” and attempts to join the Xinhai revolution. For 10 points, identify this story about an idler from Weichuang who rationalizes defeats as “spiritual victories”, a work of Lu Xun.

answer: {osteoclasts}

FLG 29.1 is an immortalized line of precursors of this type of cell.  These cells lie in a hollow cavity called the Howship's lacuna and have a characteristic homogenous cytoplasm with a foamy appearance. They express the cysteine protease cathepsin K, which catabolizes elastin, collagen, and gelatin. They are regulated by parathyroid hormone, which activates them, and calcitonin and OPG, which repress them. They are also stimulated by interleukin-6, a protein that is overexpressed in osteoporosis. Their ruffled border contains a proton pump that plays a key role in these cells' dissolution of hydroxyapatite. For 10 points, what is this type of cell that is responsible for releasing calcium from bones into the blood, a process known as bone resorption?

answer: {Principia Ethica}

It argues that much confusion originated with the idea that some supersensible property exists and ends with a chapter celebrating the importance of “personal affection” entitled “The Ideal.”   This work, which stressed the importance of historical context in predicting what results would follow certain types of action, dismissed Herbert Spencer's ideas by declaring that his Darwinian outlook degenerated into “hedonism.”  In another section it posited that an evaluative term cannot be entirely defined by the way it is applied, a demonstration known as its author's “open question argument.”  This work argued that previous thinkers, like J.S. Mill, committed the “naturalistic fallacy” and it posited intuition as the solution to identifying what is bad and what is good.  Published in 1903, it built on the ideas of its author's mentor Henry Sidgwick, for 10 points, identify this work by G.E. Moore.

answer: {Varuna} [or {Waruna}; prompt on {Jhulelal} before mentioned]

In the proto-Indo-European dialogue “The King and the God”, the title king is told to pray to this figure in order to receive a child. The Sindhi festival of Cheti Chand is held in honor of the birth of Jhulelal, a reincarnation of this deity. This guardian of the west shares his mount with the goddess Ganga and is generally depicted as part-alligator or part-dolphin. This figure is known to wield a snake as a lasso, and, along with his brother Mitra, he is considered a god of rta and oaths. In the Ramayana, Rama angrily attempts to destroy the oceans when this god fails to respond to his prayers after three days. For 10 points, identify this chief of the Adityas who watches over the world with his thousand eyes, a Vedic deity of the sea.

answer: the {Keeling} curve [prompt on “{CO2 concentration}” or similar]

The measurements for it use a nondispersive infrared gas analyzer. Short-term measurements preceding it were taken in Pasadena and Big Sur, but this curve gives continuous observations since 1958. It shows a dip each year in summer, due to drawdown by photosynthesis, with annual variation of about 5 parts per million by volume. Observations for it are taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Initially it showed a concentration of about 315 ppmv, but the newest points on the curve are above 390 ppmv. The main cause of this rising trend is the burning of fossil fuels. It is discussed in An Inconvenient Truth as evidence for global warming. For 10 points, what is this graph, named for a scientist from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, that shows atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide?

answer: {Nazarenes} (or {Nazarener} or {Brotherhood} of St. {Luke} or {Lukesbund})

In Lionel Gossman's essay about this group he confusingly terms them the “Unwilling Moderns.” An early member of this group imitated an earlier Ingres painting with his The Entry of Rudolf of Hapsburg into Basel, and typified this group's style with his diptych of two contrasting women Shulamit and Maria. Another member executed a series of frescoes showing Dante, Ariosto, and Tasso as part of their communal decoration of the Villa Massimo. By then they had already taken up quarters at the monastery of San Isidro and their founder, in Assisi's Portiuncula Chapel, painted his major fresco on the Rose Miracle of St. Francis. As seen in their founder's The Triumph of Religion in the Arts, they sought to renew the style of the Renaissance through the Christian faith. For 10 points, name this group of German artists that included Peter Cornelius, Franz Pforr, and Johann Overbeck.

answer: the {South Sea} Bubble

This event marked the end of the political career of the founder of Studley Gardens Royal Park, John Aislabie. A jesting parliamentary resolution in the wake of it called for a certain group to be “tied up in a sack of snakes and tipped into the Thames.” A parliamentary act preceding it created the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation. This event coincided with a scandal in France and centered on an entity that was given exclusive rights to supply Spanish colonies with slaves in the Asiento of the Treaty of Utrecht. The shares of that company were used as equity for buying Britain's national debt. For 10 points, name this event surrounding a Robert Harley-founded joint-stock company, speculation in which drove an 1720 economic bubble.

answer: {George Akerlof} accept {Identity Economics} before “that {work}”

One of this man's books opens with a discussion of Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins and outlines the ways that identity features in norms and utility.  That work, Identity Economics, was co-written with Rachel Kranton.  He also argued that a “marriage shock” contributed to increased rates of crime and drug use in the United States in his, “Men Without Children.”  In his 2007 presidential address to the AEA, published as “The Missing Motivation in Macroeconomics,” he suggested that assuming decision-makers have “natural norms” would eliminate five “neutralities,” a theme he also expounded on in a book co-written with Robert Shiller. In his most famous work, he argued that concerns over quality uncertainty would result in prices that result in “the bad driving out the good” and cause market failure. For 10 points, identify this economist, who illustrated asymmetric information through used cars in his 1970 paper “The Market for Lemons.”

answer: the {Confessing} Church [accept the {Confessional Church} or {Bekennende Kirche}]

The memoir The Forger is dedicated in part to one member of this group, Helene Jacobs, and describes its author being sheltered by another prominent member, Franz Kaufmann. It grew out of an earlier organization that was formed to oppose the introduction of a certain paragraph into the statutes of the 28 regional churches; that earlier organization was the Emergency Covenant of Pastors. The founding document of this group asserts that the Church is “solely [the] property” of Christ and denies the “false doctrine” that considers it an organ of the State, a position held by the Reichskirche. That document is the Barmen Declaration. For 10 points, identify this splinter group that resisted the Nazification of the German Protestant Church, founded in part by and associated with Dietrich Bonhöffer and Karl Barth.

answer: {Adlai Ewing Stevenson} I or {Adlai Ewing Stevenson}, {Sr.} [do not accept “{Adlai Stevenson II}”; “{Adlai Stevenson III}”; etc.]

This man earned a Vice Presidential nomination after Indiana senator Benjamin Shively downplayed his interest. As Assistant Postmaster General, he conducted an 1885 purge of Republicans. If an operation to replace the sitting president's upper jaw due to mouth cancer had gone sour, this man would have become president. In 1900, Minnesotan Charles Towne was nominated for Vice President on the Populist ticket with William Jennings Bryan, but the Democrats nominated this man as Bryan's VP candidate. He was thus the first man to serve as VP and be nominated for VP with a different running mate. For 10 points, name this VP during Grover Cleveland's second term, an Illinois governor and grandfather of a same-named “egghead” who lost to Dwight Eisenhower twice.

answer: Convention of {Gastein}

Adolph Deschamps wrote a book titled after this agreement that Count Golz said, “puts us permanently on the path of trickery, force, and violation of law.” A dispatch published in the Independence Belge from the British Prime Minister at the time refers to this agreement as having been trodden under foot. This agreement was negotiated after one of the parties had defeated Christian of Glucksburg in a war that saw battles at Lundby and Heligoland, and it divided two neighboring polities, which were soon admitted into the Zollverein. The Seven Weeks War was fought in part due to breach in this agreement that was negotiated by Otto von Bismarck, and affected the makeup of a prominent German customs union.  For 10 points, name this August 1865 agreement that resolved the dispute over the governance of Schleswig-Holstein, a convention named for a resort town in Austria.

answer: {Faust Symphony}

In an 1862 essay, Richard Pohl observed five motifs in this musical work, which he designated as conveying “Passion”, “Pride”, “Longing”, “Triumph”, and “Love” respectively. A melody played on oboe and clarinet expresses the “painful joys” of the central figure in the first movement, while the image of a woman picking petals from a flower is evoked by violins and clarinets in the second movement. A male chorus was eventually added to its third movement, the “Chorus Mysticus”, singing that “everything transitory is but a semblance” in praise of that which “draws us ever onward” called the “Eternal Feminine”. The second of the three “character sketches” that comprise the work centers on the figure of Gretchen, while the third centers on the demon Mephistopheles. For 10 points, identify this work by Franz Liszt.
