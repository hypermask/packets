answer: {Henri Rousseau} (or Le {Douanier Rousseau}) [{Douanier meaning} customs inspector]

The year after he died, a memorial exhibition of his works was organized by Wilhelm Uhde [oo-duh], who also wrote the first biography of this artist.  His technique always involved painting individual colors one by one and painting from the top of the canvas to the bottom.  His portraits include those of Pierre Loti and Leon-Paul Fargue, as well as a self-portrait with a lamp.  Whimsy and disproportion typify such canvases as Unpleasant Surprise, The Merry Jesters, Boy on the Rocks and The Football Players.  Yet, it is the exoticism of such paintings as The Dream and The Snake Charmer that set him apart.  His nickname was given not for his art but for the many years he worked as a customs inspector.  For 10 points, name this man who often painted jungle scenes featuring lions and tigers, such as in his magnum opus The Sleeping Gypsy.

answer: {David Lewis}

With Michael Smith and Mark Johnston he advanced a meta-ethical theory holding that something is valued if, and only if, we would be disposed to value it under ideal circumstances.  He explored what it meant to introduce a new theoretical term into science in such papers as “Tensing the Copula” and “Void and Object.”  This process, called Ramseyfication, was also employed in his, “An Argument for Identity Theory,” to make a case for mind-brain monism.  He asserted the importance of tracing local matters of particular fact, a metaphysical doctrine that he called “Humean supervenience,” and employed techniques from game-theory to describe norms as resulting from coordination problems in his first work, Convention.  Best known for championing modal realism, For 10 points, identify this philosopher who wrote On the Plurality of Worlds.

answer: of Las {Navas} de {Tolosa}

The victors in this battle were accompanied by Arnold Amalric, the archbishop of Narbonne, who wrote several letters describing the victory. Another account claims that the tent of the losing army was surrounded by a human wall of ten thousand slaves and a bunch of iron chains which were cut. The victors used an obscure mountain pass marked by the skull of a cow, shown to them by a local shepherd, who escorted the vanguard under Diego Lopez de Haro through the pass. The winning force was avenging the “Disaster of Alarcos,” which necessitated this campaign. They decimated the army under Miramamolin through a combined effort of Sancho VII, Pedro II, and Alfonso VIII of . For 10 points, name this battle which crippled the Almohad Empire and marked a victory in 1212 AD for the Spanish Reconquista.

answer: {Europa}

Manann'an is a 30 kilometer crater on it, from an impact that penetrated dark terrain to reveal brighter material. A region consisting of hummocky terrain with blocks several kilometers across, known as the Conamara Chaos, suggests that its outer layer is only a few hundred meters thick in places. For the most part, its surface has high albedo and is smooth, broken by lenticulae and lineae. Relatively few craters suggest a surface younger than 50 million years. Magnetometer measurements indicate its internal magnetic field changes over time, suggesting that it has a conducting layer, which may be a salty liquid ocean beneath its icy surface. These measurements were carried out by the Galileo spacecraft. For 10 points, what is this smallest of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter?

answer: {Pilgrimage} of {Grace} (or {Yorkshire Uprising} of 1536; accept equivalents for {uprising})

Wilfrid Holme, a contemporary writer, noted that the participants in this incident often sang songs from the prophecies of Merlin and carried a large banner showing the five wounds of Christ. It was born out of anger that had broken out two weeks earlier with an attack on John Meneage and its rapid growth led the Pope to grant legatine powers to Reginald Pole to lead it. Those involved met at Pontefract to organize their demands, which would not be met resulting in Bigod's Insurrection one month later. The assumed leader, Robert Aske, was tricked by the Duke of Norfolk and he was executed as a result. Among other things, those involved wanted the repeal of the Ten Articles, the removal of Thomas Cromwell, and the reestablishment of papal authority. For 10 points, identify this 1536 rebellion against Henry VIII, named for the presumably sacred journey undertaken by the participants

answer: The {Shadow} of a {Gunman}

This play's second act begins with reflections on Shelley's verse and features a speech deriding a poet's responsibility to the people.  That speech is interrupted when one of the main characters hears a “tappin'” that portends death.  Later in the play a distraught wife complains that her husband never returned to Hilljoy Square from the Blue Lion pub.  During the first Act, Mr. Gallogher seeks out the protagonist and reads him a complaint letter to Mr. Dwyer, while a young man assures him that he awaits the call to action.  However, when the Auxiliary arrives, it is neither Tommy Owens nor the meek title character that put up any resistance.  Instead the most courageous tenement residents turn out to be the verbose Mrs. Henderson and the doomed Minnie Powell. For 10 points, identify this tragicomic play about Donal Davoren, who pretends to be the titular IRA assassin; a work by Sean O'Casey.

answer: Filippo {Brunelleschi}

Hungarian artist Istvan Orosz recreated an experiment in perspective by this man in a 2000 installation using a sheet and a mirror. He had a large ship named Badalone built to transport many of his supplies, but the ship sank on its first voyage nearly bankrupting him. Visual representations of him are scarce and include his portrait in Donatello's Beardless Prophet and a presumed appearance in Masaccio's Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus. His own works include his first commission, the so-called Hospital of the Innocents, and his last, the Pazzi Chapel. However, his fame rested on solving a problem that had confounded Arnolfo di Cambio 120 years earlier. For 10 points, name this man who won the right to design the dome of the Florence Cathedral seventeen years after finishing second to Ghiberti in the contest to design the second doors of the Florentine Baptistery.

The process in which two objects scatter by radiating virtual photons that combine into an electron-positron pair is named for Walter Heitler and this physicist. The one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain can be solved by factorizing general n-body scattering processes into two-body scattering processes, as described by his namesake ansatz. His name, along with that of Felix Bloch, is attached to a formula for energy loss of charged particles in matter. Bound states in relativistic quantum field theory can be studied using an integral equation developed by Edwin Salpeter and him. He postulated that stars are driven by nuclear reactions converting hydrogen to helium. For 10 points, name this Cornell physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project and calculated the Lamb shift.

answer: The {Lonely Crowd}

It introduced the term “false personalization” and analyzed Mr. Belevedere films in its chapter on “the problem of competence.” In a subsequent edition, its author acknowledged the critiques made in “Work and Its Discontents,” by William Bell, who noted that too much of it concerned leisure.  Such a focus is exemplified by this work's discussion of society's interest in food from “the Wheat Bowl” to the “Salad Bowl,” as well as a section on how the “the night shift” and the entry of women into the office impacted the consumption of popular culture.  Its composition arose out of an interdisciplinary course on “Culture and Personality” developed at the University of Chicago.  That research culminated in this collaboration with Reuel Denney and Nathan Glazer.  For 10 points, identify this work that posited a distinction between inner and outer directed types and was subtitled “A Study of the American Character,” by David Riesman.

The defeat of one country in this set of conflicts led one of its citizens to publish the Illustrated Gazetteer of Maritime Countries advocating military upgrades. In between them the losing country was forced to the ban the Spanish dollar and switch to the Mexican dollar before finally issuing paper currency. The final one was marked by the collaboration of forces under James Bruce and Baron Gros, such as in the capture of the Taku forts. They were marked by the so-called period of “Unequal Treaties,” referring to such agreements as the treaties of Whampoa and Bogue. One included an early blockade of the Pearl River and the other was set off by the storming of the HMS Arrow. For 10 points, name these conflicts concluded by the treaties of Tientsin and Nanking, which were fought over the namesake substance between France and Britain and China.

The disruption of one of these in a common kinase G-loop structure mediates the phenotype of WeeB mice and appears to inhibit imatinib binding in E255K Bcr-Abl mutants.  Gas-phase zwitterions can be stabilized either by charge solvation or by these interactions.  The Bohr effect is mediated by the formation of one of these between a histidine and an arginine in deoxyhemoglobin, and in the heptad repeats of coiled coils, these are formed between e and g residues.  This type of bond shares its name with a structure that may consist of a glass tube filled with sodium nitrate.  For 10 points, name this term that describes either an electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged moieties of a macromolecule or the structure that connects the oxidative and reductive halves of a galvanic cell.

answer: {square planar}

A common feature of hydration-promoting catalysts, such as chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium, Wilkinson's catalyst, is the adoption of this molecular structure.  Hoogsteen pairing gives rise to complexes with this configuration which are composed of hydrogen-bonded guanines stabilized around a potassium cation.  The central atoms in these compounds usually possess the d8 electron configuration, and, as in octahedral compounds, the kinetics of substitution reactions in compounds with this type of geometry are strongly influenced by the trans ligand. An exemplary compound exhibiting this geometry is cisplatin.  For 10 points, name this type of molecular geometry characterized by two nonbonding and four bonding electron pairs, in which the four substituents are situated ninety degrees apart on the same plane as the central atom.
