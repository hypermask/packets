answer: {Chinese remainder theorem}

Equations with a solution in the reals and in the p-adics for each prime p have a rational solution by the Hasse principle, an application of this statement. The decomposition of the finitely generated modules of a Dedekind domain into the direct sum of submodules is managed by this statement. The Good-Thomas algorithm for the fast Fourier transform uses this statement on the output, in conjunction with a mapping called Ruritanian on the input, to reindex data. An extension of this statement to principal ideal domains gives an isomorphism between a quotient ring and a product of quotient rings. For 10 points, name this statement that guarantees an integer solution to a set of congruence relations if the moduli are pairwise relatively prime.

answer: {amniotes} [accept word forms like {amniotic}, {amniota}, etc.]

A debate among Nussbaum, Wilkinson, Laurin, and Reisz ended with the conclusion that the ancestral member of this group of organisms lacked EER; a central issue in this debate was the classification of caecilians.  Early members of this group of organisms could be distinguished from their ancestors by the presence of eleventh and twelfth cranial nerves and the astralagus bone in the ankle, and the Joggins fossils indicate that this group of organisms diverged into the synapsids and sauropsids. Another synapomorphy of this clade contains several sacs, including the allantois, the chorion, and its namesake sac, and its development permitted vertebrates to expand further inland.  For 10 points, name this clade that encompasses most living terrestrial animals and which is named for a structure which, in humans, is a fluid-filled membrane surrounding the fetus.

answer: {torque}

A type of magnetoresistive RAM uses a spin-polarized current to reorient the magnetization of a layer of a TMR element; that type is called spin this transfer. A stepper motor has different “pull-in” and “pull-out” values of this. In 1939 Richard Beth measured this exerted on a doubly-refracting plate by polarized light. The cogging type of this is minimized in motors and results from the interaction between rotor and stator magnets. Four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration are called a “load cell” or a this “transducer,” which is one component of a quality-control device that measures this quantity. Precession is called “gyroscopic” if induced by this quantity. For 10 points, name this cross product of displacement with force, equal to the time derivative of angular momentum, the rotational analogue of force.

Peri-acylated gossylic versions of these compounds are potent inhibitors of lactate dehydrogenase, explaining their antimalarial activity. This compound may be used as the acylating agent in a variant of the Friedel-Crafts reaction that produces a ketimine intermediate. Under nickel catalysis aryl examples of these compounds will add across triple bonds, and nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to one of these substances in the first step of the Pinner reaction produces imides. A condensation of these compounds named for Thorpe forms enamines. .

Its T664P mutant is known as the “O-helix mutant,” while the substitution of phenylalanine for valine at position 667 promotes chain termination by this protein.  A commonly used purification approach for this enzyme involves a one-hour incubation at 75 degrees followed by cation exchange chromatography.  This enzyme may be used in a non-cyclic process to prepare inserts into Topo-linked vectors, and an eponymous probe system relies upon the separation of fluors from quenchers by this enzyme's 5' to 3' exonucleolytic activity.  Unlike similar proteins, this enzyme leaves overhanging As, which is useful in the aforementioned TA cloning process but makes it a worse choice for blunt-end cloning than Pfu. For 10 points, name this PCR reagent, a high-fidelity polymerase derived from Thermus aquaticus.
