In early life, this ruler suffered an injury in a duel with a member of the Pacas family that sidelined him while his brother Marek died. His numerous love letters use the pet name "Marysie?ka" for his wife Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange. He would defeat Petro Doroshenko at the Battle of Podhacje and quashed the rebellion incited by his former commander Lubomirski. His victory at Chocim coincided with the death of his predecessor Michael I, allowing him to take power. In another action he came to the aid of Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg by leading a charge of his Winged Hussars. For 10 points, name this King of Poland who defeated Kara Mustafa at the 1683 Battle of Vienna.

answer: {Concord Sonata} or Piano {Sonata No.} 2, {Concord}, {Mass.}, 1840-60

This work's performance notes state that the title figure of its fourth movement “much prefers to hear” that movement's optional flute part.  This work's second movement quotes Debussy's “Golliwog's Cake-Walk” and Columbia, Gem of the Oceans, and calls for a 14 ¾-inch strip of wood to be used to produce a massive tone cluster.  All four movements of this piece quote a work of the same form, Beethoven's Hammerklavier.  This work's fourth movement draws on the composer's lost work Walden Sounds, while its first movement draws on the Emerson Overture for Piano and Orchestra.  For 10 points, name this piece whose movements include depictions of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and other residents of the title city, composed by Charles Ives.

answer: {Vicksburg}

Important primary sources about the conflict to take this location include the diary of Will Tummard and letters exchanged between members of the Lord family, residents of this place. An earlier attempt to take it saw Thomas Craven forced to turn back by mechanical breakdowns while Young's Point and Helena were used as staging grounds. To support the attack Nathaniel Banks struck to the south and, after the Battle of Plains Store, began a siege of Port Hudson.  Commanders inside this city included William Loring, who lost earlier at Champion Hill, and Martin L. Smith who was actually a New Yorker. Assaults on it ordered by Grant were all repulsed, but John C. Pemberton ultimately surrendered this city after 47 days. For 10 points, identify this Mississippi city besieged by the Union during the Civil War.

answer: {Hartree}-{Fock} self-consistent field method [prompt on {self}-{consistent field method}]

This approach accounts for Fermi correlation but fails to account for dynamic correlation, which can be dealt with using the configuration interaction approach.  The one-particle Hamiltonian plus the sum over particles of the difference of the Coulomb and exchange operators gives an operator whose eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are the quantities of interest.  The relevant Coulomb operator uses the mean field to approximate the electron-electron interactions in this method, which applies the variational principle in solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.  Wavefunctions described by Slater determinants are used in, for 10 points, what self-consistent field method for approximating the ground-state wavefunction and energy of multi-electron systems?

answer: {Charles Sanders Peirce} ({pronounced} as in “{purse}”)

This philosopher argued that “metaphysics was the ape of mathematics” in his survey “The Architecture of Theories.” He posited a triadic relation to account for the element of spontaneity that informs the neurological faculties and published a work that argued for a physical explanation of feeling by “framing a molecular theory of protoplasm.”  That work, “Man's Glassy Essence,” was preceded by “Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed by Man,” which held that even abstract thoughts have the character of signs.  In another essay he analogized thinking to a sequence of notes; that work, along with another piece advocating the use of the scientific method, were first published in Popular Science Monthly.  For 10 points, identify this philosopher who wrote “How to Make Our Ideas Clear” and “The Fixation of Belief.”

answer: {Tyche} or {Fortuna}

Warning: Greek or Roman version acceptable.  According to Pausanias, inquirers at the oracle of Trophonius in Lebadeia had to spend several days in a house sacred to the ‘Agathos Daimon' and the Greek version of this deity, who was said to be an Oceanid in Hesiod's Theogony.  Like Demeter, she was sometimes depicted carrying a cornucopia or the Ploutos child.  As a patron goddess of various cities she was depicted wearing mural crowns shaped like each city's battlements, and she was often shown carrying a rudder or a ball.  The Roman version of this goddess was associated with Bonus Eventus, while the Greek version was associated with Nemesis, who provided a counterbalance to her favors.  At her temple at Argos, the hero Palamedes supposedly dedicated the first-ever pair of dice.  FTP, name this goddess of luck whose Roman equivalent is invoked in a section of the Carmina Burana.

answer: {core formation} [prompt on {planetary differentiation} before (*)]

For the Earth, one step in this process was the incorporation of the Hadean matte into the namesake structure.  Chronometers for this process include the hafnium-182/tungsten-182 system, and the uranium-235/uranium-238/lead-207/lead-206 system.  In large, rocky bodies the final stage of material transport in this process is thought to involve the sinking of large metal diapirs from the bottoms of magma oceans.  The hafnium-tungsten and uranium-lead chronometers for this process rely on the fact that the parent elements are strongly lithophile, while this process preferentially concentrates siderophiles in the central structure.  For 10 points, name this most energetic event in terrestrial planetary differentiation (*) which results in a dense, iron-rich central region underneath a lighter mantle.

The creator of this artwork partly drew on a concurrent portrait of its subject by Marie Benoist. It came to be housed in a building designed by Giovanni Marchetti and in a room containing a ceiling fresco on the same subject by Domenico de Angelis. A brief scandal erupted in 2007 when its artist was accused of taking plaster casts of his sitter's breasts, which proved false, though he did design the crank in its wooden base that allowed it to be rotated. The subject has a bracelet around her right arm, which supports her head, and she holds an apple in her left hand in reference to the “Judgment of Paris.” She reclines on a Roman sofa and is nude above the waist. For 10 points, name this sculpture that sought to equate its subject with Aphrodite, a work by Antonio Canova depicting the sister of Napoleon.

The Periochae is a summary of this man's major work, which draws on writings of Quintus Fabius Pictor and the other Annalists, and on Polybius. In that major work, this man's account of a siege includes the stories of Cloelia and Mucius Scaevola, who impress Lars Porsena, a king of the Etruscans. That work by this man closes with the death of Claudius's father Nero Claudius Drusus, and opens with the arrival of Aeneas's arrival in Italy.  For 10 points, name this historian whose Ab urbe condita is a 142-book history of Rome that inspired some Discourses by Machiavelli.

At one point, the narrator recounts the story of a man who arrived in town to challenge all to a pigeon shooting contest.  When it turns out that he had strapped firecrackers to the pigeons in an attempt to cheat, the town tars and feathers him. This occurs after the narrator reminisces about how the protagonist worked setting posts for old man Whaley to buy the rifle he always carried.  In another scene the main character comes upon a woman in the road and rips off her white gown; after she accuses him of rape, he is arrested but soon let go. The protagonist, who ends up living in a cave on Frog Mountain, discovers a dead woman and, after dressing her up, has sex with her.  Set in Sevier County, Tennessee, it describes a series of macabre events culminating in the title figure being sent to the State Hospital and dissected.

answer: {originalism} (accept word forms; accept {judicial restraint}, prompt on {strict construction})

Louis Feldman attempts to reconcile this concept with Joseph Raz's theories, concluding that the attitude this position requires is equivalent to a deference to practical authority. Richard Kay argues for a version of this that goes beyond the mere words of a provision and including the intentions of the text. Amy Guttman coauthored A Matter of Interpretation, which sets forward a theory of this type, justifying it by appealing to the US's common-law history. That book's primary author called this doctrine “The Lesser Evil” in an influential 1989 Cincinnati Law Review article, arguing that it was superior to activist theories.  Those works are by Antonin Scalia. For 10 points, identify this theory of legal interpretation supported by members of the Federalist Society that emphasizes the intent or meaning at the time of formulation.

answer: {potential} [accept {incompressible irrotational} before (*); do not accept or prompt on {incompressible}, but {suit yourself}]

This type of inviscid flow around a cylinder has streamlines that are exactly reproduced outside of a small boundary layer by Hele-Shaw flow.  This type of flow is equivalent to incompressible, irrotational (*) flow, and satisfies Laplace's equation for a namesake function associated with the velocity.  In thermodynamics, this term denotes the internal energy and all Legendre transforms of the internal energy.  In electrodynamics, the Liénard-Wiechert equations give the retarded forms of two versions of this quantity, and the magnetic field equals the curl of the vector version of this quantity.  Any conservative force can be described as the negative gradient of one of these scalar functions.  For 10 points, give this term denoting a type of energy associated with the configuration of a system, such as the energy stored in a compressed spring.

answer: {maximum likelihood} estimation method

When the result of this procedure has a unique value, then that value is a function of every sufficient statistic.  The covariance matrices of quantities generated by this method are commonly approximated by the inverse of the Fisher information matrix.  Under appropriate regularity conditions, this method gives results that are equivariant, consistent, asymptotically normal and asymptotically efficient.  This method's namesake function is the data's joint density treated as a function of the parameter being estimated, and that namesake function appears in Bayes' theorem as the unnormalized ratio of the posterior and prior probability densities.  In carrying out this procedure it is often more convenient to replace that namesake function by its logarithm.  For 10 points, name this method of parameter estimation which gives the parameter values that make the observed data most probable.

In Aztec myth this position is held by a deity who is also associated with feasts and gaming, the little black god Ixtlilton, while in Phoenician myth this role is filled by Sidon's tutelary deity Eshmun.  In Shinto myth a god of sorcery and farming named Okuninushi also fills this role, and in Hindu myth Saranyu's sons are divine horsemen who hold this position.  Those gods are all patrons of an activity associated with a magical pigskin retrieved by the sons of Tuireann.  In Greek myth this position is primarily filled by a god whose sons Podalirius and Machaon served the Greek army at Troy, and among the Tuatha Dé Danann this is the role of Dian Cecht.
