answer: {curvature} (accept “{sectional curvature}” before the word “{sectional}”)

The Cartan-Hadamard theorem says that the universal cover of a manifold where this is nonpositive is diffeomorphic to Euclidean space; more precisely, it requires that all the sectional ones are nonpositive. For a connection on a principal bundle, viewed as a gauge field, it is the field strength two-form. For a torus, it is intrinsically zero, but there can be an extrinsic one from the embedding in a Euclidean space. A surface's Euler characteristic is related by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to the integral of the Gaussian form of it over the surface. The Riemann tensor is one measure of it. For the sphere, it is positive, while for a saddle, it is negative. For 10 points, what is this quantity, measuring an obstruction to mapping a space isometrically onto flat Euclidean space?

answer: {Alfred Mossman Landon}

The story of this man is told in the book Deeds Not Deficits by Richard Fowler, which contains a forward by the journalist whose career was backed by this politician, William Allen White. This man delivered a lecture entitled “New Challenges in International Relations” as the first in a series now named after him. He narrowly defeated Harry Woodring in one election during which he gained the nickname “the Fox,” but he's better remembered for a candidacy which led him to be the target of the joke “As Maine goes, so goes Vermont” - since those were the only two states he won. This former governor of  lost that election running alongside Frank Knox, and his poor showing led his party to replace him four years later with Wendell Willkie. For 10 points, name this Republican who badly lost to FDR in 1936.

answer: Thomas {Malthus}

In one work, this thinker wrote that “the proper office of benevolence is to soften the partial evils arising from self-love, but it can never be substituted in its place.” He called for less reliance on foreign politics in The Grounds of an Opinion, while another work defines a certain concept as “the reward of present valour and wisdom as well as of past strength.” Elsewhere, he argued that “moral restraint” is the only feasible “preventative check,” but will not succeed without universal suffrage and education. This author of Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent used that work to present some “Remarks on the Speculations of Mr. Godwin, Condorcet, and Other Writers,” arguing that means of subsistence increase by an arithmetic ratio doomed to lag behind the geometric ratio of population increase. For 10 points, name this British classical economist who wrote Essay on the Principal of Population.

answer: {Meditations} on First {Philosophy}

This work's Preface claims inspiration from Apollonius and Pappus' geometry in its method of exigesis.  Its final section dismisses the efficacy of a particular counterargument based on the notion that man, at times, knows not whether he is asleep or awake, by noting that one's memory never joins dreams to the other actions of life.  That discussion is preceded by the author's argument for “extension” as an essential property, which cites the example of a ball of wax that melts and changes shape but remains the same substance.  Dedicated to “the deans and doctors of the faculty of sacred theology in Paris,” its fourth section argues all that we perceive is true, while the fifth section offers a “new proof” for the existence of God.  For 10 points, identify this essay which responded to the queries prompted by its author's previous piece, Discourse on Method, a work by Rene Descartes.

answer: {black hole} [accept {Schwarzschild} until the word “{chiral}”]

A double analytic continuation of this type of solution reveals the "bubble of nothing" instability of the Kaluza-Klein vacuum, as discovered by Edward Witten. Recently, a correspondence between a chiral half of a two-dimensional conformal field theory and those of extremal Kerr type has been suggested. Above a minimum temperature, anti de Sitter space has a phase transition to a space containing one of these, as shown by Page and Hawking. They have entropy proportional to their area, and a temperature proportional to their surface gravity. Supermassive ones lie at the center of most or all galaxies. For 10 points, what are these objects in general relativity, discovered originally by Karl Schwarzschild, from which light does not escape?

answer: The {Children's} Crusade

Pieter Raedt's landmark 1977 article questioned many of the accounts of this event. Aubrey of Trois-Fontaines, in mentioning the disaster that befell some of its members in an expedition possibly organized by the merchants William Porcus and Hugh Ferreus, recounted how Gregory IX built a church to honor those who died.  The chronicler Wendover wrote of the large contingent of prostitutes and how one of its leaders claimed to have received a letter to the King of France from a pilgrim who was Jesus. Some of it would end due to orders from Phillip II, while the remainder mostly petered out when seas at Genoa failed to part. After getting suckered into “free transport” at Marseilles, some participants were sold into the Egyptian slave market. Led by Stephen of Cloyes and Nicholas of Cologne and coming in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, for 10 points, name this expedition to the Holy Land led by some youths.

According to one story, Leonard Hutter was so enraged by an authoritative appeal to this man's ideas, that he trampled on this man's portrait.  He championed the concept of the sensus literalis rather than the doctrine of the four senses championed by the Scholastics.  His lectures to visiting Hungarians on Sundays and Feast days were the origin of his namesake “Homilies.”  He opposed the ideas of Karlstadt and argued for a spiritual sense of duty or righteous conscience.  He helped edit The Letters of Obscure Men, a satire against his granduncle Johann Reuchlin's ecclesiastical enemies.  Known by the epithet, Praeceptor Germaniae, his work Common Topics in Theology was an extensive formulation of Protestant doctrine.  In 1530 he attempted to reconcile all Christian belief in a statement presented to Emperor Charles V.  For 10 points, identify this reformer and author of the Augsburg Confession.

CAAX is a recognition motif for an enzyme that adds this type of molecule to Ras and other proteins.  The cyclization of these compounds involves enzymes with an “aspartate-rich” DXXDD motif that produce intermediates like bornyl diphosphate.  Biosynthesis of some of these compounds, such as artemesinin, takes place in specialized secretory structures like glandular trichomes, where a plastidial type of synthesis is employed.  Enzymes important in their production include DXR and HMGR, and these compounds are derived from two isomeric precursors, IPP and DMAPP, which can be generated from either 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate or mevalonic acid.  Examples of this class of compounds include taxanes and giberellins, as well as squalene, testosterone, and other steroids.
