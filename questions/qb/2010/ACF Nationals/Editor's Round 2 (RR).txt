answer: {Great Exhibition} of 1851 (or the Crystal Palace {Exhibition} before mention of “{Crystal}”)

This event was facilitated by a report by Matthew Digby Wyatt and an account of it was written by John Tallis, who exclaimed that it caused “all social distinctions” to merge in a general feeling of pride. It was notably depicted by George Cruikshank in etchings in a book by Henry Mayhew entitled The Adventures of Mr. and Mrs. Sandboys, which intimately showed this event as resembling a giant beehive. Originally conceived by Henry Cole, its attendees included George Jennings and Frederick Bakewell. The introduction of “shilling days” drew enormous crowds at this event, which was funded by Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and was followed two years later by one in New York City. For 10 points, name this 1851 event centered around the Crystal Palace designed by Joseph Paxton in London.

answer: {electric dipole moment} [or {EDM}; prompt on “{dipole moment}”]

A recent experiment at the Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble found that that of the neutron is no larger than 3 times 10 to the minus 26 e-centimeters. This and a similar bound for electrons are interesting probes of fundamental violation of parity and time reversal symmetries. For a dielectric sphere, it is proportional to the relative permittivity minus one, divided by the relative permittivity plus 2, a result known as the Clausius-Mossotti formula. For a general charge distribution, it is given by an integral of the position multiplied by the charge density. For the simple case of two equal and opposite point charges, it is simply the product of the distance between them and the charge. For 10 points, what is this quantity, related to the strength of the second term in a multipole expansion?

answer: {Woolworth} Building

The lobby and arcade of this building has a cruciform plan and the lobby's ceiling is laid with colored glass in Byzantine mosaic style. The lobby's halls include a set of humorous gargoyles depicting people instrumental in its construction such as Edward J. Hogan, its first rental agent, and Gunvald Aus, one of the original design engineers. Its heavy steel frame is hidden by its detailed terra cotta shell and Gothic exterior. This building's early symbolism was marked by twin murals at the mezzanine level depicting “Labor” and “Commerce,” one of reasons it was once dubbed the “Chamber of Commerce.” For 10 points, name this New York structure that was the world's tallest building at its 1913 completion, a skyscraper designed by Cass Gilbert to be the headquarters of the namesake discount retail store.

answer: “{Benito Cereno}”

The final pages of this work, which are introduced by “His Majesty's Notary,” are written as a series of declarations and depositions.  In one scene in this work, a man whose ears once held wedges of gold is brought out in chains, but when the protagonist asks what Atufal did to deserve this, the man with the key around his neck falters.  Based on information taken from A Narrative of Voyages and Travels in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, a key moment in this text occurs when an attendant shaves his quaking master.  First published in Putnam's alongside five other stories including “The Lightning Rod Man” and “The Encantadas,” it ends with the main character discovering that the Senegalese Babo and his men have seized control of the title character's vessel, the San Dominick. For 10 points, name this work about Amasa Delano's discovery of a mutiny, a story by Herman Melville.

answer: {Dom Pedro} I of (or {Pedro IV} of Portugal)

During this man's rule, his army was shaken by the “Revolt of the Parakeets,” named for the green and yellow trim on the uniforms of the revolting battalion. He was also opposed by a movement called the Confederaton of the Equator led by Friar Caneca, who opposed his reforms and attempted to found a breakaway state. He first married Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of  and then wed Amelie de Beauharnais after her death, when he was forced to fight the Liberal War against his brother in order to secure his throne for his daughter Maria da Gloria. He's more famous for issuing the Grito do Ipiranga as regent with his sword drawn, after which he was declared emperor. For 10 points, name this son of John VI of Portugal, who became the first ruler of an independent Brazil.

answer: Andrei {Rublev}

Much of what we know of his inspiration comes in a biography of his mentor written by Epiphanius. Between 1905 and 1918 his most famous work underwent restoration, though the gold background was lost and the lone tree had to be painted anew. In good condition is his Harrowing of Hell, though the top of Christ's head is missing in his The Savior, one of his few works located in a museum.  Rather, it is such sites as the Dormition Church and Dormition Cathedral that house his frescoes, many of which he completed with the help of Theophanes the Greek. Solo credit is given for his Old Testament Trinity, initially housed in the cathedral of his master St. Sergius.  For 10 points, name this subject of an Andrei Tarkovsky film and 14th and 15th century Russian icon painter.

answer: {Folkways}

Its final chapter, which cites to Burckhardt's Renaissance to make a point about the definition of “success,” begins by comparing Native American and Samoan approaches to deceit during warfare and is entitled “Life Policy.”  Another section describes the history of the mimus and the marionette theater to argue that “amusements” “lack all progress” and need the constant control of educated judgment and will.  This work asserts that slavery originated with “ill feelings towards a member of an out group” but that it paradoxically taught members of society the value of work.  Chapter two defines certain entities and notes that they arose from recurrent needs that were unforeseen and went unnoticed for a long time.  First published in 1906, it advocated a study of society its author termed “ethology” and focused on the relationship between the titular non-coercive customs and their more binding analogues: Mores. For 10 points, identify this work by William Graham Sumner.

answer: {quark}

The potential energy between two heavy ones is Coulombic at short distances, but becomes linear, representing a constant attractive force, for a range of distances around a femtometer. The effect of pair creation of these particles allows chromoelectric flux tubes to break, with the pieces becoming independent jets. The heaviest known one weighs about 175 GeV and was discovered at Fermilab's Tevatron collider, and unlike lighter ones, it decays before it can form hadrons. They were called “aces” by George Zweig, who proposed them independently of Murray Gell-Mann. For 10 points, what is this type of subatomic particle, 3 of which make up a proton or neutron?

answer: Some {Prefer Nettles} or {Tade Kuu Mushi}

Early in this work, a salesman arrives with a copy of the Arabian Nights for his cousin, the protagonist, and a new greyhound for his nephew, the protagonist's son.  Another section describes a Madam's Yorkshire upbringing and the death of her brother in Canada, before the scene shifts to the boudoir of a Polish whore named Louise.  In Chapter 9 a young woman with black teeth performs the song “Snow,” which reminds the main character of the first time he “worshipped a woman,” a feeling he no longer has for his own wife. The next chapter sees the protagonist accompany his father-in-law and O-hisa to see Morning Glory Diary, one of many puppet plays attended over the course of this novel.  A letter from Takanatsu reveals that Hiroshi knows about his mother's infidelity with Aso and the coming dissolution of Misako and Kaname's marriage in, for 10 points, what work by Junichiro Tanizaki.

answer: {Kama} or {Kamadeva} (accept early buzz of {Ananga} or {Pradyumna} before they are mentioned.)

An alternate name for this figure is Dipaka, which means “little lamp.” In one story about him, during the month of Caitra, his remains were put in cuckoos and black insects among other things. In that story, as related in the Matsya Purana, he claims that krodha follows dvesa and that irsya destroys dhairya. In that same story he was accompanied by Madhu and is called to awaken another god from his meditation following the attacks of the demon Taraka. He is eventually reincarnated as Pradyumna, the son of Rukmini, after having been exposed to Madana, which made him “bodiless,” and gave him the epithet Ananga. His banner is marked by the large fish Makara and this deity sometimes rides a parrot. For 10 points, name this husband of Rati, the Hindu god of love.

answer: {Beyond} Good and {Evil} or {Jenseits von Gut und Bose}

This work identifies two types of genius: one that begets and one that is “happy to be impregnated.”  It also recounts the relationship between Kotzebue and his audience, before asserting that the Addresses to the German Nation amounted to dishonest flattery in Part 8, an exploration of “fatherlandishness.”  Another section cites the sweetness of “a Roman in the Arena” or the “Spaniard at the sight of… the bullfight” to assert that high culture is based on the spiritualization of cruelty.  This work, which asserts that “morality in Europe these days is the morality of herd animals,” contains such chapters as “We Scholars” and “The Free Spirit” and opens with a “Preface” that posits the question: “Suppose that truth is a woman?”   For 10 points, identify this work, subtitled “Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future,” a work Friedrich Nietzsche.

answer: “{Lapis Lazuli}”

In one section of this work, the speaker asserts that a certain commodity “cannot grow by an inch or ounce,” before moving on to discuss the “handiwork of Callimachus.”  The speaker, who had also previously asserted that “All things fall, and are built again,” later imagines a figure asking for “mournful melodies” and “delight[s] to imagine” a long legged bird, a “symbol of longevity,” flying over a trio still seated on the mountain and the sky.  The second section of this 56 line work reads, “All perform their tragic play, / There struts Hamlet, there is Lear, / That's Ophelia, that Cordelia,” while it begins with a stanza about “hysterical women” who criticize the poet's inefficacy and dread the coming of the “Aeroplane and Zeppelin.”  Composed to commemorate a birthday gift given to the poet by his friend, Harry Clifton, it depicts a set of “Chinamen” carved out of the title material.  For 10 points, identify this William Butler Yeats poem named for a rich blue stone.

answer: {Regulator}({s}) {Revolt} or Uprising etc.

It was precipitated by an assault on an officer named Edmund Fanning who was pulled down the stairs in his own home and by one's side refusal to attend a public meeting.  Although a proclamation against the taking of illegal fees was issued by Arthur Dobbs, the directive was ignored and the situation was further exacerbated by his successor's construction of a “palace” in New Bern.  Of the 14 captives tried at a special term of the Superior Court as a result of this event, whose leaders included such men as James Hunter, Rednap Howell, and Herman Husband, six were hanged, before the King agreed to pardon the rest.  Centered in and around the counties of Anson and Orange, it ended with Governor Tryon's victory at the Battle of Alamance, for 10 points, identify this 1771 uprising in colonial North Carolina.

answer: {porphyrins}

Dimeric arrays in which this molecule exists in zinc-bonded and free-base forms are capable of long-distance energy migration and have been used in artificial olfactory receptors.  Cationic manganese examples of these act as superoxide reductases.  One piece of evidence for the RNA world hypothesis is that bacteria and plants, but not humans, use glutamyl-tRNA in the C-5 pathway for the synthesis of the committed precursor of this family of compounds; in humans, glycine reacts with succinyl-CoA to form alpha-amino-beta-ketoadipate, which is decarboxylated to form the committed precursor D-aminolevulinate.  The addition of iron to one member of this family of compounds is catalyzed by ferrochelatase.  Defects in an early step in their biosynthesis can result in X-linked sideroblastic anemia.  For 10 points, name this family of chemicals with a metal-coordinating ring structure, examples of which include chlorophyll and heme.

answer: {String Quartet} [accept equivalents; prompt on “ {Quartet} ”]

Hindemith wrote one in E-flat major that stressed thematic material rather than contrapuntal procedure, while Milhaud wrote one during his residence in Rio de Janeiro that includes a slow movement in the style of a funeral march.  Borodin's second one contains a notable Nocturne and was written in D major.  Another one of these compositions features a coda where a high E over a tremolo simulates what its composer described as “the fatal whistling in my ear.”  That piece was subtitled From My Life and was the first of two by Smetana.  Of the 13 composed by Dvorak, his most famous was the Native American inspired “American” one, while a set of three of them, named for the Russian ambassador to the Hapsburg court, Andreas Razumovsky, was written by Beethoven.

Mutations in the SERPING1 gene product and other components of the complement pathway are a risk factor for diseases of this structure, as is the presence of reticular zinc-rich bodies.  Toxoplasmosis infection can cause stellate exudates in it.  Dichroism in this structure is thought to explain the phenomenon of Haidinger's brushes.  An elongated layer of S-shaped axons under this structure is called the fiber layer of Henle.  The accumulation of drusen and the vascularization of Bruch's membrane are symptoms of the “wet” form of a disease of this structure.  Zeaxanthin is one of two pigments that give it a yellow color, and a cone-rich pit within this structure is called the fovea.  For 10 points, name this part of the retina, whose degeneration causes a common type of blindness.

Autoimmune etiology for this disease is based on an association with HLA Cw6.  Calcipotriol and dithranol are largely outdated treatment modalities unlike Ingram's regimen which can cure up to 80% of cases.  Among the pathological types of this disease are guttate and pustular, and there can be an associated arthropathy explaining the use of TNF-alpha blockers in combating it.  However, the first line therapy is the use of PUVA or psoralens with ultraviolet A. Its typical manifestations can be seen on flexor surfaces, palms, with nail involvement, and the scalp where it is sometimes confused with seborrhoeic dermatitis.  For 10 points, name this condition characterized by erythematous plaques with silvery scales, a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin.
