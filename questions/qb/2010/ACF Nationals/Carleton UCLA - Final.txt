answer: {magnetic monopole} (prompt on {monopole}, do not accept {electric monopole})

The SLIM experiment at Chacaltaya in Bolivia is an attempt to discover intermediate-mass ones; another bound comes from a Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment at the South Pole. On Valentine's Day in 1982, a possible but unconfirmed signal of one was recorded by Blas Cabrera. JJ Thomson showed that a static configuration of one separated from an electric charge by some distance has a classical angular momentum along the line between them. Restricting this angular momentum to be a multiple of one-half h-bar leads to the Dirac quantization condition, which is one way to understand why they famously could explain the quantization of electric charge. Another explanation involves Dirac strings. For 10 points, name this theoretical object that produces a B field similar to the E field produced by a point charge.

answer: {Mrs. Warren's Profession}

This work's protagonist wants "a novel with a good detective story in it", and wants to avoid the "romance and beauty of life" as well as "love's young dream."  This declaration prompts her lover to leave her and vow to be like a brother to her, which he may indeed be, according to another character named Crofts.  In another section of this work the reader learns of the “Gospel of Art,” a philosophy espoused by an architect and central character. Another character's rejection is followed by the protagonist's decision to go to Chancery Lane to do actuary work at Honoria Fraser's chambers, ungratefully using the math education provided for by the profits of her mother's business.  For 10 points, name this work that includes the characters of Praed and Frank Gardner and turns on Vivie's realization that Kitty is a Madam, a play by George Bernard Shaw.

answer: {broken windows} theory

The article outlining this theory cited survey data by Elinor Ostrom as supporting the idea that resources must be devoted to supporting community needs. A 2008 paper by Keizer et al in Science reported six field experiments in support of it, though articles by Harcourt and Ludwig cited data from Housing and Urban Development relocation projects as evidence against it. It has also been criticized for neglecting to consider alternative causes such as abortion by Steven Leavitt. This theory was initially described in an Atlantic Monthly article by Wilson and Kelling, and  developed out of an experiment concerning abandoned vehicles in the Bronx and Palo Alto conducted by Zimbardo. Many attribute reduced crime in New York in the 1990s to the implementation of this theory by Rudy Giuliani. For 10 points, name this theory that decreasing disorder will reduce crime.

Earlier it is revealed that the man who counts the saucers was saved by his niece, who cut him down when he tried to commit suicide.  First published in 1933 and collected in its author's Winner Take Nothing, it ends with one of the characters stopping by a bodega to ward off insomnia; that section is preceded by a recitation of the Lord's Prayer with the use of the word “nada” sprinkled throughout.

The first of these objects was discovered in 1920, but was not classified until the 1970s. That object was Hidalgo. Recently, the first binary pair of these objects was discovered. It consists of Echidna and Typhon. Charles Kowal discovered the first of these objects, which was later reclassified after the discovery of ice-jets emanating from it. The unstable orbits of these bodies are caused by the perturbation of a nearby planet. These bodies are believed to originate in the Kuiper Belt and examples of them include Echeclus, Chariklo, and Chiron. They exhibit behavior that is in some ways a hybrid of asteroids and comets, hence their name. For 10 points, name these icy planetoids that orbit between Jupiter and Neptune, named after Greek mythological half-men half-horses.

At one point in this work, a character is praised for his short responses to questions. In another section of this work, which inspired Olympiodorus to author a namesake Scholia, its participants consider what it means to have honor. The title character of this work was well known for positing that even if something exists, that nothing could be known or communicated about it in his work On Non-being.

12 One compound containing this metal is used as a catalyst in both a reaction converting an alkene to a cis-vicinal diol and an improvement on that reaction using chiral quinine ligands; those reactions are dihydroxylations named for Upjohn and Sharpless. Kellenberger's solution, which contains this element, is used as a fixative in transmission electron microscopy, though this element is also useful as a lipid stain. Along with ruthenium, this metal is able to achieve a +8 oxidation state, and the aforementioned compound, a highly toxic and unusually volatile yellow solid which has been known to turn people's corneas black, sees this metal in that oxidation state as a tetroxide. For 10 points, name this densest element with atomic number 76 and symbol Os.

One individual commonly cited as a daughter of this figure was the spirit of Excuse, Prophasis, while a Corinthian nymph who was either the daughter or wife of this figure was Ephyra. This figure's daughter was the mother of Protogeneia, Thyia, and the king Hellen, and that daughter previously consulted the oracle at Themis with her husband, the last Bronze Age man, about how to repopulate the human race. This figure's agreement with his brother that the latter would inspect this figure's handiwork eventually resulted in that brother's theft of a fennel-stalk from heaven.

The Hickman group pioneered a cell-free system to study their development. Contactin-associated protein 2 localizes to these structures and is thought to organize Kv1.1 localization and, along with C-fibers, these sites are where Nav1.6 most frequently localizes. Features located proximal to these structures include lateral loops, transverse bands, and Schmidt-Lantermann cells. The sequestration of the sodium-potassium pump and voltage-gated channels to these sites ensures that little to no loss of membrane depolarization occurs between these sites. When these sites are absent, continuous conduction occurs; in their presence, saltatory conduction occurs. For 10 points, name these neuronal structures that consist of the gaps in myelin sheaths.

answer: the {anthropic} principle

One use of it has been to suggest that a large axion decay constant, naively ruled out due to its prediction of an overabundance of dark matter, is allowed due to a highly tuned initial angle. Hoyle's argument for the existence of a particular resonance of carbon-12 is often considered a use of this principle. In cosmology, it is the subject of a book by Barrow and Tipler. Its name was coined by Brandon Carter, and one prominent use is Stephen Weinberg's 1987 prediction of a small cosmological constant on the basis of galaxy formation. Its weak form is a tautological statement that the universe must be compatible with our knowledge that carbon-based life exists. For 10 points, what is this controversial principle which in one strong form relies on an ensemble of universes in which we live in a rare habitable region?
