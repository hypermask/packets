answer: {skulls}

Both Phillipe de Champaigne and Pieter Claesz were known for doing still lifes focused on this particular object. A detail of one on Mt. Golgotha was done by Fra Angelico and a teenage boy with an orange-feathered cap is seen in Frans Hals' portrait of a “Youth” with one. Francisco Zurbaran depicted St Francis looking at one of these objects, while another one of these was depicted “with calico roses”. A recent sculpture of one of these was titled For the Love of God, and a “Pyramid” of them forms the scene and title of a Paul Cezanne painting. One appears at the bottom of a painting depicting Georges de Selve and Jean de Dentville. For 10 points, name this object which was covered with diamonds by Damien Hirst, a distorted example of which appears in Holbein's The Ambassadors.

answer: Carl Maria von Weber

The finale to one opera by this man derives tunes from music to Gehe's Heinrich IV. In that opera two slaves recount their childhood in the duet “On the Banks of the Sweet Garonne” and mermaids frolic in the finale, “Oh, ‘tis pleasant.” He also included such objects as an enchanted golden cup containing infinite wine and a magical horn in that opera, whose title character saves the day by having Ruon and Reiza returned to the court of Charlemagne. In another opera by him the title character has two solos in the first act, including “Through the forests and meadows.” That title character loves the cousin of Anchen and by opera's end is forgiven by Prince Ottokar. His notable parts in that opera include the music of the Wolf's Glen scene and the “Hunter's Chorus.” For 10 points, name this composer of an opera about the king of fairies, Oberon, and an opera about the marksman Max, Der Freischutz.

answer: plasmons 

In 2005 Alu and Engheta proposed using gold loops to construct a sort of invisibility cloak based on these. The polariton type of these are attractive candidate carriers for proposed photonic circuits. The typical energy scale for these is tens of electronvolts as can be found by measuring the energy lost by electrons fired through thin films. Their characteristic frequencies define the transmission bandwidth of metals. A variety of these localized to surfaces was predicted in 1957 by Rufus Ritchie; the sensitivity of that type to variations in the dielectric constant is the basis of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. For 10 points, name these quasiparticles, quanta of collective vibrations of the electron gas in metals.

answer: {Rhenish} Symphony or Symphony {No.} 3 in E Flat Major

The third section of this work is a Romanza that features a melody initially presented by clarinets and is marked “not fast.”  Its reflective second theme is introduced by oboe and clarinet, while the second section, a scherzo, which features cellos, violas, and bassoons, incorporates a traditional “wine song” and was originally to have borne a title referring to the sun rising over a certain river.  This work, which ends with a brisk march depicting a country festival, was written during the composer's tenure as a conductor in Dusseldorf.  Its fourth and penultimate movement features a stately contrapuntal melody that was supposedly inspired by the composer's attendance at a ceremony marking the elevation of an archbishop at the Cologne Cathedral.  For 10 points, identify this work written in E flat major, a symphony by Robert Schumann.

answer: {mihrab}

Jean Sauvaget has attempted to trace the origin of it, using as evidence early Egyptian sources calling them “mujawwaf.” Archeologists' have found the earliest representation of it on an Umayyad coin found in Syria, while Creswell controversially places the earliest one at a site at Khassaki built by Al Mansur. The first one was built by al-Walid, while the Fath-al-Bari describes its original meaning as “a place of kings.” The one in the Mezquita of Cordoba is non-standard—Abd ar-Rahman was said to have built it imagining himself still in Damascus.  Originally described as a special room in the Quran, it marks the location of the Qibla. For 10 points, identify this portion of a mosque, literally meaning “niche,” that indicates the direction of Mecca and thus which way prayers should face.

answer: {May 4th} Movement

The city square named for this movement now contains a red spiral sculpture called “The Wind”.  Leaders of this movement include the editor of the revolutionary magazine La Jeunesse, and the author of “Storm in a Teacup” who began to write in the vernacular baihua style. One major grievance of this movement, a result of the Twenty-One Demands, was resolved at the Washington Naval Conference. This movement also saw the intelligentsia of their country embrace the philosophy of pragmatism and begin to doubt the historical accuracy of the Records of the Grand Historian, ideas promulgated by the “national scholar” Hu Shi.  Politically, its major goal was the restoration of the  province from  after World War I. For 10 points, name this student-led cultural movement that led to the birth of both the Nationalist and Communist parties in , and began on a certain date in 1919.

answer: {general equilibrium} theory [or GET; or {DGSE}, {dynamic generalized stochastic equilibrium}, accept {neo}-{Walrasian theory}; prompt on {neo}-{classical theory}; do not accept or prompt on “partial {equilibrium theory}” or “{equilibrium theory}”]

A relaxed set of postulates for this framework is the Mas-Colell axioms, which eliminate the need for transitivity. In systems governed by this model, the set of excess demand functions is not restricted by the usual rationality restrictions on individual demands in the economy, a result known as the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem. One argument for this theory considers an auction in which each agent calculates his demand for a good at every possible price and submits it to an auctioneer, from which a price in agreement with this theory will be computed. The production function usually used in this theory is due to Koopmans, although it was significantly refined by another economist in The Theory of Value. This theory's central tenet is that excess market demand always sums to zero. For 10 points, identify this theory of economics that claims that all markets and prices are always at a macroeconomic optimum.

answer: {keto}-{esters} [prompt on {esters} or {ketones} or {carbonyls}]

One way to synthesize carbonyls is to cause these chemicals to undergo a saponification, protonation, and heat decomposition to liberate carbon dioxide. The utility of these multi-coupling reagents stems from the fact that, of their four structural carbons, two belong to different electrophilic groups and two are nucleophiles for different groups, which allows selective bonding to all four. These compounds are the major products in the reaction of two compounds of the form R-C-O-O-R-prime under base catalysis. These may be understood generally as the result of attaching a carbonyl to the product of a reaction between an acid and an alcohol. For 10 points, name this class of compounds of which the aforementioned Claisen condensation produces beta- forms.

answer: Fermilab 

Observations at this site recently ruled out neutrino oscillation as an explanation for the LSND result; those data were acquired by an experimental group including Steve Brice and Richard Van de Water. The MINOS experiment is intended to study neutrino oscillations by sending a beam from its NUMI line to the Soudan mine 450 miles away; ARGONeut and MicroBoone are prototypes for a large neutrino detector to be installed at the DUSEL facility at the Homestake mine to work in conjunction with beams from this facility. Bison were introduced to this facility in 1969, with the current herd count at 45. Its Robert Rathbun Wilson Hall overlooks the ring which houses the DZero and CDF experiments, which jointly discovered the top quark in 1995.
