answer: {actinides} or {actinoids}

It is difficult to use the de Haas-van Alpen effect to determine Fermi surface parameters of compounds containing these substances, as the presence of upwards of 20 conduction electrons confounds analysis.  Consumption of these substances may be treated with a combination of penetate calcium disodium and siderophore analogues to minimize their bonding to endosteal bone surfaces and subsequent bone tumor formation. These substances are often isolated by reducing their tri- or tetra-fluorides at high temperatures in the presence of lithium or calcium.  A Mott transition within this group explains a switch from high-symmetry to low-symmetry crystal structures and from relatively localized to itinerant 5f electrons. For 10 points, name this series of elements that includes thorium and uranium and is found below the lanthanide series on the periodic table.

answer: {Henry Moore}

He turned to printmaking late in his career, producing more than 260 lithographs and etchings including the Elephant Skull and Sheep portfolios. His first major work had been the Hornton stone Mother and Child in the style of Masaccio finished about 15 years before the first of his “helmet sculptures” and 4 years before his first public commission, North Wind. A series of his post-war creations can be found in the U.S. including his Family Group and King and Queen, but it was another series of works, inspired by his viewing of a Mexican Chac Mool figure with which he was identified. Those works led to him, along with countrywoman Barbara Hepworth, becoming a leading proponent of Organic Abstractionism.  For 10 points, name this British sculpture known for his series of Recumbent and Reclining Figures.

answer: {Denmark Vesey}

According to Michael Johnson, the event associated with this man was actually instantiated by James Hamilton Jr., who sought to politically discredit his rival Thomas Bennett. This man's death was followed by the passage of a Seamen's Act that was declared unconstitutional. His emergence as a leader was predicted by a newspaper man, Edwin Holland, who described the Church, where he preached about the coming of a New Israelite Kingdom and served as “class leader,” as a nest of “Jacobins.” Earlier he secured his freedom with a winning East Bay Lottery ticket. He sought out blacksmiths to hammer out swords in secret and was aided by such figures as Peter Poyas, as well as a man who gave each of his followers a charm to protect them from musket balls.  That man, Gullah Jack, would also be executed for participating in a plot that was planned by this man for Bastille Day in 1822.  For 10 points, identify this man who conspired to lead namesake slave revolt in Charleston.

answer: {Waiting} for {Lefty}

One character in this work reminisces about visiting the Meuse-Argonne cemetery while discussing handwriting with Mr. Fayette.  The third section features a young couple dancing to a record before they collapse in each other's arms, while the fourth concludes with a revelation that Clayton once worked for the Bergman's on Columbus Circle and is the brother of a member of the Chorus.  In the first Act a mother laments that her child Betty has never seen a grapefruit; later Edna threatens to leave her husband for Bud Hass if he doesn't stand up to “the company.”  As it opens, the cigar smoking Harry Fatt notes that Roosevelt is now in office, in an attempt to discourage the agitated crowd on stage, they, in turn, call for the arrival of a title figure with the last name Costello.  For 10 points, identify this work about Joe Mitchell, Agate, and their fellow cab drivers going on strike, a play by Clifford Odets.

answer: Saint {Simeon} or {Simeon Stylites} or Saint {Simeon} the {Stylite} [prompt on the {Stylite}]

According to Theodoret's account of his life, he wore on his body a heavy iron chain and he bent down so that his forehead almost touched his feet.  Early on he lived in a cave, where he spent the entire period of Lent abstaining from food.  His similarly named son would go on to establish a monastery at what was later called “The Hill of Wonders.”  Women were generally not permitted beyond the double wall that was built near his “Mandra.”  Indeed, he refused to see his mother, St. Martha, until she passed away and her body was brought to him.  Celebrated by the Orthodox Church on September 1, his followers included Daniel, who lived for 33 years near Constantinople in the mode of this man, a Syrian who received visitors at the holy site he erected at Mount Teleanissae via a ladder.  For 10 points, identify this Christian saint who is named for the pillar on which he lived and preached.

answer: Intel x86 Architecture (or Intel x86 {CPUs} or Intel x86 {Framework}; prompt on "{Pentium}" or "{Intel Pentium}" before "{Celeron}")

Extensions to this to make it better meet the Popek-Goldberg requirements include the Vanderpool project.  A modern extension to this can run in both Long and Legacy modes.  By default it disables the A20 line when started, which helps avoid crashes when running in Protected rather than Real mode.  A successor to MMX called SSE added SIMD support to this system.  The IOPL bit is present on systems of this type that are IA-32 compatible, while flags present on all of them include the Overflow and Carry flags.  The company that standardized it attempted to depart from it with the Itanium project, and rivals to it include ARM and PowerPC.  The platform on which the Celeron was built, for 10 points, name this 32 bit architecture powering Intel Pentium processors, which is slowly being supplanted by x64.

answer: Salvador {Allende}

This leader seized upon previous legislation passed by the Christian Democrats to expropriate any estates over eighty hectares in size and later established local rationing boards that went by the acronym JAP.  His policies were opposed by such groups as Order and Freedom and Fatherland and Liberty, but enabled by the laissez-faire ethos of the “Schneider Doctrine,” which allowed his victory over Paper Manufacturer Jorge Alessandri to stand.  Disturbances during this man's time in office include the El Teniente Copper strike and the rebellion of a tank regiment near the capital.  His eventual successor replaced the loyal Carlos Prats as a member of this man's cabinet in August of 1973, one month before he would lead a coup against this man.  For 10 points, identify this leader of the Popular Unity Party, a Socialist president of Chile who was deposed by Augusto Pinochet.

answer: {Nazca} or {Nasca}

They fully exploited such indigenous sources of food and energy as the Huarango Tree, but were ultimately conquered by the Wari.  They produced a distinctive polychrome pottery and their settlements, which were located in the Chincha and Acari regions, were centered around underground irrigation systems called puquios.  First studied by Max Uhle at a place now called Ocucaje, their civilization practiced human sacrifice as evidenced by a series of extant preserved heads on ropes, as well as the altars found at the Great pyramid at their capital, Cahuachi.  Their greatest creations still exist and most can now be found in the Ingenio Valley.  For 10 points, identify these ancient people of Peru that preceded the Inca and are known for their namesake “lines” that are visible from the air.

answer: {Newton's} constant [or "{G Newton}" or the universal {gravitational} constant or {big G}]

Shapiro and collaborators showed that radar-echo time delay measurements between planets constrain it to change by no more than a part in 10 billion per year. Dirac had suggested, in some numerology known as the “large numbers hypothesis,” that it decreases over time. In string theory, the effective value is inversely proportional to the volume of the compactification manifold. In a system of units with h-bar and c set to 1, it is simply one over the Planck mass squared. Its value is 6.67 times 10 to the minus 8 cubic centimeters per gram second-squared. It was first measured, using a torsion balance, by Henry Cavendish. For 10 points, what is this constant, which multiplies the masses of two objects divided by the square of their separation to give a universal force between them?

answer: {Thomas Hart Benton}

Though known for his canvases he did create numerous lithographs, including Letter From Overseas and Wreck of the 97.  For his oils he built detailed maquettes, or clay models, but he only did so after abandoning the Synchromist style of his former schoolmate Stanton Macdonald-Wright.  Controversy surrounded the red nail polish and stark nudity of the titular woman in his Susannah and the Elders and the leering old farmer in his Persephone. It was for his cycles of paintings that he was celebrated, such as his war series Year in Peril or his group of panels The Arts of Life in America.  More popular were his group of Indiana Murals and his Social History of Missouri.  For 10 points, name this American Regionalist painter, a one-time teacher of Jackson Pollock and namesake and great nephew of a 19th-century Missouri senator nicknamed “Old Bullion.”

answer: {poliovirus} (do not accept {poliomyelitis})

Its 3A protein depletes tumor necrosis factor receptor expression on the cell membrane of its host, while its 3C protein cleaves TATA-binding protein to shut off host RNA synthesis.  Reference strains of this pathogen include Mahoney and MEF-1, and the Nomoto group's development of the TgPVR mouse created the first non-primate model organism system for studying it.  SV40 was first identified in co-culturation with this pathogen in monkey kidney cells, and the first discovery of an internal ribosomal entry sequence occurred in this picornavirus's genome.  A small fraction of infections with this enterovirus result in infection of anterior horn motor neurons, which causes spinal paralysis.  For 10 points, name this small RNA virus against which vaccines were developed by Sabin and Salk.

answer: The {Italian} (or The {Confessional} of the {Black Penitents})

This novel's third and final section begins with two central characters and their guide encountering a villa ruined by an earthquake and ends with Paulo repeatedly remarking “Oh, happy days!”  The hero encounters the heroine in this novel's first line and helps her with her guardian Miss Bianchi, who is the first character to die. Among the last to die is Nicola, who is poisoned. Its hero is ultimately freed from the Inquisition and the rest of the denouement sees the verification of the heroine's identity as the daughter of the Countess Olivia. This allows for the Marchese's approval of a marriage that had been opposed throughout the novel by the evil Marchesa and her confessor. For 10 points, Vivaldi and Ellena end up together despite the actions of the villain and title character Schedoni in what Anne Radcliffe novel?

answer: {Phoenix Park Murders} (accept equivalents, {e.g. killings}, {stabbings}, as {long} as {Phoenix Park} is mentioned)

Matthias Brady was charged with threatening the jury in the trial of those accused of partaking in this event, and some of those who partook in it killed one of the jurors, Denis Field. On his way to South Africa the leader of the men involved in this incident was shot and killed. The conspirators were largely undone by the testimony of Michael Kavanagh who became an informant along with their leader, James Carey. As a result of it the advances gained four days earlier by the Kilmainham treaty would be delayed for the next few decades. The victims were on their way to Viceregal Lodge in the namesake location before being set upon by members of a group known as the Invincibles. For 10 points, name this incident in which Thomas Burke and Lord Frederick Cavendish were stabbed to death in 1882 in Dublin.

answer: {Dialogues} Concerning Natural {Religion}

Part 10 asserts that Epicurus' “old questions are yet unanswered,” while Part 7 posits a planet wholly inhabited by spiders.  In addition to citing Herbert of Cherbury's argument for the universal consent of mankind, another section references an article by Fontenelle to make the argument that “a skillful algebraist” would conclude that it is “necessity” rather than chance that explains why the products of 9 are composed of either 9 or a lesser product of 9.  J.G. Hamann notably translated this work, which is composed of 12 parts and articulated the ideas of Samuel Clarke into Gernan for Kant.  Published in 1779 and based in part on Cicero's The Nature of the Gods, it presents a series of discussions centered on Demea's and Philo's arguments against Cleanthes' deployment of “the argument from design.”  For 10 points, identify this exploration of the existence of God, a work by David Hume.

answer: {pulsar}

Recently it has been proposed that they may be the source of high-energy cosmic ray positrons observed by the Pamela, ATIC, and Fermi-LAT experiments, which would require nearby ones like B0656+14 or Geminga. The first extrasolar planets to be discovered, in 1992, were found orbiting one in the Virgo constellation. They typically have magnetic fields of order a trillion gauss. A very young one, produced during the SN 1054 supernova, had an initial rotational energy of around 10 to the 50 ergs and lies at the center of the Crab Nebula. The first observation of one was made at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1967, by Jocelyn Bell and Antony Hewish. For 10 points, what are these rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit regular bursts of radiation?
