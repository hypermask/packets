answer: {Max Schmitt} in a {Single Scull} or The {Champion Single Sculls}

On the brow at the hill on the right of this painting was the real-life mansion home of Samuel Breck.  Art historian Martin Berger argues that this painting's subject allowed the artist to assert his masculinity and it was the first in a series of nearly 30 paintings on the same subject the artist would complete over the next four years.  Many of them had identifiable landmarks, such as those in this painting – the Girard Avenue Bridge and the Railroad Connection Bridge.  The artist depicts himself moving away in the background, and in the foreground is the titular subject who was a practicing lawyer and childhood friend of the artist.  Commemorating an event of October 5, 1870 specifically the Schuylkill [skoo-kill] River Navy Regatta, for 10 points, name this painting of the titular oarsman by Thomas Eakins.

answer: {Gao} Xingjian

In one work by this author, an older couple named Anne and Bernard drag the middle aged writer Daniel and his attractive younger girlfriend into their domestic struggle.  In another work, set during a dream, a train journey forces a nameless traveler to face the evils of the world as represented by the archetypal Tramp, Thug, and Master.  Both of those plays, Weekend Quartet and Nocturnal Wanderer, illustrate what this author refers to as “theatricality,” a reaction against the “revolutionary realism” that dominated his homeland's literary scene at the time.  This author of such short stories as “The Temple” and “Buying a Fishing Rod for My Father,” also wrote a work based on the life of Huineng entitled Snow in August.  Still another work follows a narrator who seems to change identities as he/she journeys from Sichuan Province to the fabled Lingshan.  For 10 points, identify this author of Soul Mountain.

answer: {Clausius Clapeyron} equation

The “advantage” named for this relation describes the utility of lightly loaded columns in achieving good separation with relatively low retention volumes.  It can be used to find the slopes of individual reactions within Schreinemaker's bundles.  One assumption used to derive this equation is that the difference in volume between two phases can be approximated by the volume of an ideal gas, and this equation describes a Carnot cycle across a phase transition.  An analogue of the more empirical Antoine equation, this equation can be used to find the heat of vaporization.  Its theoretical justification is that the change in Gibbs free energy along the coexistence curve is zero.  For 10 points, name this doubly eponymous equation that relates the vapor pressure of a liquid to its temperature.

The character of Varrius first appears in Act IV, around the same time the Provost enters with the head of a dead pirate.  Earlier in the play, an exchange about what sort of apparel fits a thief takes place between the executioner, Abhorson, and the imprisoned clown, Pompey.  A subplot focuses on Frederick's sister, who is introduced listening to the song “Take, O take those lips away,” and pines for a lover who abandoned her.  The heroine is introduced during a discussion with Francisca that is interrupted by Lucio who informs her that a new Lord now governs Vienna.

answer: {Sedna}

In some descriptions, the right eye of this deity is replaced with a mass of thick, black hair or a blob of excrement representing the sins of man.  This deity punishes women who sew too frequently in the winter or who are dirty. Her realm is a limbo-like place where men's souls wait to travel to the Land of the Moon; it features ever-turning wheels of ice and is known as Adlivun. This deity can cause great famine by locking up all animals hunted for food, and this famine can only be stopped by traveling to this deity's home and combing her hair. This goddess's ravenous hunger as a child once caused her to eat her father's arm while he was sleeping, causing him to try to drown her.  During this attempt, he cut off her fingers, which fell into the sea to create the animals with which she is associated. For 10 points, name this Inuit goddess of whales, seals and other aquatic mammals.

answer: {green fluorescent} protein [accept {GFP}]

Jim Hasseloff and colleagues discovered an 84-nt cryptic intron in this protein's cDNA sequence, making codon alteration a necessary step in this protein's expression in Arabidopsis. Well-characterized mutations of this protein include a serine-to-threonine mutation at position 65 described by Roger Heim, which can be combined with a phenylalanine-to-leucine mutation at position 64 to generate a super-ecliptic pH-sensitive variant of this molecule. The structure of this molecule consists of a beta barrel, and its maturation involves modification of a serine-tyrosine-glycine tripeptide that makes up its chromophore. In 2008, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien were awarded the Chemistry Nobel for their work with this molecule, whose major emission peak occurs at 509 nanometers. First isolated from the Aequoria victoria jellyfish, for 10 points, name this molecule often used as a biological marker that when exposed to blue light, emits its namesake colored light.

answer: “The {Bronze Horseman}” or “{Medni Vsadnik}”

This work's introduction beseeches its addressee to “vaunt thy splendor” and describes a bachelor's hour of feasting and the “playing fields of Mars.”  It includes a footnote that corrects the misrepresentations made in an earlier depiction of the same event by Mickiewicz.  The recurring images in this work include a willow that marks the house of a widow and her daughter, as well as “two lions” constantly at guard.  The main character who is described as “attacked” by “hideous thoughts” and dreams of seeing his beloved Parasha again, loses his home after a great flood levels the city.  Divided into three parts, it was inspired by the author's admiration for an object created by Etienne Maurice Falconet and centers on a man named Yevegeny, whose curse brings the statue of a Russian ruler to life.

This battle was preceded by a sack of Divodurum two months earlier, and Lupus, the Bishop of Troyes, saved that city from destruction by appeal to the invading army. Two years after this clash, the losing force was decimated again at the Battle of Nedao. Its initial stages saw the army of king Sangiban forced to support the winning side. An account of this battle by Jordanes says that many were forced to drink their own blood at a brook. Soon after its conclusion, the losing commander met with the pope, after he'd earlier been invited to take Honoria as his bride. This battle saw forces under Valamir and others beaten back by a coalition of Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic troops of Theodoric. For 10 points, name this major victory for the Western Roman Empire against the invading Huns in 451 C.E., which took place on an eponymous plain.

Delayed load scheduling is a variant on the Sethi-Ullman algorithm frequently used in simple implementations of one of their stages.  One of these called ROSE produces a higher level output than usual, and up to three different systems are employed in the Canadian Cross version of one of these.  Some of these perform strength reduction and rematerialization, the latter of which reduce calls to memory.  Simpler ones execute in a single pass, and common optimizations in them include loop unrolling.  Their traditional first step outputs a series of identifiers such as "Keyword" or "Integer" that are called tokens; that is the lexical analysis step.  Self-hosting ones of these are called bootstrappers.  Typically not performed by interpreted languages like Perl, Java uses a just-in-time one.  For 10 points, name this operation that turns source code into a machine readable target language.

answer: {strain}

Less common ways of formulating this tensor-field quantity include one named after either Euler or Almansi which references the system's final configuration. The Green-Lagrangian tensor of this quantity is equal to one-half the difference of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor and the identity, a formulation equal to one-half the difference of the product of the deformation gradient times its transpose and the identity. A yield surface maps out the values of this beyond which a material suffers plastic, rather than merely elastic, deformation. Young's modulus measures the stiffness of a material by computing the ratio of stress to this quantity. For 10 points, what is this dimensionless measure of the deformation of a body, given in uniaxial form by the change in length divided by the original length?
