answer: {Simon} de {Montfort}, {6th} Earl of {Leicester}

The papal legate Ottobon urged moderation in dealing with the supporters of this man, whose death led to those supporters pillaging the countryside from strongholds at places like Axholme and Ely. He had first consolidated his power after using his brightly decorated litter as a trap in battle and by raising a fleet in the Cinque Ports.  He would then briefly establish co-rule with the Bishop of Chichester and the Earl of Gloucester. However, he was weakened the next year by the machinations of Richard de Clare and the negative views of his alliance with Llewellyn. His end came when his son was defeated at Kenilworth and when his own forces fell the next day at Evesham. For 10 points, name this French-English nobleman who briefly ruled England after the Barons' War of 1263

answer: {ferroelectricity} (accept word forms)

Slim-loop hysteresis and optical isotropy are observed in the relaxor type of materials exhibiting this property.  The presence of antiphase boundaries in materials with this property appears to contribute to fatigue-free behavior.  This property is not observed in quartz, though perovskite crystals, such as barium titanate. Materials exhibiting this property, such as PZT, are used to build RAM devices that use relatively little power to write and store data. Like a similarly named magnetic property, this property is not observed above the Curie temperature.  For 10 points, name this property, in which the application of an external electric field causes a material to experience permanent electric polarization.

answer: {Dirty Hands} or {Les Mains Sales}

A key revelation in this work involves a dispute over the establishment of a committee with six votes.  At one point the protagonist recalls receiving poisoned chocolates from a man named Dresch while he is in jail.  In another scene we are introduced to two men, George and Slick, who walk around a summer house with machine guns and ogle the main character's upper-class wife, Jessica.  The seventh and final act ends with the protagonist yelling, “Unsalvageable,” as he leaves his one-time comrade Olga behind and prepares to be executed by the revolutionary party he once killed for.  For 10 points, identify this play, centering on the idealistic Hugo's struggle over the assassination of the pragmatic Hoederer, a work by Jean Paul Sartre.

answer: Phineas Taylor {Barnum}

He once went to jail due to a libel suit stemming from his Herald of Freedom newspaper, while donations to Tufts University were part of his so-called “profitable philanthropy.”  Twice elected to the Connecticut State Senate, his initial fortune was built on the success of an establishment in New York that he'd purchased from John Scudder.  He turned a collection of articles he wrote for the New York Weekly Mercury debunking frauds in history into the book Humbugs of the World and went on a European Tour with “General Tom Thumb.”  In addition he founded the American Museum which housed the Siamese twins Chang and Eng.  For 10 points, name this creator of the “Greatest Show on Earth” who entered into a partnership with James A. Bailey.

answer: {Surrender} of {Breda} (or {Surrender} at {Breda} or The {Lances} or Las {Lanzas})

The central scene in this painting relied heavily on an emblem in Andrea Alciati's Liber Eblemata, a popular book of the time, according to Jonathan Brown, an expert on the artist.  Brown also recently confirmed the attribution of the artist's Portrait of a Man, featuring a man who reappears at the far right of this canvas. It remains the most famous of 12 scenes painted for the Hall of Realms in a new state palace at the time.  Two clusters of figures dominate the space, and among those on the left we see the head of a horse peeking out over the shoulder of a man in bright white, which is contrasted with the hind quarters of the same horse standing out on the right. The center focuses on an exchange of keys between two men, Justin of Nassau and the opposing general, Ambrogio Spinola.   For 10 points, name this painting depicting the 1625 Dutch capitulation at the titular fortress, a work by Diego Velazquez.

answer: {Patriotic Gore}

One of the first works to treat the writings of Kate Stone and Charlotte Forten, its penultimate chapter cites Leon Edel's biographies to argue that such Henry James stories as “The Story of a Year” and “A Most Extraordinary Case” tie together sexual incapacity with the incapacity to serve one's country. That same section then turns to discuss the novels Playing the Mischief and Honest John Vane before declaring John W. De Forest to be the first author to deal seriously with this book's subject.  Though it devotes a number of pages to situate the work of John Pendleton Kennedy in relation to the “Myth of the Old South,” the most interesting chapter extols the merits of Grant's Autobiography.  Published in 1962, its title comes from James Ryder Randal's “Maryland, My Maryland.”  For 10 points, identify this collection of “Studies in the Literature of the Civil War,” a work by Edmund Wilson.

answer: The {Closing} of the American {Mind}: {How} Higher {Education has Failed Democracy} and {Impoverished} the {Souls} of {Today's Students}

This work analyzes a passage from Max Weber's Science as Vocation to prove a larger point about reason's failure to establish “values.”  In another section, it posits that “our desire for conflict reduction” explains the popularity of the word “dialectic” and contributes to “ignorance.”  It argues that Fromm's Escape from Freedom is “just Dale Carnegie with a bit of middle-European cultural whipped cream on top” in part two, “Nihilism American Style.”  This work traces the development of “relativism” and “tolerance” and advocates a return to the study of classical texts.  The Foreword, which notes that due to the prevalence of public opinion, the university is no longer an oasis of independent thought, was written by its author's friend, Saul Bellow.  For 10 points, identify this book about the paradoxical failure of higher education's embrace of “openness'” in a democratic society, a work by Allan Bloom.

answer: 21 {cm} line of hydrogen [accept {hydrogen line} or {HI line} or {1420 MHz} before “{wavelength}”]

The Murchison Widefield Array will detect the redshifted relic of this radiation from the reionization epoch, as will a namesake telescope in Xinjiang formerly called the Primeval Structure Telescope. It offers a rare chance to probe the “cosmic dark ages” between recombination and reionization. The Pioneer plaque shows a schematic of the transition responsible for it, and indicates that the Pioneer probe's height is approximately eight times this wavelength. It was first detected using a horn antenna at Lyman Lab at Harvard in 1951 by Ewen and Purcell. It is about three hundred thousand times the wavelength of the hydrogen-alpha line. For 10 points, what is this wavelength of microwave radiation, originating from a transition between two hyperfine levels of the hydrogen atom?

answer: {spontaneous} symmetry {breaking} [prompt on “{symmetry breaking}”]

In two spacetime dimensions, this effect never truly happens, being prohibited by strong quantum fluctuations as shown by Coleman, Mermin, and Wagner. Antiferromagnets exhibit this phenomenon for both time reversal and translations. Magnetization of the Ising model below a critical temperature is another example, as is superfluidity. Elitzur showed that for gauge theories it does not happen, although the Higgs mechanism provides a close analogue. This phenomenon is the basis of Landau's theory of second-order phase transitions. It leads to a gapless excitation, or Nambu-Goldstone boson. For 10 points, what is this phenomenon in which microscopic physics is invariant under a given symmetry but the ground state is not?

answer: {Stockholm Bloodbath} or {Stockholm Massacre} (or {Stockholms blodbad} or {det stockholmske blodbad})

This event was revenge for an incident three years prior in which one man's castle was destroyed brick by brick after the defeat of the army of his uncle Joakim. One of the spectators, a merchant named Hass, was killed for crying and of the eighteen men initially named for death only six were killed. It occurred after the surrender of the forces of Dame Christina two months earlier to a land force under the command of Otto Krumpen. Ultimately, it was targeted at the followers of a man who had taken a cannonball to the knee and died ten months earlier at Bogesund. Possibly planned by the king's minister Didrik Slagheck, it was directly caused by the vengeance sought by Erik Trolle. As a result 94 people were killed over three days by Jorgen Hellmuth. For 10 points, name this event perpetrated on supporters of Sten Sture on the orders of Denmark's Christian II in 1520 in the namesake Swedish city.
