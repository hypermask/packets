answer: The {Sense} of {Beauty}

It uses the example of a cloud that looks like a whale in chapter 28, “Values of types and values of examples,” to demonstrate the impact of extrinsic associations.  This work, which discusses Xenophon's veneration of a horse's legs, later considers the impact of rarity and the influence of “cost as an element of effect.”  It concludes by stating that its subject is an affection of the soul that is “of all things what least calls for explanation,” while this work's “Introduction” traces the connection between divinity and something so perfect that it provides pleasure.  Divided into sections titled “Form,” “Expression,” and “Materials,” it includes numerous examples from poetry and painting and its author's exploration of the title concept was expanded in the subsequent volume The Life of Reason.  For 10 points, identify this treatise, subtitled “Being the Outlines of an Aesthetic Theory,” a work George Santayana.

answer: {Adowa} or {Adwa}

This encounter was preceded by a clash at a garrison in Saati now known as the Dogali Massacre.  One side relied on their sinq, a type of campaign ration, and the establishment of gibbir, or feeding posts along the road.  The other side, which was supported by a large number of Askari troops, had previously retreated and been besieged for 45 days when it was prompted into action by a telegram from Premier Crispi.  However, in searching for the high ground great holes opened in the European lines and waves upon waves of men attacked.  Instantiated by a dispute over the 1889 Treaty of Wichale, it ended with Ras Makonnen's men overwhelming Orestes Baratieri's army.  For 10 points, identify this 1896 victory for Menelik II's forces that ensured Italian recognition of Ethiopia's independence.

answer: {nematic liquid crystal} [prompt on “{liquid crystal}”]

Oganesyan, Fradkin and Kivelson showed that this phase can arise among electrons in materials near a quantum critical point, possibly due to a Pomeranchuk instability. X-ray scattering in this type of phase reveals diffuse spots or diffuse rings that become quasi-Bragg peaks if it is cooled and enters a smectic phase. The order parameter for this phase is a traceless symmetric tensor, which becomes nonzero after a first-order phase transition from an isotropic phase, indicating breaking of rotational symmetry. It is characterized by typically rod-shaped particles with long-range orientational but not translational order, and named from a Greek word meaning “thread.” For 10 points, what is this ordered phase of matter, a twisted form of which is often used in digital LCD displays?

answer: {anterograde amnesia} (prompt on “{amnesia}”)

The limits of this state were documented in papers by Hirst and Volpe. The fact that it can be induced by the drug midazolam has been used by cognitive psychologists to study it in the lab. One attempt to explain these effects is via a computational binding model, one example of which is Reder's source activation confusion model.  Squire has used dissociations in its effect on implicit and explicit processes to argue for multiple systems. Lacking thiamin can lead to Korsakoff's syndrome, which can result in damange to the dienchephalon, which can also result in this. Caused by damage to the medial temporal lobe, or specifically, the hippocampus, its most famous sufferer was the patient H.M. FTP identify this psychological condition in which the brain is unable to form new long term memories.

answer: {sublimation} (accept word forms)

The formation of straight gallium nitride nanorods in the presence of ammonium relies upon this phenomenon, and one method of obtaining a heat transfer coefficient involves analyzing this process in naphthalene.  In addition to oxidation, this process limits the utility of arsenic as a doping agent in low-resistivity crystal growth.  When this technique is used in classroom purifications of caffeine, it is followed by the use of a cold finger to permit the collection of caffeine as it condenses.  The enthalpy of this can be determined by adding the enthalpies of vaporization and fusion.  For 10 points, name this phase transition in which a solid changes directly into a gas without becoming a liquid.

answer: {ozonolysis}

5,6-secosterol is a signature product of this reaction within atherosclerotic plaque.  Scavenger compounds like 2-butanol increase the yield of secondary organic aerosols when pinene is subjected to this reaction.  In this reaction, which is a series of three reversible 1,3-dipolar addition reactions, one of the more stable intermediates involves the reversion of a cyclic compound to a carbonyl and a carbonyl oxide, the latter of which is sometimes called the Criegee intermediate.  This reaction catalyzes the opposite conversion of the Wittig reaction, and harsher alternatives to this reaction involve the use of osmium tetroxide or permanganate.  For 10 points, name this reaction, a useful tool in locating double bonds in organic molecules, in which alkenes or alkynes are converted to carbonyl compounds by a triatomic allotrope of oxygen.

answer: {centromeres} (kinetochore is not acceptable at any point)

Mallik and Henikoff have posited the evolution of these structures from two-micron STB elements. These items are unable to self-associate properly in the absence of functional ESCO2, a condition known as Robert's syndrome. A common type of yeast vector combines this with an autonomous replicating sequence.  Shugoshin prevents the release of cohesin from these elements, and Cse4 is a H3 variant that loads at this site.  “Point” ones may bind only a single nucleosome and may be as small as 125 base pairs, but mammalian ones are much larger and contain repetitive alpha satellite DNA.  This DNA element is bound by Bub and Mad proteins during cell division.

answer: Election of 1892

Michigan Democrats passed the “Miner Law” before this election to split the state's traditionally Republican vote.  William Whitney unsuccessfully pushed for making former Republican and “Sisyphus of the Wabash” Isaac Gray the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, and one ticket in this campaign featured both a former Union and Confederate General. The latter was Vice Presidential candidate James Field who ran with a man who published A Call to Action in this year.  That faction put forth the Omaha Platform calling for a graduated income tax and a $50 per capita circulating medium.  Wyoming's recent entrance into the Union made it the first presidential contest in which women could vote, and the incumbent was hurt by the newly-passed McKinley Tariff. Meanwhile four states were won by a ticket headed by James Weaver of the Populist Party.  For 10 points, name this election in which Benjamin Harrison was defeated by Grover Cleveland.
