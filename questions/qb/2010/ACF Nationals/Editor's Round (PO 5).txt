answer: {Galois theory}

The Langlands program in mathematics relates to the attempt to understand this as applied to the algebraic closure of the rational numbers. For the polynomial x to the fourth plus three x squared plus five, it associates the dihedral group of order 8. It involves eponymous groups of automorphisms of a field that preserve a given subfield. The fundamental theorem of this subject establishes a one-to-one correspondence between subgroups of its namesake group and intermediate fields of a field extension. Although its most famous result was proved earlier by Abel, the establishment of this field led to a deeper understanding of the insolubility of the quintic equation by radicals. For 10 points, what is this branch of mathematics named for a French mathematician who was killed in a duel at age 20?

answer: An {Economic Interpretation} of the {Constitution} of the {United States}

This book opens by claiming that three groups – one marked by the absence of hypotheses, the Teutonic school, and the Bancroft school – are the three schools of historical research. Its diminishing impact was noted by Ellen Nore, the biographer of its author, and started primarily after Forrest Macdonald's devastating takedown of its research. A late chapter looks at the “Political Doctrines” of the men this book targets, and the penultimate chapter examines the “Popular Vote” on the titular item. The final chapter includes a long analysis of John Marshall's Life of Washington and this book also contains a detailed catalog of the public securities and land holdings of a group of 18th-century Americans. For 10 points, name this book which argued that the Founding Fathers were only interested in preserving their wealth in drafting the titular document, a 1913 monograph by Charles Beard.

answer: {altruism} or {altruistic} behavior

A paper by Andreoni and Miller used simulations and lab experiments to parameterize it using a revealed preference framework. Dale Miller wrote an article in American Psychologist arguing that to deny it leads to a tautology.  The competitive form of  it was introduced by Gilbert Roberts, who explained it by the handicap principle and signaling benefits. Daniel Batson tackled the question of this behavior, which he links in a namesake hypothesis with empathy. Pitirim Sorokin wrote a 1950 study about this type of love, subtitled as "a Study of American Good Neighbors." In a book subtitled "Toward a Social Psychological Answer," Along with fatalistic, anomic, and egoistic – it was identified by Emile Durkheim as one type of suicide. For 10 points, name this type of behavior in which agents account for benefits to people other than themselves.

answer: The {Autobiography} of an {Ex}-{Colored} Man

This work recounts an encounter with a man who supports Cuban independence by working as a cigar roller in Jacksonville.  The protagonist ends up playing Mendelssohn's “Wedding March” at a club that hosts lots of slumming visitors; this is where he meets “my millionaire” and witnesses the murder of a widow who bought him a drink.  Though he grows up in Connecticut, the protagonist attends school in Atlanta, but after seeing a man being burned at the stake decides to leave Georgia for good.  The protagonist later recognizes his childhood friend “Shiny” walking in New York and resolves to tell his new fiancé the truth.  Its author, who would revisit the same theme in 1933's Along this Way, based this work on the life of his friend and law partner Judson D. Wetmore, who succeeded in graduating from Michigan Law by “passing.” For 10 points, name this novel about a black man who lives as a white man, a work by James Weldon Johnson.

answer: {Fountain} of the {Four Rivers} (or {Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi})

Its major portions were completed by a select group of the artist's pupils, including Antonio Raggi and Claude Poussin.  Its building was highly unpopular due to the new bread tax instituted to finance its construction.  The artist himself was responsible for the images at the center, which were carved in situ, and include a horse and a palm tree.  Another pupil, Baratta, was responsible for the bearded black man who sits on a pile of coins and has his arm upraised, a gesture theorized to be an insult to the design of the neighboring church of Sant'Agnese by Borromini.  It is also populated by several types of animals, including a few lions and the dove at the top representing the Pamphili family of its patron, Innocent X.  For 10 points, name this structure in the Piazza Navona of Rome that was designed by Bernini and includes personifications of the Rio de la Plata and the Ganges.

In one section, the author cites Jose de Acosta's work on Peru, to highlight the infancy of the title concept.  In another part, the author explores the tension inherent in the rational adoption of “prerogative.”  The author quotes extensively throughout from The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity by Richard Hooker, particularly in the chapter, “On the State of Nature.”  This work attempted to prove that Adam had not, either by donation from God or by right of fatherhood, any natural authority over his children, and posited a theory of property based on improvement in an attempt to justify the legitimacy of the Glorious Revolution.  Published anonymously in 1690, [*] they address the true extent of a civil society and refute “the false principles and foundation” of the Patriarcha, a work by Sir Robert Filmer. For 10 point, identify this pair of essays by John Locke.

answer: {Berlin Air Lift} [or {Berlin Blockade}; accept {Operation Vittles} before mentioned]

Roger Gene Miller's history of this event details the complex block and ladder system used during it that initially gave low priority to Yorks.  Jake Schuffert created popular uncensored cartoons for the Task Force Times, a paper written for members of this operation.  It was preceded by the Gatow Disaster, and coal was a key component of its so-called “Easter Parade.”  One commander of this operation, sometimes known as “Willie the Whip,” had earlier made journeys across the Hump in Asia more efficient.  Gail Halvorsen became known as The Chocolate Uncle during this event, which was supported by Ernst Reuter. Officially designated as Operation Vittles, it was overseen by “Tonnage” Tunner, but the man most responsible for it was Lucius D. Clay.  For 10 points, name this operation that relieved residents of a city blockaded by the Soviets following World War II.

The second act features the symbolic vision of a goldfinch being captured and killed by a hawk, that scene is preceded by an episode in which the protagonist's footman pretends to be a Latin instructor from Coruna in order to gain access to his master's love.  When a rival suitor takes the green ribbon from a railing, it leads to an unsolicited marriage proposal for the heroine, whose beauty had earlier captivated the hero at the Feria.   Later, even though the title hero saves his rival from being gored by a bull in Medina, Rodrigo still ambushes him and shoots him to death.  Its author adapted portions of La Celestina in this work's depiction of the witch Fabia, whose machinations fail to bring Ines and the noble Alonso together.  For 10 points, identify this work about a warrior from a Castilian city, a play by Lope de Vega.

answer: {HOMO} or {highest occupied} molecular orbital

In zeolite pores, a confinement effect that acts primarily upon this entity reduces the gap between it and its counterpart.  The ionization potential of a closed-shell system may be determined by ascertaining the negative of its energy, a relationship described by Koopman's theorem. Walsh's rule predicts that molecular structures are predicated on the stability of these, while in ring-opening electrocyclic reactions, their symmetry directs the symmetry of the newly formed p-orbitals.  Lewis bases have a lone pair of electrons in this region, and the photochemical induction of cycloaddition of ethylene is activated by excitement of a pi electron that migrates to enter a new one of these. The Diels-Alder reaction involves interaction between this orbital of the diene and the opposite orbital of the dienophile.  For 10 points, name this frontier orbital that contains at least one electron.

answer: On {Hearing} the First {Cuckoo} in {Spring}

It opens with a slow three bar sequence that is eventually joined by a second melody for first violins based on a folk song that was brought to the composer's attention by Percy Grainger and named “In Ola Valley.”  The first melodic theme consists of a sequence of phrases written for strings and oboe that is played once and then softly repeated as if the instruments are engaged in an exchange.  This work, whose composition was preceded by A Song of the High Hills, was completed in the same year as its companion piece Summer Night on the River.  A tone poem, which was first performed in Leipzig in 1913, it concludes with a clarinet mimicking the calls of the title creature.  For 10 points, identify this musical sketch that depicts a bird stirring after the long winter, a work by Frederick Delius.

answer: {Spiritual Exercises} [accept {Loyola's Exercises}]

The section discussing the distribution of alms is followed by a chapter on the temptations of the enemy and the importance of understanding “scruples.”  Another section of this work details the “three types of men” and the “three kinds of humility.”  It advocates a position that “the intimate understanding and relish of truth” derives from self discovery rather than being preached at.  This work was first printed as a Latin translation by Andre des Freux known as the versio vulgata, though the bulk of this 1548 work was written during a retreat at Manresa. Containing such sections as “The Kingdom of Christ” and “The Two Standards,” it is divided into “weeks” and outlines a regimen of meditation that its author deemed central to the establishment of the Society of Jesus.  For 10 points, identify this pedagogical work by St. Ignatius of Loyola.

answer: {density} matrix

A system of N interacting bosons can be regarded as a Bose-Einstein condensate if the single particle this has one eigenvalue of order N and all the others of order 1. Banks, Peskin, and Susskind showed that if it obeys an equation more general than Schrödinger's, as suggested by Hawking, locality or energy conservation would be violated. The von Neumann entropy is minus the trace of this matrix times its logarithm. If and only if it is equal to its own square, it represents a pure state and could be alternately represented simply as a wavefunction. For 10 points, what is this mathematical description of general mixed states in quantum mechanics, with a name that evokes its use as a measure of the amount of "weight" of wave function per "volume" of configuration space?

answer: Jacobite Rebellion of 1745 or the {Forty}-{Five} (accept equivalents for {rebellion} as {long} as {year} is mentioned; prompt on {Jacobite Rebellion}, {Revolt}, etc. until {Jacobite} is mentioned)

Its leader was only able to escape after assuming the identity of Betty Burke, a servant to a supporter of his. The panic of December 6th or “Black Friday,” during this event is described in the memoirs of Chevalier de Johnstone, who took part in it. It was planned at meetings of the Association, a group that included the noblemen Lovat, Drummond, and Linton and began with the embarkation of the warships Doutelle and Elisabeth. The first major battle saw the defeat of forces under John Cope and skirmishes at Stirling Castle and Derby followed. Despite their initial victory at Prestonpans the instigators would be crushed the next year by a son of George II, the Duke of Cumberland. For 10 points, identify this uprising that ended with Bonnie Prince Charlie's defeat at Culloden, a Jacobite rebellion named for the year in which it began.

Seven sons of this figure were renamed Maine in order to satisfy the misleading prophecy of a druid, while this figure's daughter Findabair was promised in marriage to Fraech in return for a battle pledge, though his death caused Findabair to die of grief.  One story says that this figure died while bathing after being hit on the head by a hunk of cheese slung by Furbaide, who was avenging the death of his mother Eithni at the hands of this figure. This figure shares her name with the Celtic goddess of intoxication, and it was said that she could only be sexually satisfied by Fergus mac Roich, though her most famous partner was Ailill. Perhaps most famously, she grows jealous over Aillil's possession of Finnbennach, which starts the Cattle Raid of Cooley. For 10 points, name this Queen of Connaught.

In his talk on “Taste,” which he later turned into an essay, he took issue with the work of Malcom Morley and David Salle among others. In another essay he defined one of the titular movements by saying it originated in France in the poetry, painting, and prose fiction of Baudelaire, Manet, and Flaubert respectively. In addition to Modern and Postmodern he attempted to give proper credit for the titular art medium, to either Braque or Picasso, in his seminal essay Collage. In his major work he concluded that socialism was the means of preservation for whatever living culture, particularly artistic, that exists and also popularized the titular German word. He would go on to become an ardent supporter and promoter of Hans Hoffman and Jackson Pollock. For 10 points, name this art critic and author of “Avant-Garde and Kitsch.”

answer: {Vicente Ramon Guerrero Saldana}

Under his leadership persons of European descent were disenfranchised and those of pardo descent were favored.  Swept into power after the Parian Market was destroyed during the Acordada riots, his tenure ended after he was kidnapped by an Italian ship captain and executed.   At one point this man, who would go on to abolish slavery in his homeland, missed hooking up with the forces of Javier Mina, who would have boosted the army he had been put in charge of when Morelos named him commander of the South.  In addition to leading his army to victory at such battles as Huetamo and Santa Fe, this man who helped Iturbide draft the Plan of Iguala took power in 1829, but was deposed under the Plan of Jalapa that saw the rise of the conservatives under Lucas Alaman.  For 10 points, identify this revolutionary hero and early president of the Mexican republic.

One anecdote relates how he ordered a town to be sacked unless one of its citizens could finish an enormous flagon of wine which one citizen, Heinrich Toppler, did before dying. His own death occurred at a battle in which his subordinate and successor Aldringen was also wounded. After an indecisive encounter at Wiesloch, he embarked on a string of victories including one at Stadtlohn, where he defeated one of his rivals Ernst of Mansfield. Three years later his defeat of Christian IV at Lutter forced the Treaty of Lubeck, resulting in the entry of his eventual chief adversary. The events that followed included his sacking of Magdeburg and death at Lech. For 10 points, name this man who was crushed at Breitenfeld by Gustavus Adolphus, the commander of the forces of the Catholic League who had been made a count during the Thirty Years' War.
