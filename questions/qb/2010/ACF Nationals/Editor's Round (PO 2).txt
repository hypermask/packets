answer: {Toward} a Psychology of {Being}

This work defines three levels of “creativity” and cites the example of a man who knows he hates oysters but has never tried them in a section that addresses balancing the need to know with the fear of knowing.  Another section describes the dangers of “B-cognition” which can make actions impossible.  This work's discussion of “peak experiences” offers an alternate take on one of its author's key ideas and it sets out a checklist of the characteristics that define healthy humans including “more openness to experience” and “the ability to love.”  This work, which also features a chapter on the value of existentialism, ends with an appendix that asks, “Is a normative social psychology possible?” and is an elaboration of ideas its author previously presented in Motivation and Personality.  For 10 points, identify this work that outlines how human beings can become self-actualized, a work by Abraham Maslow.

answer: {Lucknow Pact}

This agreement was immediately preceded by one side's resolutions passed in the Kaiserbagh building and it grew out of a memorandum written two months earlier by 19 members of the Imperial Legislative Council. It built upon the Minto-Morley reforms of seven years earlier, specifically in terms of expansion of the numbers in both the Central and Provincial Legislative Councils. Due to unhappiness with its results, the leader of one side would go on to announce his “fourteen points” though by then it had already been weakened by the growing Khilafat movement. It was marked by cooperation between the moderates of Gokhale [go-kuh-lay] and the extremists of Tilak as well as the INC and its counterpart. For 10 points, name this agreement chiefly orchestrated by Muhammad Ali Jinnah in 1916 to improve Hindu-Muslim affairs and which was reached in the namesake Indian city.

answer: Algernon Charles {Swinburne}

This writer depicted a place where the “sun burns sere and the rain dishevels” in “The Forsaken Garden,” while his, Heptalogia, or the Seven Against Sense, offered a slew of parodies in the style of his contemporaries, such as the piece “The Higher Pantheism in a Nutshell.” He created a fictitious back-story about a damsel named Yolande de Sallieres in a work about a clerk who continues to caress the deformed body of his now dead mistress. That work, “The Leper,” was published in a controversial 1866 collection alongside another poem that begins— “Swallow, my sister, o swallow--” and is named “Itylus.”  Other works by this author include “Laus Veneris,” “Faustine,” and a piece addressed to “Our Lady of Pain:” “Dolores.”  For 10 points, identify this English poet of such works as “Ave Atque Vale,” “The Garden of Proserpine,” and Atalanta in Calydon.

answer: {vortex} [or {vortices}]

The Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the XY model arises from a Coulomb gas of these, whose proliferation is thermodynamically favored at high temperatures. They have an associated nonzero integer winding number and represent a form of localized disorder. In type II superconductors in an external magnetic field above the lower critical value, magnetic flux penetrates the conductor in the form of these. Kármán streets involve a staggered pattern of them. In fluid dynamics, they are detected by a namesake quantity computed as the curl of the velocity distribution. In the atmosphere they occur on many different scales, including tornados and hurricanes. For 10 points, what is this physical phenomenon in which there is some circular flux around a center?

answer: Cecil {Rhodes}

In a biography of this man entitled The Founder evidence of his homosexual relationship with his friend Neville Pickering is offered, while his cruelty and brutal rule is the subject of much of the final five chapters of Twain's Following the Equator. His power was nearly complete after establishing a company headed by himself, the Duke of Abercorm, and Alfred Beit. This allowed him to reach the so-called Rudd Concession, in which he and partner Charles Rudd came to an agreement with Lobengula. After acquisition of the Pitsani Strip, he attempted to stir up the Uitlanders [ootlanders] and the resultant failure led to this downfall. Thus he stepped down as prime minister of Cape Colony following the disastrous Jameson Raid.

answer: {vagueness} (do not accept {ambiguity})

The earliest explorations of this philosophical property are attributed to Eubulides of Miletus.  One modern attempt to deal with this property adheres to the principle of least mutiliation and rejecting the notion of bivalent truth; this view is known as “supervaluation.”  Another approach to considering this property, called epistemicism, holds that there is some cutoff that is fundamentally unknowable. That view was advanced in Timothy Williamson's book on this property, which asserted that “no one knows whether I am thin.”  Responsible for the sorities paradox or the paradox of the heap, for 10 points, identify this property defined by C.S. Peirce as what happens when a concept's meaning is intrinsically uncertain.

answer: {dimerization} (accept word forms; do not accept {heterodimerization} as all of the {examples refer} to {homodimerization}; accept {crosslinking} until “{XerCD}” is read)

Antenna pigments like deazaflavin or MTHF enhance the rate of F-A-D-H-minus-mediated reversal of this process by photolyases, and XerCD reverses this process in chromosomes in E. coli.  Attempting to conduct a bimolecular elimination of hydrogen bromide from 3-bromocyclopentene will cause this to happen via the Diels-Alder reaction as 1,3-butadiene is formed.  DNA-binding enzymes that display this characteristic typically have palindromic binding sites.  In substituted ethylenes, the formation of these involves diradical intermediates, and the simplest carboxylic acids exist in this form in solution.  For 10 points, name this phenomenon exhibited by two identical molecules binding to each other to produce the smallest type of polymer.

Cui would later use the opening melody of this work in the 9th piece of his Kaleidoscope: Orientale.  The first section ends with a fortissimo rendition of the plaintive folk song, “The Sun Does not Shine,” by a pair of trumpets, a moment that some critics suggest is meant to evoke a cry for help.  It ends with a swirling virtuoso coda for the full orchestra that features loud and ringing accents presumably announcing victory.   In later years, a portion of this work was replaced by inserting a melody by Glinka in the second section, where a rustic motif for the woodwinds is interrupted by a statement of “God Save the Tsar.”  Its composer's Opus 31, this work was written at the behest of Nikolai Rubinstein in 1876 for a benefit concert for Serbian soldiers wounded in the war against Turkey.

answer: fault {scarp}

A recent paper by Hilley et al discusses how to systematically identify them from airborne laser topographic data and estimate their ages, with examples in the Carrizo Plain and Mustang Ridge. The type occurring in Piedmont in the western U.S. are more easily dated than those in bedrock in the Aegean. Their shape evolves according to a diffusion equation smoothing out the sharp edge, with processes including bioturbation, rainsplash, and soil creep responsible for the slow change. They occur at the boundaries between horsts and grabens, and may be created by earthquakes. The Elkhorn one is associated with the San Andreas Fault. For 10 points, what is this geologic feature, in which a fault plane dislocates the ground surface and causes a step in elevation?
