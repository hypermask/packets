answer: {Annus Mirabilis}

In one section, the speaker compares smoke from a cannon to the vapors rising off a monster's hide.  In a letter to Sir Robert Howard, this work's author claimed that it was written in the style of Virgil, an assertion that fails to acknowledge the influence of William Davenant's Gondibert.  Stanza 155 introduces a “Digression concerning shipping and navigation” that leads into a section featuring the line “Who great in search of God and Nature grow,” the “Apostrophe to the Royal Society.”  Prefaced by “Verses to her Highness and Duchess” [of York], several of this work's 304 stanzas chronicle the Battle of Solebay, while a later section celebrates the work of Christopher Wren and the rebirth of London from a “chymic flame.”  Taking as its subjects the Second Anglo-Dutch War and the Great Fire, for 10 points, identify this work, subtitled or The Year of Wonders, 1666, a poem by John Dryden.

answer: {Kongo} empire

Much of its power was exercised by the “royal guard” which was recruited among the Hum and Tio peoples.  Its ruler was elected by special body of nine or twelve nobles, including the pagan kbunga, who retained a veto vote, but rarely exercised it.  At one point this empire, whose currency consisted of a particular type of seashell named the nzimbu, was led by a woman named Anna, who was initially forced to retreat to the neighboring Kingdom of Matamba, before rallying her Jaga warriors to subjugate Luanda.  It was during the reign of Nzinga Nkuwu that the colonists arrived from Sao Thome, setting in motion a pattern of cooperation and exploitation.  Led by rulers that bore the honorific Mani, for many years its capital was located at Sao Salvador.  For 10 points, identify this West African kingdom that was conquered by the Portuguese and existed south of a namesake river.

answer: {North Atlantic Oscillation} (or {NAO index})

Westgarth-Smith, Leroy, and Collins established that it is highly correlated with populations of P. aegeria, P. icarus, and other butterfly species in Britain. It has an analogue in the southern hemisphere, the Southern Annular Mode, which similarly acts as a source of stochastic noise in the climate system reddened by interactions with the ocean. It has been found that one to two years after it reaches a peak, the Gulf Stream is displaced northward. In its negative phase, moisture moves more toward the Mediterranean basin and leaves the UK drier and cooler, while its positive phase means a warm and wet winter and autumn in the UK. For 10 points, what is this phenomenon measured as a difference in air pressure between Iceland and the Azores, Lisbon, or Gibraltar, and named for its geographic location?

answer: {Rembrandt's Self}-{Portraits} or {Self}-{Portraits} of {Rembrandt} (accept equivalents)

Among the most exotic in this series was the one featuring a “Potentate” and a “Kris,” a kind of sword, and among the most humorous was the depiction of Zeuxis, an ancient Greek painter.  One of them is an interpretation of St. Paul and at least two feature a gorget [gore-JIT]. Some of them were initially given the title of conterfeycel, but not the late ones such as the penultimate, which utilized a doublet featured in the works of Dirk Bouts and Rogier van der Weyden. They include thirty-two etchings and number at least ninety-nine but only two of them feature Saskia, the artist's wife. Spanning a forty-year period between 1629 and 1669, For 10 points, name this series of depictions of the artist of The Night Watch.

answer: {Khalsa}

This designation was derived from a word alluding either to an upstanding officer of the revenue department or a piece of land directly under government control and it was first used in a religious setting by Kabir. Before it took on its current meaning the groups known as masands were abolished, and the man responsible for that new meaning clarified his purpose in the composition known as the 33 Swayya.  In common usage when prefaced by “Sarbatt” it can refer to a gathering of members of a certain religion. It came to identify a group who partook in the Pahul by taking a water-sugar drink in the Amrit Sanchar ceremony. That group would be differentiated from the Sahajdharis, who typically do not keep the kanga or the kirpan. For 10 points, name this group established by the Guru Gobind Singh as the purest of all Sikhs.

answer: {Sanjuro} (or {Tsubaki Sanjuro})

The novel on which this movie was based was also the source for another movie, Kill!, released six years later.  The DVD extras explain that 15,000 flower blossoms were hand painted for the shoot and the flowers were individually glued each day of production.  Humor is provided by the captured spy who occasionally pops out of his hiding spot in the closet to offer advice and the constant awakening of the title character by his bumbling wards.  That title character's name translates to 30-year-old camellia as opposed to his name meaning 30-year-old mulberry field in this movie's prequel. 29 men are killed by the title character while he protects nine incompetent members of a clan unlike his attempts in a prior movie to play the silk and sake gangs against each other.  For 10 points, name this film in which Toshiro Mifune plays the titular samurai, Akira Kurosawa's sequel to Yojimbo.

answer: {Jane Jacobs}

In one work, this thinker argues that two sets of virtues drive market action - "commercial sydrome" and "guardian syndrome" - one promotes honest collaboration and one does not, but in combination the systems form a "monstrous hybrid." Another work elucidates the three "transactions of decline" including military production, subsidies to poor regions, and advanced-backward trade. This thinker used the example of Japan developing bicycle repair shops in the late 1800s, which led the country to eventually produce its own bicycles, to demonstrate the idea of "import replacement." In addition to Systems of Survival, this author defended pursuing the sovereignty of Quebec in The Question of Separatism. This longtime opponent of Robert Moses described the "ballet of the sidewalks" in New York in arguing for mixed-use neighborhoods. For 10 points, name this urban studies pioneer and author of The Death and Life of Great American Cities.

answer: The {March}

This work introduces the Boozers, a mother-daughter team that cons the perverted Kilpatrick, as well as a London Times reporter named Hugh Pryce who dies after climbing a tree. It also describes the odd case of Albion Simms who lives life with a spike stuck in his head and is observed by a German surgeon.  Other chapters describe the travels of Mr. Culp, a photographer, who is accompanied by his black apprentice, Calvin Harper, and is eventually murdered by Arly Wilcox, a runaway on the losing side.  It opens with the taking of the Jameson farm and the introduction of the character Pearl, while a later section describes the romance of Wilma Jones and the banjo playing Coalhouse Walker, Sr., whose son appears in another of its author's works, Ragtime.  For 10 points, identify this 2005 novel whose action revolves around William Tecumseh Sherman's Southern campaign, a work by E.L. Doctorow.

answer: the Executive {Directory} (or {Directoire executive})

Its first president co-negotiated the surrender of the Batavian Republic to his country and another of its original members was the head of a deist sect known as the “Friends of God and Man.” Among its military successes was forcing the capitulation of the king of Sardinia and the establishment of the puppet state in Naples known as the Parthenopaean Republic. After its downfall a triumvirate was established with one of the seats being held by Roger Ducos. Of the original members, Rewbell, would resign and his replacement hatched a plot along with the help of another member Paul Barras. It had already been weakened by the military's defeats at the hands of Suvorov and the loss at Aboukir Bay. Established in the Consitution of the Year III and dissolved on 18 Brumaire, for 10 points, name this body of five members that, from 1795 to 1799, ruled France.

answer: {Ptah}

This god is mentioned on a votive stela on which Neferabu admits making a false oath in his name and losing his sight as a result, and begs for forgiveness. He is sometimes syncretized with the earth god Tatenen, and common epithets refer to him as “under the moringa tree” and as “Lord of Ankh-tawy.” He's also worshipped in hyphenated form with the mortuary deity Sokar. This god's son Nefertem appeared late as a member of his triad, and is sometimes said to have helped him create the world by thought and imagination. This god of craftsmen is most traditionally worshipped with his wife Sekhmet. For 10 points, name this predominant creator god of Memphis.

answer: {spin}-{orbit coupling} [or {spin}-{orbit} interaction]

In mercury telluride, the strength of this interaction leads to an inverted band structure. Because this effect is strong in heavy-fermion superconductors, a Cooper pair's spin is no longer a good quantum number in such materials. Aside from the namesake quantities, its Hamiltonian is proportional to Z alpha, and it is of second order in the electron velocity over the speed of light. When it is weak, Landé's interval rule states that the interval between successive levels that it splits is proportional to the total angular momentum of the higher level. It leaves a 2 J + 1 degeneracy and can be thought of as an internal Zeeman effect. For 10 points, what is this quantum-mechanical interaction responsible for fine structure, which is linear in the spin of the electron and written as S dot L?

answer: {Capriccio Espagnol} or {Spanish Caprice} or {Kaprichio na ispankskiye temi}

The second section of this work presents four variations on a “sighing” theme initially presented on the strings, then the horns, then the full orchestra.  The fourth section of this work features a difficult cadenza in which the flute and clarinet take turns, before the harp enters to play shimmering scales, which, in turn, sets the stage for the introduction of a Gypsy Song.  Featuring an instruction to play all the way through without pause, the opening theme, a morning serenade, returns throughout this work which climaxes with a fiery Fandango, emphasized by cutting strings, cymbals, and castanets.  This work in five movements was completed in 1887 and was inspired by Inzenga and Castellanos' Book of Songs.  For 10 points, identify this work that begins with the “Alborada,” a work based on Asturian folk themes by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

answer: {nuclear envelope} (accept {nuclear membrane}, {perinuclear envelope}, {nucleolemma}, or {karyotheca}; {nuclear lamina} and {nucleus} are not acceptable at any point)

In flies, the recruitment of MSL proteins to sites within this structure is necessary for dosage compensation, and KASH domain proteins interact with SUN domain proteins within this structure.  Nesprins anchor this structure to the actin cytoskeleton, while emerin and other proteins containing LEM domains help anchor it to a proteinaceous structure on its inner surface.  In most organisms this structure is destroyed during cell division and is subsequently reformed from the endoplasmic reticulum under the guidance of the lamin A receptor.  125-megadalton protein complexes composed of Nups form channels through this structure, allowing mRNAs and proteins containing NES sequences to be exported to the cytoplasm.  For 10 points, name this double-layered structure that surrounds the nucleus.

answer: The {Caucasian Chalk Circle} or {Die Kaukasische Kreidekreis}

Twice during this work, one character asks to examine another character's hand.  The second time, a fugitive offers to pay his suspicious rescuer 150,000 piastres to protect him.  In another episode, a funeral and a wedding occur simultaneously, that is, until the “corpse” hears the war with the princes is over, at which point he recovers.  Scene 3 sees the protagonist crossing a rotten bridge to reach the Northern Mountains.  There she finds shelter with her brother Lavrenti.  Punctuated throughout by various songs, it was written during its author's stay in California and it focuses on a peasant woman's journey to protect the Governor's abandoned child from the Ironshirts.  The climax is presided over by the unconventional judge, Azdak, who administers the titular test after drawing it on the floor.  For 10 points, name this play that ends with Grusha proving her love for baby Michael, a work by Bertolt Brecht.

answer: Jay {Gould}

Charles Francis Adams notably criticized this man in a North American Review article.  This author of A History of Delaware County was never listed by Mrs. William Astor in her list of the New York 400, even though he was worth more than many men on the list.  Although some of his partners, like Russell Sage, made a fortune, others like Charles Leupp and Cyrus Field were less fortunate.  His first success came after he founded a tanning factory and he would later establish an office in Jersey City to illegally issue stock in an attempt to best Cornelius Vanderbilt for control of the Erie Railroad.  He tried to influence Horace Potter through the President's brother in law, A.H. Corbin, and a share of his investments, a situation that culminated on September 24, 1869, when the price of gold dropped precipitously.  For 10 points, identify this American financier and railroad magnate whose actions, alongside his partner, Jim Fisk, precipitated “Black Friday.”

The second part analyzes the mitigation of risks and dangers with the establishment of a “regimen in general” in the chapter “Dietetics.”  The third part, which opens with a section on dreams and the “method of Artemidorus,” explores what its author refers to as “The Question of Monopoly” in the context of marriage.  The first part, which includes the chapter “We “Other Victorians,”” argues that, “Confession came to be constituted in scientific terms,” and posits capitalism as an outcome of the controlled insertion of bodies into the machinery of production in its analysis of “bio-power.”  That volume, which preceded the other completed volumes The Care of Self and The Use of Pleasure, was translated as both An Introduction” and The Will to Knowledge.  For 10 points, identify this three volume treatise tracing the experience of erotic desire in Western Society, a work by Michel Foucault.

answer: {crown ethers} (prompt on {ethers})

Hydrophilic TEG yoctowells mimic the interactions of these compounds with oligamines.  These compounds are good candidates for rotaxane wheels because of their relatively easy synthesis and modification.  The Manning reaction is used to generate their aza derivatives as well as nitrogen-substituted versions of these molecules, which are known as cryptands.  A twelve-carbon example of this class of molecules catalyzes the formation of  “purple benzene” by complexing the potassium ion of potassium permanganate.  They can be formed by reacting oligoethylene glycols with oligoethylene glycol ditosylates or dichlorides in a modification of the Williamson synthesis.  For 10 points, name this class of macrocyclic organic compounds whose subunits contain oxygen bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups.

answer: James Ramsay {MacDonald}

He was voted out of his country's parliament for anti-war activities that included founding the Union of Democratic control and later the right-wing press printed a copy of his birth certificate, showing his illegitimate birth. He returned to parliament four years later and defeated J.R. Clynes for his party's leadership. He ended his political career as Lord President of the Council for two years, in political isolation as a result of making a power-sharing pact with the Conservatives four years prior. Winston Churchill gave him the nickname “boneless wonder” and in 1906 he made a pact with Gladstone's Liberals that bore fruit nearly two decades later. For 10 points, name this man who was twice succeeded by Stanley Baldwin, and who in 1924 and 1929 he became British Prime Minister, the first Laborite to do so.

The title of one of this author's works is taken from the last line of Guillaume Appollinaire's “Zone” and is called Solar Throat Slashed.  This author, who would abandon Surrealism, worked in odd formats such as his “oratorio” for the stage, And the Dogs Were Silent.  Other works include the elegies “The Tomb of Paul Eluard” and “Statue of Lafcadio Hearn” which were collected in this author's volume Ferraments, whose title refers obliquely to the shackles that once bound his ancestors.  His overtly political works include a play about a ruler of Haiti and another about the execution of Patrice Lumumba.  Those works, The Tragedy of King Christophe and A Season in the Congo, were written after he helped found a literary movement alongside Leon Damas and Leopold Senghor.  For 10 points, identify this author of “Notes From a Return to the Native Land,” a Martinique born founder of Negritude.

answer: {Hubbard} model

Recently, experimental realizations of this model have been achieved in optical lattices, first a bosonic analogue and later the original fermionic version in work of Köhl et al. An important limiting case was derived by Spalek in 1977, applying a projection operator to remove double-occupancy states. This is a large U limit of it, called the t-J model. It was introduced by its namesake in 1963 in a study that revealed a type of metal-insulator transition. Its Hamiltonian involves a hopping term that moves an electron from one site to another, and a potential energy term giving on-site Coulomb repulsion. For 10 points, what is this model of interacting electrons, introduced in 1963 by a British physicist who also invented a transformation named for him and Stratonovich?

Earlier in the work a house guest noted that he was willing to give ten dollars in return for a favor, while another character reminisced about her son Dan, a great wanderer who left the North East for California.  Published in a namesake collection, some two years before its author's novel on a similar theme, A Country Doctor, it opens as the protagonist is attempting to use a twig of birch leaves to guide home a cow named Mistress Mooly.  Ultimately, Mrs. Tilley's granddaughter decides not to tell the young man with the gun where a particular creature can be found.

Groups of people referred to by this term include a set of Prussian religious dissidents who settled in Serbin, Texas in the 1850s; and the Liutizes, who in the ninth and tenth centuries formed a union centered around Riedegost-Rethra. The group as a whole unsuccessfully resisted a crusade in the 1100s led by Valdemar the Great of Denmark, who captured this people's main settlement at Arkona and gained control of Pomerania. The Kashubs and Sorbs in Germany and Poland are the only existing ethnic groups to identify themselves with these peoples whose name was used in the early Middle Ages to refer to almost any Slavic people living within the Holy Roman Empire. For 10 points, identify these peoples who got their name as a result of false etymology with a barbarian tribe that also gave its name to a major maritime city-state in northeast Italy?
