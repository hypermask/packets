The work in which she appears opens by describing her idyllic childhood with  Herta, Berta, and Hulda.  This character fears that her home is haunted by a ghost she calls the Chinaman, and discusses this situation with a hunchbacked chemist named Gieshubler.  She has an awkward meeting with her daughter Annie, years after her carelessly hidden letters reveal a relationship with a dashing Major. That affair is what caused her husband, the Prussian politician Innstetten, to immediately divorce her. For 10 points, name this tragic lover of Crampas, the title character of a novel by Theodor Fontane.

answer: Sir John {Major}

In one election, this politician contradicted his opponent's Sheffield Rally by standing on an actual soapbox and shouting through a megaphone in Luton. He appointed the Nolan Committee to investigate the Cash-for-Questions affair, which involved Harrod's owner Mohamed Al-Fayed bribing members of his party. He defeated Neil Kinnock in general election before signing the Downing Street Declaration with Albert Reynolds. This man withdrew the pound from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism after its value fell on Black Wednesday. He was opposed by the Maastricht Rebels, members of his own party who opposed that treaty. He also governed during the First Gulf War before being defeated by the New Labour party. For 10 points, name this successor of Margaret Thatcher, a conservative Prime Minister of the UK for much of the 1990s.

answer: {Sic et Non}

This work's prologue analyzes Boethius' claim, in the Topics, that accident and substance were the two “primary kinds of things,” to make a general point about the prevalence of “opinion.”  It included a prefix that sought to demonstrate the authenticity of its sources by noting that all were approved by Pope Gelasius' decree.  It criticized poetical, figurative language as “obscure and vague,” though it made special exception for the Scriptures by noting that if anything in them strikes a reader as absurd that it must be the fault of the scribe. This work centers on a series of 158 propositions and offers citations from other works by Church fathers and theologians that either support or contradict a certain position in order to suggest that, even, ecclesiastical, truth is up for debate.  For 10 points, identify this religious treatise, with a Latin title that translates as Yes and No, a work by Peter Abelard.

answer: {Franco Modigliani}

This economist developed a theory suggesting that bond investors have a preference for a maturity length that can only be overturned if there is a risk premium, called “preferred habitat theory.” Along with Duesenberry he names a consumption function that postulates that current consumption is determined not just by current income, but also by its previous highest peak.  He designed a large scale model of the US economy for the Federal Reserve, the MPS.  He also partially names a theorem that demonstrated that under certain assumptions, the value of a firm is not affected by whether it is financed by equity or debt.  With Robert Brumberg, he postulated that young and old households have a higher propensity to consume while middle aged households have a higher propensity to save, the “Life Cycle Hypothesis of Saving.”  For 10 points, name this 1985 Nobel winner, who formulated a capital structure theorem with Merton Miller.

answer: {Voltaire} (or {Francois}-{Marie Arouet})

Thomas Jefferson had a bust of this figure in Monticello on the first floor in the Entrance Hall. A notable sculpture of him was inspired by a Roman statue entitled Old Fisherman depicting a dying Seneca. That statue shows him with emaciated flesh and engorged veins and prompted an offer from King Gustavus III of Sweden to pay for clothes as a result of the scandal over this figure being sculpted nude.  In response, another sculpture of this man was done clothing him in fine drapery and based on several posing sessions he did upon his return to Paris in 1778. That sculpture of him “seated” initially proved more popular than the nude done by Jean Pigalle. For 10 points, name this writer sculpted several times by Jean-Antoine Houdon.

answer: {anisotropy}

The Hughes-Drever experiment ruled out a second light tensor field in general relativity by noting that if not proportional to the metric, it would induce this. A spectrophotometric method named for this property evaluates the polarization of fluorescent probes to generate a binding curve; in this method, the G-factor relates differently oriented light sources. The magnetocrystalline form of this property represents the energy needed to deflect the magnetic moment of a single crystal based on the spin-orbit coupling that occurs within the crystal lattice. An object that possesses this property can undergo birefringence due to orientation-dependent differences in its index of refraction. For 10 points, name this characteristic of substances like graphite with direction-dependent properties.

answer: {Red River} Rebellion (or {Red River Resistance})

Sources on this event include a journal by Joseph Hargrave and Alexander Begg, as well as the "Eight Letters" to the "Honorable Joseph Howe in Reply to an Official Pamphlet," in which Howe is accused of being its chief instigator. A nationalist group led by the doctor John Christian Schultz created the impetus for this event, despite the attempts of Adams Archibald to put forth a conciliatory plan. One of that group's members, Thomas Scott, was executed on trumped-up treason charges and violence continued until a supposed peace expedition under Garnet Wolseley was dispatched to Fort Garry. Also sparked by appointment of William McDougall as governor of Rupert's Land, its leader would reprise his role fifteen years later in the Northwest Rebellion.  For 10 points, name this rebellion led by Louis Riel and named for a region in Manitoba.

answer: The {Rebel}

Part four of this work asserts that a society based on production is “only productive, not creative.”  In the section “The Deicides” it criticizes Hegel for having rationalized to the point of being irrational.  This work also chastised Marx for his argument that history has a definitive end and lamented the rise of bureaucrats and doctrinaires in a chapter entitled “State Terrorism and Irrational Terror.”  This work ultimately rejects the “adolescent furies” represented by such thinkers as De Sade and proposes a moderate approach to opposing suppression.  Opening with the aphorism “Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is,” this work warned against the titular individual's potential to descend into nihilism.  Published nine years after its author's The Myth of Sisyphus, for 10 points, identify this philosophical work subtitled “An Essay on Man in Revolt,” a book by Albert Camus.

answer: {Hausdorff} space [or T2 space before mentioned]

The Smirnov metrization theorem asserts that a locally metrizable space must be a paracompact one of these in order to be metrizable. The real numbers in a topology with basis open intervals and open intervals minus the set of inverse positive integers is not regular, but it is this. Every simply ordered set is one of these spaces in the ordered topology. A space X is this if and only if the diagonal is closed in the product space X times X. In a space of this type, a sequence of points converges to at most one point. This class of topological space has the property that any two points have disjoint neighborhoods and thus possess finite subsets that are closed by the T2 separation axiom. For 10 points, what is this type of topological space, named for a mathematician also known for a concept of dimension often used for fractals?

According to one legend, a statue of this figure makes a sound like a broken harp string when it is struck by the first rays of the sun. He had a brother named Emathion who was killed by Heracles. After his death, this figure's ashes from his funeral pyre were transformed into two flocks of birds which fought each other. He attacked Nestor when that king's chariot was stopped by the arrows of Paris, and ended up killing his son Antilochus. After killing Antilochus, this man managed to wound Achilles in the arm before being killed by him. His death is often given as the reason for the dew, as it caused by the ceaseless tears of his mother. This son of Eos and Tithonus conquered Egypt en route to bringing a huge army to reinforce Troy. For 10 points, name this king of Ethiopia who fought against the Greeks during the Trojan War.

answer: {Clebsch}-{Gordan} coefficients [or Wigner 3j {coefficient}]

They are employed in vector coupling for the three dimensional rotation group SO(3) where they have a high degree of symmetry since SO(3) is a simply reducible group. In representation theory, they can be defined as the elements of the matrix reducing the direct product of two irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. Generalizations include Racah coefficients or Wigner 6j and 9j symbols, for cases in which the integral product of greater than three spherical harmonics are desired. They can be computed by expressing a product of two spherical harmonics as a sum of individual spherical harmonics. For 10 points, name these numbers that are commonly employed to obtain the coupling amplitude between uncoupled and coupled representations of angular momenta in quantum mechanics.

answer: {Chinese Exclusion} Act of 1882

This legislation was the target of the Morse-Everett Amendment, which proposed to delay its effects for a period of six months. The passage of this law was foreshadowed by the court case In Re Tiburcio Parrott and supported in an influential speech by governor John Bigler. Also supported by Dennis Kearney and his Workingman's Party, this legislation was extended by the Scott Act, before finally being repealed by the Magnuson Act. Despite being loudly opposed by senator George Frisbie Hoar, it resulted in numerous incidents at Angel Island after it was renewed by the Geary Act in 1892.
