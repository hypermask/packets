answer: {Petition} of {Right}

The opening section of this document refers to the "Stratutum de Tellagio non Concedendo" as precedent. It was partly prompted by the promotion of chaplain Roger Maynwaring, which was strenuously objected to by John Selden. It was also a direct response to Chief Justice Hyde in Darnell's Case, and acted as a rebuttal of that case's arguments Its drafters purposely avoided referring to tunnage and poundage, which had recently been withheld in protest to the foreign policy of the Duke of Buckingham. This document drafted by Edward Coke asserts the inability of the monarch to impose martial law in peacetime, as well as freedom from arbitrary imprisonment. For 10 points, name this 1628 document which was grudgingly accepted by Charles I.

answer: {Wnt} signaling pathway

The role of this pathway in Clara cell regeneration was established by Roel Nusse, One non-canonical example of this pathway activates the enzymes CamKII and PKC enzymes through PDE6, while another interacts with the JNK and PCP pathways; both of these pathways play a role in convergent extension and planar cell polarity. This pathway is named for a related family of growth factors that, canonically, bind to LRP and a cysteine-rich segment of Frizzled in developing cells. This binding activates Disheveled, which inhibits GSK-3 and leads to a build up of beta-catenin. That protein activates target genes responsible for developing dorsal structures. Like Hedgehog and Notch, this pathway is active during development. For 10 points, name this signaling pathway that is vital in establishing the dorsal-ventral axis.

answer: {sonoluminescence}

Detailed measurements of this phenomenon have been made by Barber and Putterman by measuring Mie [MEE] scattering.  Most scientists have rejected Julian Schwinger's explanation of this in terms of emission of zero-point energy.  The first experimental observation of this process was made in 1934 by Frenzel and Schultes, and interest in this effect was renewed by a discovery of a special form of it in 1990 by Felipe Gaitan. The Taleyarkhan group claims to have generated nuclear fusion via this process.  Although the mechanism for it is still controversial, most believe that the observed radiation is due to bremsstrahlung that is produced by an in-falling shockwave caused by the collapse of an object that may be produced by cavitation.  For 10 points, identify this process in which sound waves are passed through a liquid, causing bubbles to collapse and emit short bursts of light.

A set of 36 "adnotationes" to this work was compiled by Prosper Marchand; the first of those observes that if the third root letter of a word in a certain language is called "quiescent," then it is usually omitted.  This work claimed to be published in Hamburg by "Heinrich Kuhnraht," actually an early 17th century German mystic.  Its preface observes that Alexander the Great learned to fear fortune at the Gates of Susa, but later ceased using soothsayers after he defeated Darius; this is taken to show that fear is "the root from which superstition is born."  It argues that "authority in sacred matters belongs wholly to sovereign powers" and celebrates the fact that "in a free state, everyone is allowed to think what they wish."  For 10 points, name this work published in 1670 which offers a historical analysis of the Bible, a work by Baruch Spinoza.

answer: energy {band gap}

A common empirical formula for the temperature-dependence of its magnitude gives its value as equal to its zero-temperature value minus alpha times T2, divided by the quantity T plus beta, and this is known as Varshni's formula.  Depending on the material, it can be either “direct” or “indirect.”  For the “indirect” case, conservation of momentum requires a phonon to be emitted during recombination, and during recombination, a particle travels from the top of it to the bottom of it. It can be crudely modeled in the Kronig-Penney model, and for undoped materials, the Fermi level is directly in the middle of this region.  For 10 points, identify this characteristic of semiconductors, a region of forbidden energies separating the valence and conduction electrons.
