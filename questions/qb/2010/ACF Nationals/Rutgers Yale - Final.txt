answer: The {White Devil}

At the end of the first printing of this play, the author included an epigram of Martial's, "Haec fuerint nobis praemis si placui," and thanked the actor Richard Perkins for his "well-approved industry." It features a ghost urging a brother to avenge a fallen woman, as well as a dirge sung by a grieving mother, “Call for the robin redbreast, and the wren.”  The action is set in motion when the central character recounts a dream about a "goodly yew tree" whose branch falls on and kills two people trying to uproot it. This leads to a plot whose outcome is displayed by a Conjuror in the shows that make up Act II, scene ii: Camillo's death is staged as a vaulting accident, while the Duchess, Isabella, kisses a poisoned portrait of her husband.  Flamineo carries out these murders in the service of the Duke of Bracciano and his adulterous lover, Vittoria. For 10 points, identify this revenge tragedy by John Webster.

answer: {intercalating agents} [accept {intercalators}]

Naphthaline diimides exemplify the “threading” variety of this class of compounds.  Most of them are cationic and planar in structure, a feature that allows them to displace the cationic sheath often formed by magnesium and sodium ions.  The interaction of these compounds with their targets is facilitated by breathing and causes the targets to lengthen, differentiating these chemicals from compounds like distamycin A. Leonard Lerman described the “classical” model of these compounds based on his work with acridine orange. Another example, doxorubicin, is a topoisomerase II poison, while all of these compounds partially unwind their target substrate, inhibiting RNA polymerase II and causing insertions and deletions. For 10 points, name this group of mutagens which includes ethidium bromide, all of which distort the structure of DNA by inserting between base pairs.

Participants on one side of this conflict produced electrum coinage featuring an incuse square divided into four smaller squares. The last major battle of this conflict saw navy under Dionysius of Phokae defeated by Datis the Mede after the defection of the Samians - that defeat at Lade resulted in the capture of the leading city of one side of this conflict. The designs of Aristagoras, first to take Naxos and, then, to retain power after that expedition's failure, led to this war. The Carians were drawn in through the burning of Sardis, though Athens withdrew from this clash following the subsequent defeat at Ephesos. Claimed by Herodotos as the spur for Persia's later attack of mainland Greece, for 10 points, name this conflict which featured the uprising of Miletos and other cities against Darius I, and occurred in the namesake region.

answer: {disproportionation} [accept {dismutation}; on the {Banks/Bailey} clue, accept {metathesis}]

A reaction of this type using a molybdenum hexacarbonyl catalyst was developed by Banks and Bailey and yields 2-pentene as one of its products.  Acidifying a solution of manganate ion yields a reddish-orange solution through this type of reaction. Microbes like D. propionocus catalyze a version of this process in which fractionation occurs between different isotopes of sulfur. As an alternative to combination, this process may be used to terminate free radical polymerization.  In many bacterial species, a cytochrome C-associated protein catalyzes a reaction of this type which promotes the formation of water and oxygen from hydrogen peroxide; this reaction is also catalyzed by catalase. For 10 points, name this type of reaction in which compound undergoes both reduction and oxidation to yield two distinct species.

answer: Saul {Kripke}

A forthcoming essay by this philosopher discusses the nature of the self and is based on a lecture he gave entitled, "The First Person." Other important unpublished works by him include a work on the theory of R.G. Collingwood as well as an algebraic proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem. His 1982 work on Philosophical  Investigations provided the most comprehensive account of Wittgenstein's account of rules and private language.  His best-known work uses the example of the possibility of heating or cooling a meter stick to demonstrate that the statement that one meter is equal to the length of a meter stick is false in some possible worlds. That work argues for the existence of necessary a posteriori and contingent a priori truths and introduces the concept of the rigid designator. For 10 points, identify this analytic philosopher and author of Naming and Necessity.

answer: Richard {Dedekind}

A problem named for this man is equivalent to finding the number of free distributive lattices with n generators, but it is more commonly stated as determining the number of monotonic increasing Boolean functions of n variables. His number-theoretic psi function involves taking the product over all distinct prime factors p of n of (1 + 1/p), then multiplying by n. A type of integral domain named for him is an integrally closed Noetherian domain for which every nonzero prime ideal is also a maximal ideal. Another concept associated with this mathematician is a partition of the rationals into two nonempty subsets S1 and S2 such that all members of S1 are less than those of S2, and S1 has no greatest element. For 10 points, identify this mathematician who thus constructed the reals from the rationals with his namesake "cuts."

answer: The {Battle} of Alexander at {Issus} (or {Alexanderschlacht})

A mosaic of this event was found in Pompeii in the House of the Faun and modeled on an earlier Greek painting by Philoxenus of Eretria. Jan Bruegel's depiction of the same subject was painted in 1602 and is in the Louvre, but the most famous remains the one commissioned by Duke William IV. Oddly there is a crescent moon at the top left and a sparkling sun at the upper right. More suspicious are the presence of a group of women on the left, the excessive size of Cyprus, and the presence of mountain ranges in particular the large mountain at the center of this painting. The historian Aventinus provided the numbers and information, later rewritten in Latin, that appear in the tablet hanging from the sky at the top, as well as the information on the banners of the two principal forces. For 10 points, this is what depiction of a victory of Alexander the Great over Darius III in 333 BC by Albrecht Altdorfer?

Recent evidence collected here has suggested that the lime-rich marl clay prompted residents to locate this site in the middle of an immense marshland. More recent work by Martin and Russell has overturned the earlier claim by Perkins that it was the earliest center of cattle domestication, and Halbaek has cited the discovery of hackberries at all levels here as evidence of alcohol production. Its commercial importance was related to Hasan Dag, a nearby volcano and the source of obsidian. Plastered auroch skulls and other objects decorated by horns are taken as evidence of an important bull cult here, though since the discovery of an obese female statue with two leopards by Melaart, this site has been associated with goddess worship.

answer: “The {Dry Salvages}” ({pronounced} to {rhyme} with “{assuages}”)

Its final section lists fiddling with tea leaves as one of many “features of the Press.”  The speaker of this work recalls “fruition, fulfillment… or even a very good dinner” but asserts that some may have had “the experience but missed the meaning,” and later asks, “I sometimes wonder if that is what Krishna meant.”  With their invocation of an April dooryard and the clanging of a bell, lines 36 and 48 of this work have been interpreted as allusions to Whitman and a sort of homecoming for its author.  Section four is addressed to a Lady who is encouraged to pray for all “who are in ships” from a shrine “on a promontory.”  Composed in five sections, it begins, “I do not know much about gods,” and is named for a rock formation off the coast of Massachusetts.  For 10 points, name this T.S. Eliot poem, which is a part of the Four Quartets along with “East Coker,” “Burnt Norton,” and “Little Gidding.”

answer: {Carboniferous} period

During this period, the Rheic Oceans disappeared, while the Hercynian and Appalachian Mountains formed as Laurussia and Godwanaland collided together. It saw the diversification of skates, rays, and other members of Elasmobranchii. Arthropleura and Meganeura, the largest documented invertebrate and flying insect, respectively, overcame traditional limitations on gigantism as atmospheric oxygen levels reached 35%. The Gzhelian Age at the end of this period featured a diversification of reptiles as sea levels receded, and tetrapods gained greater access to inland areas due to the development of the amniote egg. The development of lignin and the evolution, from cordaites, of conifers during this period contributed to its namesake fossils. For 10 points, name this geological period that follows the Devonian, whose name derives from the many coal beds that were laid down during it.
