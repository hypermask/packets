answer: The {Acharnians}

A character in this play claims that he is descended from Demeter and Triptolemus just before being dragged out of the Pnyx, and some ambassadors deliberately misinterpret insults as promises of gold; those insults come from a character referred to as the “Great King's Eye.”  Three leather straps are “elected” as commissioners and the protagonist is offered three symbolic wineskins by Amphitheus.  The informer Nicarchus is traded to a Theban, while two girls are disguised as pigs and sold after the protagonist opens a market.  The protagonist avoids being stoned by the chorus by threatening a basket of coals with a knife and later dresses in the rags of Telephus which he borrows from Euripides.  The end of this play mirrors the protagonist's drunken revels with Lamachus's war preparations.  For 10 points, name this Aristophanes play in which Dikaiopolis signs a personal peace with the Spartans despite the wishes of the title people.

answer: {insulators}

A novel version of this class of material was recently observed in a thin film of titanium nitride. The observed effect may be a particle-vortex dual of the BCS phenomenon, and was dubbed a "super-" this. Another variety exhibits the quantum spin Hall effect, when charges move only on the boundary of a material that is considered a "topological" one. A more well-known class of these materials has strong electron-electron interactions, and is named for Neville Mott. The most easily understood ones have a band gap, so that electrons cannot enter excited states. For 10 points, what is this class of materials that do not conduct electricity?

This figure consoled a friend by calling him one of the Three Ungrasping Chieftains before inviting that friend to visit his domain. He became transfixed by an object attached to four endless chains hanging from the sky; the spell of that golden bowl was broken only after his companion captured the wife of Llwyd son of Cil Coed in the form of a mouse.  Some enchanted horses and dogs were used to cheat this figure out of some swine, after which he was killed in single combat by Gwydion. He was discovered on the night that a mare colted and was raised by Teyrnon Twryf Liant. This figure married Cigfa and traveled as a companion of Manawydan.

The alternate recycling type of this technique has been applied to the study of gold nanocrystals.  The methods of Whitaker and Andrews are used for determining molecular weight with this technique, which frequently involves the use of dextran blue as a void volume marker.  Desalting apparati like G-twenty-fives, use the same matrix as this technique, and it is useful for studying ligand-binding because ligand-bound protein elutes earlier than unbound protein. This type of column chromatography tends to dilute samples because it does not involve adsorption or gradient elution, and it is often used to distinguish protein monomers from oligomeric complexes.  For 10 points, name this type of chromatography in which porous sepharose beads are used to separate proteins by mass.
