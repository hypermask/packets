answer: {urea} cycle

Valproate, or Depakote, can cause encephalopathy in individuals in which this pathway is defective, and CSPI deficiency is a particularly severe disorder affecting this pathway. Disorders in this pathway may be treated with sodium phenylbutyrate, which is metabolized to phenylacetate in the body.  One enzyme in this pathway is an isomer of an enzyme that makes up part of the CAD complex in pyrimidine biosynthesis; that enzyme is allosterically regulated by N-acetylglutamate and is called CPS-I. In one step in this pathway, carbamyl phosphate is combined with ornithine to produce citrulline. Originally discovered by  Henseleit and Krebs, for 10 points, name this cycle which is used to remove nitrogen from unneeded amino acids from the body.

answer: {chaos}

It often arises near transverse homoclinic points, as in the Smale horseshoe. A Poincaré section or first-return map for this type of dynamics will exhibit a fractal structure. In examples such as the logistic map, as a parameter is increased a sequence of period doubling bifurcations characterized by the Feigenbaum constant leads to its onset. It is characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents, meaning that small errors in initial data grow quickly and make practical long-term predictions impossible. Devaney specified three requirements for it: topological transitivity, dense periodic orbits, and sensitivity to initial conditions. For 10 points, what is this physical phenomenon, exemplified by the weather, in which a deterministic system exhibits apparently random behavior?

answer: “The {Hedgehog} and the {Fox}”

Part V of this work asserts that Proudhon's veneration of violence made his ideas incompatible with those of its subject.  This work traces the paradoxical nature of a man who is able to express the “oscillations of feeling” that animate the individual, yet champions a metaphysics based on determinism.  It analyzes a definition of “greatness” that turns on the incapacity of persons like Marx to recognize their own insignificance, and traces the influence of Joseph de Maistre's ideas on a certain writer who, as this work asserts, should be treated as a philosopher rather than a novelist.  This work, which posits a distinction between two types of intellectuals, begins with a fragment taken from Archilochus stating that although one of the title creatures knows “many things,” the other knows “one big thing.” For 10 points, identify this work subtitled “An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History,” a work by Isaiah Berlin.

answer: {Monsanto} Process

The developer of this process also developed a method for generating straight-chain detergents with a platinum catalyst and was named James Roth. Sunley and Watson developed a variation on this reaction that uses an alternative iridium-based catalyst. It inspired a similar process which takes place under anhydrous conditions and is named after Tennessee Eastman. The catalyst for this compound adopts a d8 configuration during its first step, an oxidative addition, and subsequently participates a reductive elimination step after an insertion reaction involving carbon monoxide. It supplanted the earlier Wacker and BASF methods and, unlike the Cativa process, uses homogeneous rhodium iodide as a catalyst. For 10 points, name this commercial process in which carbon monoxide is combined catalytically with methanol to produce acetic acid, developed by the company that manufactures RoundUp.

In dispersive media, this man's namesake theorem involves a term proportional to the imaginary part of permittivity times the square of electric field, accounting for absorptive dissipation. Without dissipation, his theorem states that the partial time derivative of energy density, plus J dot E, equals minus the divergence of his vector. This expresses conservation of energy in electrodynamics. The Abraham-Minkowski debate is the question of how to generalize his vector to fields in materials. For a plane wave, his vector points in the direction of propagation and has a magnitude of epsilon-nought times the electric field squared. For 10 points, who is this English physicist whose namesake vector gives the  energy flux transported by an electromagnetic field, proportional to E cross B?

Jared Spicer wrote a 1968 poetry collection with this name, while a children's book by Frances Darling with this title details Reuben's fourth birthday and how he almost misses a family photograph.  Hal Blythe claims the most famous poem of this name is an exercise in perspective and should be read like a screenplay.  The central image of that poem is often interpreted as an intermediary between man and nature as well as being an archetype of purification, fertility, and growth.  This poem's central image may also signify female maturation contrasted with the innocent color of the nearby animals; it may have been inspired by gazing through the window of a dying girl's bedroom, which was “glazed with rain.” For 10 points name this poem about a titular conveyance adjacent to poultry by William Carlos Williams.

The first three parts of this composer's Songs for Achilles were taken from an opera in which the titular Trojan is killed by Neoptolemus, while another of his operas sees Jo Ann fall in love with Merlin, who arrives in Act I on a spaceship.  This composer created the song cycle The Heart's Assurance for the tenor Peter Pears and may have used The Magic Flute as a basis for his first opera The Midsummer Marriage.  His oratorios include The Mask of Time and one featuring African-American spirituals such as "Go Down Moses" and "Deep River."
