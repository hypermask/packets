answer: {necklaces} (accept {bracelet} until {Eriphyle})

In Hindu tradition, the goddess Sitala was ejected from Shiva's paradise of Kailasa for throwing one of these at Shiva and giving him ulcers. Members of spiritual houses in Umbanda tradition are given one of these called an ileke, which are each associated with certain orishas. Another one of these was stolen by the tyrant Phayllus during the Sacred Wars, after it had been sent away to a shrine by the sons of king Phegeus. Earlier, that example of one of these objects had persuaded Eriphyle to betray her husband Amphiaraus, after it had been given to her by Polynices. Another example of one of these was obtained by sleeping with four dwarves on consecutive nights. For 10 points, name these objects which include the Brisingamen possessed by Freya and the cursed one of Harmonia.

answer: {Publius Papinius Statius}

This author wrote a collection of 32 poems that ends with an elegy on his adopted son.  That work “A Lament for his Boy” is preceded by an ode to the god of slumber entitled “Sleep.”  That collection also featured a title that would later be adapted by Poliziano to characterize an entire genre of occasional verse.  Another work by author, though left unfinished at his death, gives an account of a hero's childhood in Thessaly and concealment on the island of Scyros, it is called the Achilleid.  In the Purgatorio Dante has the shade of this man explain that he secretly embraced Christianity after reading his fellow poet, Virgil's Eclogues.  His greatest work, divided into twelve books depicts the institution of the Nemean Games and focuses on the brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, who hail from the title city.  For 10 point, identify this court poet under the Domitian, the author of the Silvae and the Thebaid.

answer: {Pirenne thesis}

Among the nine main reasons its formulator laid supporting it were the observations that tax collection was disorganized and lending money at interest was prohibited. Its formulator also argued on behalf of the significant achievements of Cassiodorus and particularly Boethius. Britain was exempted from it as was Venice due to their isolation and multiple trade routes respectively. It was introduced in the book Medieval Cities and became crystallized in its formulator's follow-up Mohammed and Charlemagne. Arguing that the break with antiquity and the decline of Western civilization was due not to Germanic invasions but the advance of Islam, for 10 points, identify this theory of European development named for the Belgian historian who proposed it.

answer: It {Happened} One Night

In an early scene in this film a group of drunk men crowd around a phone booth as the hero tells off his employer.  Not long after we meet an annoying character named Shapely who talks incessantly and is fooled into thinking he's become embroiled in a kidnapping plot.  In a memorable sequence the hero teaches the heroine the art of dunking a doughnut after a night spent at Dyke's Auto Camp.  During that night the so-called “Walls of Jericho” scene takes place when the two leads share a room. The majority of this film focuses on the heroine's attempts to reunite with her gold-digging husband King Wesley by traveling from Miami to New York. Newspaperman Peter Warren's attempts to help heiress Ellie Andrews on said journey lead to them falling in love.  For 10 points, name this Frank Capra film starring Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable.

answer: {Lagrangian}

In the A-model of topological string theory, this type of submanifold can be wrapped by a brane. For a symplectic manifold of dimension 2n, a dimension n submanifold on which the symplectic form restricts to zero is said to be this. The submanifold of positions inside a phase space of positions and momenta is of this type, and is related to the object of the same name that is a function of positions and velocities. The one that characterizes general relativity is proportional to the Ricci scalar times a volume form. Equations of motion can be derived by the variational principle from one. The action is the integral of this quantity over time. It is a Legendre transform of the Hamiltonian. For 10 points, what is this difference of kinetic and potential energy, named for an Italian-born mathematician?

answer: {Manetho} (or {Manethon})

This man's no-longer extant writings include works entitled On the Preparation of Kyphi, On Festivals, and Digest of Physics which discussed the symbolism of various animals. His writing is often grouped with his contemporary Berossos, as in a recent translation by Verbrugghe and Wickersham. His hometown is well attested as Sebennytos and he bore a name translating as “keeper of the horses.” The first external reference to him comes in Josephus' work Against Apion, and he probably served as a priest at the temple of Onuris-Shu in the 3rd-century BC. His best-known work describes the origin of the Hyksos and says that Menes ruled for 62 years before being eaten by a hippo. For 10 points, name this great historian who divided Egyptian pharaohs into 30 dynasties.

answer: {Kamala Markandaya}

In one of this writer's works, a clerk named Dandeker embarks on a journey to heal “the growth on his wife's womb.”  Another of this author's works focuses on the divergent paths of two peasant girls, one of whom chooses to remain in her home village while the other runs off to the city.  That work, Two Virgins, was preceded by another work depicting how Richard's ethnicity leads to tension with his love Mira.  In addition to Some Inner Fury, this author explored the perils of modernization in a novel about the newly arrived British engineer Clinton, who loses his young wife Helen, to a man named Bashiam, as he builds the title structure in The Coffer Dams. This writer created such characters as Ravi who struggles to interact with his wife Nalini and his son Raju, after moving to Madras, as well as the long suffering couple Nathan and Rukmani in the 1954 novel that made her name.  For 10 points, identify this Indian author of A Handful of Rice and Nectar in a Sieve.

answer: The {Quest} for {Certainty}

This work posited a distinction between “the satisfying and the satisfactory” and discusses Bergson's comparison of the Parthenon's frieze with the models it depicts to assert that the Greeks privileged the climactic moment of change.  In “The Play of Ideas” it asserts the limitations of an aesthetic stance by providing the example of a visitor to a foreign country who cannot understand why beautifully designed articles are used for instrumental purposes, thus degrading their inherent nature.  It ends with a chapter titled “The Copernican Revolution,” which explores how the scientific method has resolved the opposition between theory and practice.  Subtitled, “A Study of the Relation Between Knowledge and Action,” it was based on its author's 1929 Gifford Lectures and argues for a pragmatic approach to philosophy's titular search for truth.  For 10 points, identify this epistemological work by John Dewey.

answer: “{Our America}” or “{Nuestra America}”

In one section it scolds those who abandon their mother to go sport in “decadent lands.”  It asserts that “the prize in literary contests should not go to the best ode, but for the best study of political factors,” after noting that the struggle is not between civilization and barbarism, as posited by Sarmiento's Facundo, but “between false erudition and Nature.”  This work admonishes leaders that the words of Sieyes or Hamilton will not quicken the blood of the Indian, while its declaration that “there are no races” reflects its author's fight against bigotry during his homeland's struggle for independence. Published in 1891, this work presents the danger of residual colonial influence as a tiger and ends with an image of the Taino deity, Semi, astride a condor, as he sows the seeds of a new utopia from the Rio Grande to the Straits of Magellan. For 10 points, identify this nationalistic essay by Jose Marti.

answer: {Boy} With a {Squirrel} (accept early buzz of {Henry Pelham})

The artist drew on a sketch of the subject from seven years earlier for this painting, whose fame at exhibition led the artist to send his Young Lady with a Bird and Dog to the same exhibition the next year.  Atypical of the artist was the choice of painting in profile rather than head-on and the dreamy quality of the subject, who was the artist's half-brother Henry Pelham.  Of particular note are the luxurious red drapery in the background and the rich mahogany table at which the subject sits.  Upon the table are a glass of water and part of the gold chain which links the subject with the other title figure.  Praised by Reynolds and West upon its London exhibition, it would be surpassed four years later by the artist's portrait of Paul Revere. For 10 points, name this painting by John Singleton Copley depicting an adolescent and a rodent.

James Van Zandt and Hugh Johnson were lesser known figures that were asked to lead this action, which was partly inspired by the French group Croix de Feu. Men that were interviewed in the aftermath of this incident included Albert Christmas and Frank Belgrano, while Grayson Murphy, the treasurer of the American Liberty League, was notably not asked to testify. Robert Clark employed one man involved in this incident, the only conspirator to testify before the McCormack-Dickstein committee. That man, Gerald MacGuire, requested that the author of War is a Racket march 500,000 troops on Washington and become America's “Secretary of General Affairs”. Smedley Butler exposed, for ten points, what alleged plot to install a fascist goverrnment and overthrow Franklin Roosevelt, hatched by some captains of industry?

answer: {Symphony} in {D minor} [accept {Franck's Symphony} before his name is read]

At one point in this work, a third melody, initially played by the clarinet, appears, but is soon ended with a single harp arpeggio.  The first section, which is carried along by a three-note dotted figure that moves down by a semitone and then moves back up again, opens with a chromatic Lento introduction in cellos and basses that is eventually joined by another melody, sometimes known as the “faith” motif.”  Marked “Allegretto,” its second section, particularly the portion which contrasts plucked strings with the main melody in the English horn, initially disturbed many reviewers, who panned its 1889 premiere in Paris.  Composed in three rather than the usual four movements, this piece, its composer's Opus 48, is his only work in a particular format. For 10 points, identify this long orchestral work in a certain key by Cesar Franck.

answer: Talcott {Parsons}

His doctorate examined the concept of capitalism in German scholarship, while during World War II he wrote a series of important monographs on the sociology of Nazism, arguing that they sought to overthrow the enlightenment. He called the gratification of emotions “affectivity”, which he contrasted with a state of “affective neutrality.”  He differentiated between societies that valued action in the correct context versus advancement per se, a distinction he dubbed ascription and achievement. His educational theories emphasized people finding their appropriate occupation in society, an idea that with his students Davis and Moore became the theory of role allocation. His explication of the nature of illness in chapter 10 of The Social System was one of the founding texts of medical sociology. For 10 points, identify this popularizer of Max Weber who analyzed the “unit act” to understand The Structure of Social Action.

answer: {hexagonal} crystal system

Tris(o-phenylenedioxy)cyclotriphosphazine can induce a shift to this structure in other molecules by promoting clathration.  Martensitic transitions to this structure occur in shape metal alloys, and coarse-grained metals with this structure are prone to deformation twinning.  Compression along the C-axis in iron and zinc causes them to deviate more severely from the ideal form of this structure than magnesium, which has a nearly perfect c/a ratio of 1.624.  Because their axes are not orthogonal, these crystal structures are conventionally described by a four-axis system, Bravais-Miller indices.  Like the cubic system, this system has a close-packing crystal structure with a packing factor of 0.74.  For 10 points, name this crystal system used by hematite and graphite in which each atom has twelve equidistant neighbors.

In a historical oddity he was raised by a cousin named John Steinbeck. He went on to serve as a squire to the one-eyed Portuguese knight Vaz da Cunha after having come to the country in the service of Lady Brampton. Within five years he was married to a Miss Gordon, one year after commanding an expedition provided with ships from Maximilian I. His early supporters included Kildare and Desmond, the latter with whom he spent some time in Munster after having aborted his planned invasion at Kent. His wife would end up in the service of Elizabeth of York but he would, after recanting at Westminister and Cheapside, be hung.

answer: {Jennie Gerhardt}

In one scene, the shifting fortunes of the real estate market cost Samuel Ross' partner 50 thousand dollars.  Earlier, the reading of a will by Mr. O'Brien prompts one of the main characters to abandon his post as director of the family carriage company and take a trip to Cairo, where he encounters his one-time flame Letty Pace.  Chapter 38 describes a meeting between Mrs. Sommerville and Mrs. Craig who speculate about the peculiar relationship of a newly arrived couple in Hyde Park.  Earlier the discovery of a toy lamb allows the protagonist to ascertain the existence of Vesta, a child fathered by his partner in Columbus with the deceased Senator Brander.

answer: {Chern}-{Simons} theory

Recently the low-energy theory on a stack of M2 branes has been shown to be a doubled parity-invariant version of it. The Jones polynomial for a knot in a 3-manifold is given by a path integral in this theory of the holonomy of a connection around the knot, as shown by Edward Witten. The topological nature of the theory implies that it is associated with an integer level, and has been used to explain the exactness of the fractional quantum Hall effect. One of its namesakes is a Chinese differential geometer also known for a type of characteristic class for complex vector bundles. Its action is the integral of a three form and its equation of motion says the field strength is zero. For 10 points, what is this theory also named for an American mathematician who founded Renaissance Technologies?

answer: After the {Fall}

In a flashback in this work, a woman calls Ike an idiot for losing his money during the Great Depression, while another scene introduces a woman who is grateful to the main character for helping her secure a divorce.  A key moment occurs when the protagonist recalls the moment his friend Mickey agreed to testify against his client Lou, after the latter has been subpoenaed by Congress.  The opening instruction calls for a single chair to be set in front of a three level tower meant to evoke a concentration camp, which symbolizes a past the prospective third wife, Holga, struggles against.  Much of the play centers on the protagonist's relationship with his second wife, a famous singer named Maggie, who was thought to have been based on the author's ex-wife, Marilyn Monroe.  For 10 points, identify this play with a religious title that traces Quentin's relationships with women, a play by Arthur Miller.
