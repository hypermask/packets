answer: {Genetic Algorithms} (prompt on "{GA}")

A common way to implement one operation in them is named for a roulette wheel, and a proof that one of these can efficiently solve the Two-Armed Bandit problem relies on the Schema Theorem.  Goldberg outlined the "simple" varieties of them, which contrast with the steady state type by replacing a generation at each iteration.  Their optimality can sort of be explained with the much-maligned Building Block Hypothesis.  They were first proposed by John Holland, and usually incorporate crossover and a fitness function to solve problems.  For 10 points, name this type of algorithm that makes use of factors like mutation and inheritance to solve problems in a biologic fashion.

answer: {Paganini's Caprices} or {Capricii}

One of these features a simple yo-yo like path of three descending notes and double stops preceded by what sounds, at first, like a flute and, subsequently, like a French horn.  That work, which was later interpolated in the final movement of Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, was written in E major and nicknamed “The Hunt.”  Another one of these, in B flat major, is nicknamed for a mocking, descending theme that mimics a demonic chuckle.  Later provided with piano accompaniment in works by Fritz Kreisler and Mario Pilati, this group of works opens with a piece marked “Andante in E” and concludes with a set of eleven variations on a twelve bar theme in A minor, that make up the 24th and final one.  For 10 points, identify this series of compositions for the solo violin, the masterwork of Niccolo Paganini.

answer: {Micromegas}

At one point, in this work, a character compares nature to an “assembly of blondes and brunettes,” before he is admonished to stop searching for comparisons and decides to leave his mistress behind.  Another section describes the futility of the Russo-Turkish War, which is cited by the narrator as an example of man's capacity to do evil despite his short life.  Earlier, the protagonist laments that even with a thousand senses he sometimes feels a vague longing, a realization that is followed by a refutation of Father Castel's Treatise of Universal Gravitation and the arrival of two travelers on the northern shore of the Baltic.  Subtitled “A Philosophical Story,” this work in seven chapters opens with a description of a young man from Sirius who is 24,000 “geometrical paces” tall.  For 10 points, identify this satire about a visit to Earth by the title giant, a work by Voltaire.

answer: {efficient markets hypothesis}

Odean's work demonstrating the failure of momentum strategies has lended support for it, while Lesmond et al find that relative strength strategies similarly fail. A key methodology in studying it is the “event study” which as a whole find no systemic over or underreaction biases. Grossman and Stiglitz argued that this idea was paradoxical on the grounds that it would imply that firms had no incentive to improve. Alternatives to this idea have been proposed by Andrew Lo centering around the idea of adaptation. First expressed by Louis Bachelier in his dissertation, “The Theory of Speculation”, its weak version states that prices should reflect all available information, while the strong form asserts that prices also reflect hidden information. For 10 points, identify this economic doctrine espoused by Eugene Fama which colloquially asserts that one cannot consistently beat the market.

answer: {Joseon} or {Chosun} or {Yi} Dynasty

Under its rule, women had to acknowledge their husband, son, and father as their “three lords” and often kept a chastity dagger. Catholics living in this empire's borders were often known as “potters” after having turned to pottery following the Chesa controversy and the resultant Catholic pogroms. Under its greatest ruler, its fleet of Turtle ships grew and the establishment of hangul, the national alphabet, took place. In its second half its power waned and it became known as the Hermit Kingdom, during which time its soldiers notably burned a U.S. ship at Keupsa Gate. Reaching its zenith under Sejong, it was founded by Taejo on the remnants of the Goryeo kingdom. For 10 points, name this dynasty in power from 1392 to 1910 on the Korean Peninsula.

answer: {entropy}

For de Sitter space it is finite, as shown by Gibbons and Hawking, due to the presence of a cosmological horizon. The entanglement version of it measures the amount of correlation between two different subsystems. The conditional version of it incorporates known information and is bounded above by the absolute one. For a classical ideal gas, it scales as the number of particles times the log of the volume, the precise statement of which is known as the Sackur-Tetrode equation. Given the assumption of molecular chaos one can prove the H-theorem of Boltzmann, showing that it increases, as demanded by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. For 10 points, what is this measure of the number of microstates in a system, which is usefully thought of as a measure of disorder?

answer: Thomas {Merton}

He argued that St. John of the Cross' greatest gift was his ability to find joy in emptiness and liberty in suffering.  He corresponded with Louis Massignon on the connections between non-violence and Sufism, while his interest in Buddhism led to a meeting with the Dalai Lama. He reiterated that Saint Thomas declared the contemplative life to be superior to the active life and championed the view of God as Being Itself, an idea he adapted from Etienne Gilson.  His namesake collection which includes such religiously themed books of verse as The Strange Island and Figures for an Apocalypse, is housed at Bellarmine University.  This student of Mark van Doren published a 1948 book that described his conversion and his subsequent life at a Cistercian Monastery at Gethsemani, in Kentucky.  For 10 points, identify this Trappist monk and author of the spiritual autobiography, Seven Storey Mountain.

answer: The {Plot Against America}

Towards the end of this novel the protagonist's family is aided by the Cucuzzas and Mahwinneys in rescuing a childhood friend.  Chapter 6 begins with a letter from Homer L. Kasson outlining the opportunities available to new “homesteaders” under the Office of American Absorption.  One subplot follows the relationship of the narrator's aunt Evelyn and the Rabbi Bengelsdorf, while a key moment occurs when the narrator's parents discover his older brother Sandy's drawings of Burton K. Wheeler's running mate.  Its Postscript, which follows a chapter entitled “Their Country,” describes the true lives of figures such as Walter Winchell and Henry Ford.  Centering on a Newark based family whose lives are turned upside down by the 1940 election of Charles Lindbergh for President, for 10 points, identify this novel, an alternative history about an anti-Semitic United States, written by Philip Roth.

answer: {Skadi} or {Shathi}

A key relationship in the life of this figure mirrors that of Hadingus and Regnhild.  This figure is present at Aegir's feast and interjects during Heimdall's argument to predict that another deity will soon be bound with the entrails of his son.  The Norse analogue of Ull, according to some stories this deity lived at Manheim and fathered the ancestors of the Hladir Jarls with Odin.  Numerous sources assert that it is this deity, who had earlier been made to laugh by an encounter with a goat, who provides the serpent that drips venom on Loki's head.  This figure, who is loath to leave her family abode, Thrymheim, and was often depicted wearing snow-shoes was the daughter of Thiazi. For 10 points, identify this Goddess who selected her husband on the basis of his beautiful feet and thus became the unwilling mistress of Noatun and the consort of Njord.

answer: Titus Flavius Vespasianus

He was raised by his grandmother, from whose silver cup he would drink on festival days, and for a time he was so poor that he dealt in donkeys and was known as “the Muleteer.” He was widowed before coming to power and lived with a freed-slave mistress named Caenis [KYE-niss]. That power was bolstered by the oath of loyalty given by Tiberius Alexander as well as 40,000 archers from the Parthians. However, he owed that power chiefly to the political skills of Mucianus and the military victory at Cremona of Antonius Primus. His reign ended with him saying “Alas, I think I'm becoming a god” on his deathbed and began with the crushing of major revolts on the Rhine and in Judaea and saw the start of construction on the Forum of Peace and the Colosseum, the latter of which was finished by his son. For 10 points, name this father of Domitian and Titus and Roman emperor from AD 69-79.

answer: the {Concord Minute Man} ({make sure} that they {say} the {singular}; prompt on “{Concord}” {monument} or {statue})

Two years prior the sculptor of this work created a 27-inch model that allowed him to easily win approval for this larger work, which was made possible by a donation from the estate of Ebenezer Hubbard. It was based in part on sketches of the descendants of Isaac Davis as well as the artist's viewing of the Apollo Belvedere. The figure depicted has thrown off his coat onto the structure on which his left hand rests and is seen with rolled up shirt sleeves. Two features distinguishing it from nearby copies are the subject's hat and the plow to his left. On the front of this sculpture's base is an inscription that begins “By the rude bridge that arched the flood.” For 10 points, name this sculpture that sits near the Old North Bridge, a work by Daniel Chester French commemorating soldiers of the Revolutionary War.

answer: The {Road} to {Mecca}

Minor characters in this work include the maid Katrina and as it opens a teacher arrives at her friend's house for a surprise visit.  However upon noticing that she isn't prepared, she agrees to go back out to the car and pretends to arrive again.   In another scene the two women discuss the progress made on an elaborate cement sculpture garden that was begun 15 years ago, after one of them became a widow.  Later in this work one of the characters lights the candles spread throughout the setting, an oddly decorated home in New Bethesda, in the heart of the Karoo Desert.  As in another play by its author, A Lesson From Aloes, it is the arrival of a third character, in this case, Pastor Byleveld, that catalyzes the action.  Ultimately, Elsa Barlow, convinces her eccentric friend not to move to a home for the elderly. For 10 points, identify this work that takes its title from Miss Helen's decision to blaze a creative path to a metaphorical Muslim holy site, a play by Athol Fugard.

answer: {Tale} of the {Heike} or {Heike Monogatari}

An invasion of a Mansion by some weasels foretells both joy and sorrow for a former ruler; meanwhile the crash of a tree near the Hill Palace causes a character in this work to command his men to stand ever-ready to shoot the goblins thought to be responsible.  Earlier in this work that same character's cruelty causes the dancing girl Gio to shave her head and become a nun.  Originally divided into twelve chapters, later versions included a secret text known as “The Initiates' Chapter” which focuses on the “Matter of the Six Paths” and tells the story of an Empress' exile.  Other episodes include a Prince leading a fruitless revolt alongside the monks of Miiidera, as well as the execution of the child warrior Atsumori by Kumagae.  Although the ruthless Kiyomori leads the title group to a series of victories in the early chapters, the defeat of  Rokudai at the battle of Dan-no-Ura cements their demise. For 10 points, identify this work set during the Gempei Wars, a Japanese epic that traces the decline of the Taira clan.

answer: {Little Entente}

Its early negotiations were threatened by the attempted rebellion of a man who was exiled to the island of Madeira. Minister Banffy was an infrequent participant in those negotiations, which concluded successfully and twelve years later led to the establishment of an Economic Council, Permanent Council, and Secretariat via the terms of Pact of Reorganization signed by all of its members. This was done at Geneva, which was less important than both the Genoa conference the prior decade and the series of treaties signed with France by all of its members. Intended to suppress Habsburg resurgence as well as Hungarian advances, for 10 points, name this brainchild of Edvard Benes, an alliance between Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia formed in 1920 and 1921.

answer: {Oration} on the {Dignity} of {Man} or On the {Dignity} of {Man} [accept {Mirandola's Oration} before the end] or De {hominis dignitate}

This work cites the Eleusinian Mysteries to illustrate the value of the “liberal arts” before moving on to consult the ideas of Pythagoras.  Its author recalls a banquet at which one of his Hebrew teachers, Dactylus, agreed with the doctrine of the Trinity, while in another section he asserts that he has never sought any pay save the cultivation of his mind.  Written in a series of numbered paragraphs, it opens by restating Abdala the Saracen's response to the question: “what is most worthy of wonder?”  In addition to positing the unity of truth, this work, went beyond such contemporary treatises as Ficino's Theologia Platonica in arguing that the title concept emerges, not only from “universality,” but from an ability to live life based on free choice.  Composed as an introduction to its author's defense of his 900 Theses, for 10 points, identify this humanistic work of philosophy by Pico della Mirandola.

answer: {carbanions}

Silicon-substituted cyclic compounds have been used as “pumps” to generate this class of chemicals in the formation of block copolymers.  Laser flash photolysis of ketoprofenate produces an example of this class of compounds that is unusually unreactive with water.  In unimolecular elimination via the conjugate base, the intermediate is one of these compounds.  Wittig-Horner and Horner-Emmons reactions use resonance-stabilized phosphonate examples of these in place of the phosphonium ylide, and in the first step of the malonic ester synthesis, diethyl malonate is treated with sodium to generate this type of reactive species.  Less substituted examples of these are more stable, and they have the same electron structures as analogous amines, though they are stronger nucleophiles.  For 10 points, name these compounds that contain a trivalent carbon atom with a negative charge.

answer: {Comus}

As it ends a character describes how to ascend above the music of the spheres and confirms his return to the Gardens of Hesperus.  In one section of this work a character asserts that he would follow his antagonist from Africa to India and “drag him by the curls to his foul death.”  In another scene, the coming of a dark cloud covers the stars in the wood and forces another character to sing and beseech Echo for guidance.  During the climactic encounter, two brothers follow the shepherd Thyrsis' advice and attempt to break a glass and seize a “charming rod.”  It ends with the summoning of the river nymph Sabrina who frees the protagonist, a virtuous young lady, from the title figure's spell.  First performed for the Earl of Bridgewater at Ludlow Castle, for 10 points, identify this masque about the son of Circe and Bacchus, a work by John Milton.

answer: {Odalisques} (or {Odaliks})

Lord Leighton depicted one wearing the feathers of a peacock and conversing with a swan. They featured in a series of 1858 photographs by Roger Fenton, and the Louvre is home to James Pradier's sculpture of a “Dancing” one.. Red, black, and white lines and bars characterize Dali's “Cybernetic” one, and Robert Rauschenberg's was a freestanding “combine” parodying the best-known painting of one of them.  Ones with “Upraised Arms,” in a “Green Scarf,” and wearing “Red Trousers” are the most notable of several painted by Henri Matisse.  The best-known is seen in a painting commissioned by Napoleon's sister and drawn partly from Titian's Venus of Urbino.  For 10 points, name these figures also frequently painted by Boucher and Delacroix, female Turkish slaves of which a “Grande” one was painted by Ingres.

answer: {Samuel Jones Tilden}

This son of the “Oracle of New Lebanon” was turned out of one of his earliest offices by James Harper and gained his fortune by managing the merger of the Galena & Chicago Union and Northwestern Railroads.  Although he received partial vindication through the Potter Committee, he was hurt by a series of telegrams obtained from Senator Oliver P. Morton that alleged his staff offered bribes for votes; those were the Cipher Dispatches.  He would later fail to directly challenge a body including Joseph Philo Bradley, who was appointed because the independent David Davis had resigned his position on the Supreme Court.  Earlier, his “Figures That Could Not Lie” report, combined with the efforts of William Wickham, helped bring down a certain “Grand Sachem.”  For 10 points, name this governor of New York who busted the Tweed Ring and went on to lose to Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876.

This man appointed Charles Henningsen as second-in-command, authorizing him to burn large portions of territory. He died after being betrayed by Norvell Salmon, the captain of the sloop Icarus, who falsely promised that his surrender would secure him safe transport home. Early in life, after the death of his deaf fiancée Ellen Martin, he left his career as editor of the New Orleans Crescent to travel to . After that, he conspired with Edmund Randolph to reach a secret agreement with C.K. Garrison and Charles Morgan, aimed at the destruction of the Accessory Transit Company.
