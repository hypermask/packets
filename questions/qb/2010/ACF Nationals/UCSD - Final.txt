answer: {Thomas Reid}

This thinker posited that self-consciousness about deliberating whether or not to do something evidences the existence of moral liberty.  His first publication argued against the ability to measure virtue and was titled “An Essay on Quantity.”  This philosopher's core beliefs were initially popularized in the Essay on Truth, a simplified take on his ideas by James Beattie.  One of his final works, which included such chapters as “The Sense of Duty,” contrasted “speculative power” with “active power.”  This student of George Turnbull, rejected the empiricist reliance on ideas as the basis of knowledge, instead he argued that sensations of an object's primary qualities offer up natural signs to the mind, which are interpreted like words.  For 10 points, identify this philosopher whose works include Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man and Enquiry Into the Mind on the Principles of Common Sense.

answer: {Ising} model

Computing the partition function in the three-dimensional case with a randomly chosen interaction was shown to be NP-hard by a 1982 result of Barahona. The free energy of a two-dimensional square lattice one at low temperature is related to another one at high temperature through Kramers-Wannier duality. Bruria Kaufman used spinor analysis to compute the free energy in the one-dimensional case in 1949, simplifying her advisor's argument. It is defined on a discrete collection of spins, which can be plus or minus one, and gives a simple example of a ferromagnetic phase transition breaking a Z2 symmetry. Invented by William Lenz and given to its namesake to solve, for 10 points, what is this mathematical model of interacting spins, solved exactly in the two-dimensional case by Lars Onsager?

answer: {liquidity trap}

One unorthodox proposed method for dealing with it involves massive foreign currency purchases. Eggertson and Woodford argue that for open-market operations to be effective in this situation requires changing future expectations of policy. Consequently, one approach for dealing with it has been written about by Lars Svenson and involves an explicit central bank commitment to a future price level, also known as nominal GDP targeting. Another method for dealing with this problem is when the Treasury agrees to broaden its asset purchases, termed “quantitative easing.” Paul Krugman has written about Japan's experience in this state, and has argued that the recent economic crisis is an instance of it. Occurring when consumers' preference for cash is greater than the supply of money, FTP, identify this macroeconomist state in which low or zero interest rates fail to stimulate consumer spending.

answer: {Turandot}

One aria in this opera contains two lines from the crowd that help to situate events when a certain figure “unfurled his seven flags.” Emotional peaks in that aria come with such lines as “quel grido e quella morte!,” referencing the “desperate cry” that resounded for a thousand years. In the following act of this opera another female character sings “Tu che di gel sei cinta” amidst unhappier circumstances than her earlier “Signore, ascolta!” to which the man she loves unrequitedly sings back by telling her “don't cry.” At its premier, Toscanini refused to continue on to the ending added by the composer's pupil, Franco Alfano, ending the performance shortly after the scene of Liu's death. For 10 points, name this work in which three riddles are successfully answered by Calaf, who also sings the aria “Nessun Dorma,” the final opera of Giacomo Puccini.

answer: {elliptic} curve

The use of these over finite fields for a type of public-key cryptography was proposed by Koblitz and Miller. Adding a point at infinity allows one to define a group operation that maps two points on it to a third point on it such that all three points are collinear. It discriminant, proportional to 4 A cubed plus 27 B squared when its equation is y squared equals x cubed plus A x plus B, is zero when it is singular. Topologically, it is equivalent to a torus. A conjecture relating them to modular forms was proven in part by Andrew Wiles as part of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. For 10 points, what is this type of algebraic curve, of which the similarly-named conic section that looks like a squashed circle is not an example?

answer: Bela {Kun}

Victor Serge claimed that this man murdered thousands of White Guard prisoners of war as head of the revolutionary committee of Crimea. After leaving his most famous position, he failed to rouse the central German miners to revolution in the so-called “March Action”, and was eventually shot in a gulag in 1938. Although he was imprisoned by the government after a demonstration led by him killed four policemen, he was released after the publication of the Vix Note. Nominally, he was foreign minister under prime minister Sandor Garbai as part of the coalition that overthrew Count Karolyi, but he  clearly held the true power considering his friendships with both Zinoviev and Lenin. Overthrown by the Romanians and replaced by Admiral Miklos Horthy, for 10 points, name this pawn of the Sovet Union who briefly ruled a Communist regime in Hungary in 1919.

answer: {arhats} [or {arahants} or {arihantas}; do not accept “{bodhisattvas}” or “{Buddhas};” prompt on {Tathagata} before mention]

According to scripture, one becomes one of these individuals when they are “released through right gnosis,” and the best known of them says he “beat the drum of the deathless.” One of these figures was entrusted with red and white bibs and caps in his role as overseer of babies' health, and another answered queries posed by Menander I. Two of these figures named Pindola and one named N?gasena are included in a group of sixteen or eighteen of these individuals, one of whom tries to flatter his father by complimenting his shadow after asking that father for his inheritance. Spiritual inheritance was given to Rahula, who thus realized nibbana and abandoned the fetters of materialism, just like his tathagata father, Buddha. For 10 points, name these enlightened beings who mastered spiritualism and serenity in Buddhism.

answer: {Sonic hedgehog homolog} [{SHH}]

Hand2 is an upstream regulator of this molecule.  The disorder HPE3, which is caused by deletions on the long arm of chromosome 7, is due to loss of activity of this gene; that disorder is a type of holoprosencephaly. The secretion of this protein relies upon cholesterol-mediated autoproteolytic cleavage, and it induces the differentiation of floor plate cells. Riddle and colleagues demonstrated that this protein defines the zone of polarizing activity. This protein causes the disassociation of Gli proteins from microtubules by Smoothened when it binds to its receptor, Patched.  While this protein is expressed by the developing notochord and directs neural tube and somite patterning in mammals, related proteins are expressed postnatally in the Sertoli cells and the gut and are known as the “desert” and “Indian” versions. For 10 points, name this embryonic developmental regulator named after a blue Sega Genesis character.

answer: The {Palm Wine Drinkard} or The {Palm Wine Drunkard}

In one section of this novel a man is given a magic net after bringing back a bell from a blacksmith.  This work's narrative occasionally pauses for such section titles as “There Remain Greater Tasks Ahead.”  In addition to meeting “Drum, Song, and Dance,” its hero encounters a “complete gentleman” who it turns out has leased his body parts from traders and is actually just a skeleton living in the ground.  It also features episodes with a wish granting egg, as well as a bush that comes to life.  Its opening section describes the narrator changing into a canoe to allow his wife to cross a river.  Written in pidgin English prose and often published alongside another of its author's works, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, its plot was adapted from Yoruba folktales, and it recounts the title figure's journey to find his recently deceased tapster in “Deads' Town.”  For 10 points, identify this novel by Amos Tutuola.

answer: {Flight Into Egypt} (or {Flight} to {Egypt})

Henry Ossawa Tanner's 1923 version is done in blues and whites and adds a ghost-like figure with a lantern accompanying the usual group. Jean Francois Millet's version is an etching as is Rembrandt's. Oil on coppered silver and an oval frame characterize Adam Elsheimer's main version, which shows the central female in a pink top and blue skirt. Joachim Patinir, unlike in more famous versions, depicted the accompanying stories dealing with corn and statues.  Caravaggio added an angel to the usual three figures and, like Poussin, portrayed them taking a rest. The most famous version has the mule between the two adults and is considered the masterwork of Annibale Caracci.  For 10 points, name this Biblical scene of Joseph, Mary, and the baby Jesus escaping to the titular place.

answer: {Denmark}

One ruler of this nation dismissed the cabinet of his Prime Minister Zahle in an incident known as the Easter Crisis, but he was met with a lack of public support and pledged no longer to interfere in political decisions. A peasant uprising in this country known as the Count's War was initiated by a group under Skipper Clement. This country, which originally established a colony at Tranquebar, was the site of a underground movement during World War II known as its namesake “Freedom Council,” consisting of groups like its Unity Party. Also the birthplace of the wife of King James I of England, this country sold its rights to St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas to the United States in 1917. Governed by the Folketing, for 10 points, name this nation which hosted the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801.

answer: {Gaspard} de la {nuit}

The final portion of this work's middle section, which suggests the influence of Debussy's Homage to Rameau, ends with an instruction that it be played “without expression.”  That section is paced by the soft repetition of irregularly grouped B flats that is meant to evoke the tolling of a bell as the sun sets over the carcass of a lynched man.  This composition opens with a movement that features a shimmering C sharp major figuration contrasted with a soft melody symbolizing the appearance of a deadly water nymph.  Its final section, a scherzo, that features hand crossings and repeated-note figures broken out into octaves, portrays a mean-spirited dwarf, and was composed to be more demanding than Balakirev's Islamey.  Divided into three sections, “Le Gibet,” “Ondine,” and “Scarbo,” for 10 points, identify this 1908 work inspired by Aloysius Bertrand's poems, a work for piano by Maurice Ravel.

One of her daughters caused Orchamus to bury Leucothoe alive; that daughter, Clytia, was the lover of Helius. This goddess is referred to as a “nurse” during the Callisto and Arcas story, where she uses her powers to make their constellations never dip below the horizon and forever circle the sky. In the “Deception of Zeus” section of Book XIV of the Iliad, Hera states that she will visit this goddess and her husband, but instead she makes love to Zeus in a golden cloud. In a rare depiction of this goddess, she bears a golden rudder on her shoulder and wings sprout from her forehead. This godmother of Hera is the mother of the pursuer of Arethusa as well as the mother of Metis and Merope. Credited with birthing all of the important rivers of Greek mythology, for 10 points, name this Titaness, the wife of Oceanus.

Pentostam, Repodral, and other drugs containing this compound preceded modern treatments like Praziquantel in the treatment of helminth infections. The trivalent chloride of this element can catalyze the reaction of aromatic amines with meso epoxides to yield beta-amino alcohols.  This element's amphoteric trioxide is found in valentinite and senarmontite. This element produces a false positive result in the Marsh assays since, like arsenic, it reacts with zinc and acid to produce a black precipitate. George Olah pioneered the combination of this element's pentafluoride with hydrogen fluoride to yield the strongest known superacid. It is commonly used to enhance the hardness of lead, and this Group Five element's sulfide is the ore stibnite. For ten points, name this metalloid, atomic number 51, with symbol Sb.

answer: Battle of {Heraclea}

The losing force at this confrontation had plundered Lucania just before and was temporarily heartened after they fell for a ruse plotted by this battle's winner, who had switched armor with a hapless bodyguard. This battle took place halfway between Pandosia and its namesake location at the River Siris, from which the losing force retreated after war elephants left it vulnerable to a Thessalian cavalry charge. In the aftermath of this battle fought to protect the city of Tarentum, the winning commander was turned back at Anagni after realizing that Barbula's legions might decimate his army. It occurred prior to the Battle of Asculum, where this battle's winning commander remarked “One more such victory and we shall be undone.” For 10 points, name this earliest engagement between the Romans and Pyrrhus.
