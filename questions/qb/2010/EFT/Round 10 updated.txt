answer: {IR} spectroscopy or {Infrared} Spectroscopy

One modification of this technique puts the sample over a zinc selenide crystal and uses attenuated total reflection to analyze the sample in the original phase. Anharmonicity, chemical exchange and hydrogen bond formation and breaking can be detected in the two-dimensional version of this technique, which uses a pair of pulses followed by a detection phase. Samples are prepared by grounding into a mull of nujol or smearing onto salt plates. The area in the readout from 500 to 1500 units is known as the fingerprint region in this technique, and a peak around 1700 wavenumbers is indicative of a carbonyl compound. For 10 points, name this type of spectroscopy that uses wavelengths longer than visible light to probe vibrational modes of molecules.

answer: Crime

Felson and Cohen developed the rational activity theory to describe this behavior, while Robert Reiner argued that it occurs due to narcissism. Park and Burgess showed that this behavior most often occurs at zones of transitions, and Edwin Sutherland's study of this behavior lead to the Differential Association Theory. Leavitt and Donohue argued for an inverse correlation in the rates of legalized abortion and this behavior, and another theory states that structural and individual pressures lead to this behavior, which is a result of anomie; that idea, popularized by Merton, is strain theory. Another work that studied this behavior famously opposed the death penalty and outlined the idea of deterrence.

answer: {Fluorescence}

4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI, shows an increase in this property when bound to DNA. Similarly, tryptophan has this property with an emission peak from 300 nm to 350 nm depending on solvation. This property, with efficiency measured by quantum yield, was named by Stokes in an 1852 paper, which mentions earlier work by Herschel on a quinine sulfate solution that caused light to become "epipolized". Molecular oxygen and iodine can cause quenching, interfering with it, but dynamic quenching can be exploited in FRET. For 10 points, name this property, exhibited by corundum and calcite, which relies on the emission of longer wavelength light from an excited sample and has a longer time-scale than phosphoresence.
