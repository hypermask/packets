answer: {Capital} [Accept {Das Kapital}]

One part of this treatise discusses how “fixed” forms of the title phenomenon include fertilizer, while those used up in a single cycle of production is called “circulating.” It claims that “surplus value” is inserted into goods by the addition of human labor and that this labor is then hidden by the commodity.

This work, published in three volumes, decides that both the division of labor and the desire for surplus value leads to class struggle. For 10 points, name this seminal work, whose first volume was released in 1867, a critical reading of capitalism written by Karl Marx.

The former is Die schöne Müllerin.

answer: {Thin}-{layer} chromatography or {TLC}

Selection of reagents in this technique is often performed using the Prisma model, and for particularly complex samples multiple gradient development is often employed. In far-eastern blotting, this technique precedes a transfer to a PVDF membrane. Adding ninhydrin to the samples in this technique is a method to detect amines. Samples are commonly applied by using a small capillary tube. Commonly used on a panel of analgesics in introductory chemistry classes, this technique can use an iodine vapor as a developer. The retention factor is equal to the sample distance divided by the solvent front distance in this technique. It is also commonly used to separate the components of plant extracts. For 10 points, name this type of chromatography commonly performed on silica gel plates.

answer: {Cholesterol}

ABCA1 and ABCG1 are responsible for pumping excesses of this compound into the bloodstream, and Type C Niemann-Pick disease results in this compound building up in lysosomes. INSIG-1 binding to SCAP is responsible for down-regulating the biosynthesis of this molecule, which is regulated by SREBP-dependent transcription. Esters of this compound are commonly transported by an ApoB100-containing complex, and it can also be transported by chylomicrons. One step in its synthesis is the condensation of acetoacetyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA, which is catalyzed by HMG-CoA synthase, and the step catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited by statins. It contains 4 fused rings, is the precursor for all steroid hormones and bile salts, and regulates membrane fluidity. HDL and LDL are the “good” and “bad” kinds of, for 10 points, this common 27-carbon lipid.

answer: {Standard Deviation}

An approximate unbiased estimator for this quantity is given by a "one over n minus 1.5" estimator. It is invariant to change of location and scales directly with change of scale. Chebyshev's inequality links the distribution function to this quantity for arbitrary distributions, and the stronger "empirical rule" can be used for normally distributed data. Unlike a related measure of dispersion, it takes the same units as the data it describes. For ten points, identify this quantity that for discrete distributions is the root-mean-square distance of values from the mean, the square root of the variance.
