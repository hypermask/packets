answer: {Enantiomers} (accept {chiral compounds} or {chiral centers} or {diasteriomers} until “{mirror}” or mention)

In the Horeau effect, the difference in concentration of two of these is non-linearly related to the rotation. Auxiliaries are used to selectively create one of these over another, and spontaneous resolution and resolution by entrainment are methods of separating them. These entities' namesake excess is the concentration of one of these relative to the other one. Labeling them involves finding the priorities of each constituent of a non-superimposable atom by the CIP-rules. They rotate polarized light, diasteriomers are a less specific designation, and flipping between them involves flipping the designation of each chiral center in a molecule. Racemic mixtures contain two of, for 10 points, these molecules which are mirror images of each other.

answer: {Deuterium} or {H}-{2}

In one experiment, this chemical's incorporation into a protein's amide groups is used as a measure of the solvent accessibility of the residues. The rate-limiting step of an enzyme can be slowed down by the incorporation of this chemical, a process known as the primary isotope effect. Almost all of this chemical was produced during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis and is also produced in the first step of the proton-proton chain. The incorporation of this chemical into acidic positions of a molecule can be monitored by NMR, and solvents for that technique usually contain this chemical since it doesn't show up on proton NMR. Also found in heavy water, for 10 points, name this isotope of hydrogen with atomic mass two.
