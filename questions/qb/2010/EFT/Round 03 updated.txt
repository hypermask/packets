answer: the {hydrogen atom}

The radial part of the state vector for this system is given by a Laguerre polynomial while the angular portion is given by the spherical harmonics. Hyperfine splitting in it results in the 21-cm line, and solving this system requires separating the radial, angular, and azimuthal parts of the Schrodinger Equation. It produces series of lines such as the Paschen, Balmer, and Lyman series, whose energy is proportional to the difference of one over n-squared as given by the Rydberg formula. For 10 points, name this quantum mechanical system which is accurately described by the Bohr Model and consists of one proton and one neutron.

answer: William {James}

He rebutted the moralist views of W.K. Clifford in an essay which categorizes live, forced, and momentous options. He's the first namesake of a theory which states that emotions result from the perception of a physiological stimulus, rather than emotions preceding autonomic responses. One of his essays asks whether a man chasing a squirrel around a tree is by definition “going round” the squirrel. This author of “The Will to Believe” and The Principles of Psychology argued that “truth” is only what is most expedient to believe. He collected his Gifford Lectures at Edinburgh as The Varieties of Religious Experience, and his Lowell lectures were collected as a work which shares its name with a movement started by C.S. Peirce.

answer: {Acetyl} or {Ethanoyl}

Adding two of these chemical groups to morphine results in heroin, and some people are unable to quickly add this chemical group to isoniazid, making normal doses of that drug fatal. The NatB complex is responsible for adding this chemical group to several proteins' N-terminal ends. Sodium butyrate inhibits the removal of this chemical group, and adding it to tubulin is one mechanism of increasing cell motility. It is typically added to lysine residues of histones in order to facilitate transcription by HATs, and it is removed from those proteins by HDACs. It can be added to aromatic systems via the Friedel-Crafts acylation using a two-carbon acyl chloride. Adding it to salicylic acid creates aspirin. For 10 points, name this group with formula COCH3, a methyl single-bonded to a carbonyl.
