answer: Thomas {Jefferson}

This politician advanced the idea of his nation as the “Empire of Liberty”, and one of his letters states that there should be a “Wall of Separation” between church and state. One of the more poetical images this politician created was that of “the tree of liberty” which “must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” He wrote an encyclopedic work that contains his racist views on the inferiority of African-Americans despite his belief in integration. In addition to writing Notes on the State of Virginia, he signed the Embargo Act but he might be better known for designing his estate in the style of Andrea Palladio's buildings. For 10 points, name this historical American statesman that wrote “we hold these truths to be self-evident” as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence.

answer: {Rhodopsin}

Georg Nagel isolated one of these proteins from Chlamydomonas which is linked to a nonspecific cation channel. Deisseroth's group switched out the intracellular domain of one of these proteins with an adrenergic receptor, creating OptoXR. Those proteins, known as the “channel-“ type, are commonly used in optogenetics, while the “bacterio” type is used as a proton pump. This protein, when activated, decreases the concentration of cyclic GMP via the activation of transducin. Its cofactor changes into an all-trans state upon activation of this protein; that cofactor originally adopts an 11-cis confirmation and is known as retinal. For 10 points, name this transmembrane protein found in photoreceptor cells, responsible for converting light energy to cellular signals.

Iara Lee managed to smuggle out footage from this event. Kate Greghart was tasered while attempting to photograph it from onboard the Challenger 1.

Officially known as Operation Sea Breeze or Operation Sky Winds, this event saw the discovery of several weapons on the Mavi Marmara. The United States refused a request from Benjamin Netanyahu to veto any condemnation of Israel after this event.

answer: {Seafloor Spreading}

The fact that the sea level had a highstand in the mid-Cretaceous can be explained by “pulse” in this process. This theory was first tested in measurements attempting to confirm the Vine-Matthews Hypothesis. Arthur Holmes presaged this model by postulating that convection cells could drive this process, which was confirmed by looking at the magnetic striping of rocks around ridges. Harry Hammond Hess helped confirmed this mechanism, which apparently functions more through slab pull than ridge push. This process occurs through upwelling of magma at mid-oceanic ridges, which are accommodated by subduction. For 10 points, name this process that drives continental drift.

answer: Kazuo {Ishiguro}

The title of one of his novels comes from the protagonist's recollection of a song that sparked images of a woman who was told she couldn't have babies, but a miracle happens and she gets one.

He wrote When We Were Orphans, and Judy Bridgewater's Songs of Dark is central to another of his works, which sees its protagonists raised at Hailsham. For 10 points, name this author that wrote about Kathy H. and Tommy being raised to become donors for organs in his Never Let Me Go, who also wrote about the butler Steven and Lord Darlington in The Remains of the Day.

One of his depictions of the last supper includes a hole in the wall from which light streams through. This artist painted two watercolors: one depicting a baby rabbit and the other a patch of grass.

answer: {Pragmatic Sanctions}

A 16th century type of this entity was responsible for reorganization the Seventeen Provinces. The most recent one removed the Infante Carlos from the imperial line but was not repealed before Ferdinand VII died. One of them, which made the Pactum mutuae successionis null, was influenced by a similarly named one issued by the Croatian Parliament. Because it violated Salic Law, Charles Albert and Frederick the Great contested the validity of one of these, leading to a conflict sometimes known as King George's War. For 10 points, identify this type of document, like the 1713 one issued by Charles VI that allowed Maria Theresa to succeed him, leading to the War of the Austrian Succession.

answer: {Pindar}

This author's name is invoked in a poem that begins "Ruin seize thee, ruthless king" that was written by Thomas Gray. One account of this author's death is that he did not write enough poetry to Persephone so he fell asleep and was taken to Hades the next day to write for her. This contemporary of Bacchylides used many meters inspired by his predecessor Stesichorus. One of his poems is addressed to Hippocleas, but much of that poem is a digression on the Hyperboreans and their practice of honoring Perseus. Much of his poetry is on the Isthmian games, the Pythian Games, and the Olympian Games. For 10 points, name this member of the nine lyric poets known for his odes.

One section of this work opens with consecutive descending major sevenths before evoking images of flight, and the opening of this work was originally printed in 11/4 time but is now usually written as alternating 5/4 and 6/4. One version of this work uses a saxophone to represent a troubadour and a tuba solo to depict a sluggish Ox-Cart in “The Old Castle” and “Bydlo” movements respectively. This work, which was inspired by the work of Victor Hartmann, features a repeating “Promenade” movement and closes with “The Great Gate of Kiev.” For 10 points, name this suite which was famously orchestrated by Maurice Ravel, a work about some paintings, written by Modest Mussorgsky.

answer: {Charles Fourier}

Kropotkin's The Conquest of Bread begins by supporting this man's ideas on segregation. He theorized that the society he was creating would lead to an era of 8,000 years of happiness in which androgynous plants would copulate, six moons would orbit the earth, and there would be 37 million humans on earth whose skill rivals Homer. The ideas that he formed were implemented in La Reunion and the New England Community Place. Most of his ideas can be found in his The Theory of the Four Movements, which proposed that humanity would be ruled by an omniarch and live in cities called phalanxes. Influencing people like Robert Owen and George Ripley, for 10 points, name this Utopian theorist from France.

answer: {Joseph II}

Under this ruler, religious toleration was established through the Patent of Toleration, and a single flat tax on land was promoted. His attempts to gain control of Bavaria resulted in the formation of an alliance led by Prussia against him. As result of this opposition, he instead undertook a disastrous war with the Ottoman Empire in conjunction with Russia. His reform policies, including the standardization of German as an official language, the abolition of feudalism, and several attacks on church power, encountered opposition, which was especially strong in Hungary. Consequentially, under his successor, Leopold II, the majority of this man's reforms were repealed. For 10 points name this late 18th century Hapsburg ruler, who succeeded his mother Maria Theresa.

answer: {Electrocardiogram} or {ECG} or {EKG}

A popular guide to this technique was written by Dale Dubin, and a delta wave in this technique is indicative of Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome. In this technique, a readout of right-axis deviation is common in children and those with situs inversus, while left-axis deviation is common in pregnant women. Both the Mobitz II and Wenckebach conditions are commonly detected using this technique, which consists of readouts V1 through V6, readouts aVL, avR, avF and readouts I through III. The Holter monitor is a 24-hour version of this instrument. Each readout in this technique contains a P wave, a QRS complex, and a T wave, and it is commonly used to detect arrhythmias, blocks, and any issues with the Bundle of His. For 10 points, name this medical technique which monitors the electrical signals generated by the heart.

answer: Thoth

He gained popularity when a cult of Khnum worshipped him, which later claimed that it was he who laid the golden cosmic egg that created the world. Some sources claim that this deity has a consort called Astennu, who stood by a lake of fire. This god's epithets include "thrice great" which led to his conflation with Hermes Trismegestus. As part of his most notable role, he was said to be the "tongue of Ra," and he once gambled with the moon to get extra light. This deity is always depicted with a crescent moon headdress, but his head is often depicted in either the form of a baboon or ibis. For 10 points, identify the Egyptian inventor of writing, the god of wisdom.
