answer: {Square planar}

The central carbon atom of fenestranes has this molecular geometry, and reactions of substituents of complexes with this geometry are greatly accelerated when the trans ligand is a good pi acceptor. In crystal field theory, the d-orbitals of these complexes are split into four levels, giving it larger stabilization energy than the octahedral configuration. This geometry is occupied by low-spin d-8 complexes like Vaska's complex, the chemotherapy drug cisplatin, and a hydrogenation catalyst with a central rhodium atom and a series of triphenylphosphine ligands named for Wilkinson. According to VESPR, xenon tetraflouride occupies this configuration since it has 2 lone pairs and 4 ligands. For 10 points, name this molecular geometry which is flat with four sides.
