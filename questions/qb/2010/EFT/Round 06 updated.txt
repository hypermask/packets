This molecule, which belongs to the D sub infinity h symmetry group, is used as a solvent in decaffeination reactions. The Keeling Curve gives the concentration of this molecule in the atmosphere. Removing this molecule from histidine gives histamine, and adding it to a solution of Grignard reagents is a common carboxylation method. It's a linear molecule with two double bonds, and it is the primary cause of global warming. For 10 points, name this gaseous molecule which is present in soft drinks and which humans exchange for oxygen.

answer: {Gravitational Waves}

One method to detect these phenomena is a 68 centimeter sphere cooled to 20 millikelvin, while another one designed by Thorne, Drever, and Weiss consists of an L-shaped Michelson interferometer with Fabry-Perot cavities. Besides the miniGRAIL experiment, another apparatus used to detect them is a series of aluminum cylinders isolated from outside vibrations, named for Joseph Weber. The orbital decay of the Hulse-Taylor binary system is predicted to be due to these phenomena radiating energy away from the system, and they are radiated by accelerating, non-spherically or cylindrically symmetric system. The LIGO experiment attempts to detect, for 10 points, these phenomena predicted by general relativity.

answer: {Splicing}

In whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing data, the TopHat algorithm can be used to find instances of this process. Removal of one site for this process is responsible for diminished production of functional SMA protein in spinal muscular atrophy, and some mutations can activate cryptic sites for this process. This process consists of a series of two transesterifications, and relies on binding of the U1 through U6 components of a certain complex to the branch point and polypyrimidine tract. Those small nuclear riboproteins are responsible for the formation of a lariat intermediate, which is then removed. This process allows more than one protein to be coded for by a single gene. For 10 points, name this process of removing introns from an immature mRNA transcript.
