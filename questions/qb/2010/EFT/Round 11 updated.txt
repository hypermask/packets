Phenylacetate and benzoate are used to clear this compound from the blood in patients with ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency, and sodium metal is dissolved in the liquid form of this compound in order to perform the Birch reduction. Its liquid form glows blue due to electron salvation, and a common method of producing it uses an iron catalyst to adsorb diatomic nitrogen; that process is the Haber process.
