One work by this figure was the inspiration for the Kaufmann head at the Louvre. The Ruspoli faun is a copy of a statue type attributed to this figure.

He depicted that same figure standing next to a lizard crawling up a tree, while in another work, which was supposedly modeled on the courtesan Phryne, shows a nude woman holding her hand in front of her genitals. Another work shows a god holding a robe and a baby on his left hand.

The influence of Jan Smuts can be seen in this thinker's ideas of holism, which can be found in his Social Interest: A Challenge to Mankind. This man's theories were used to explain why adolescents “act out” in pursuit of “mistaken goals” by Rudolf Dreikurs.

answer: {Serotonin} or 5-HT or {5}-{Hydroxytryptamine}

One class of antagonists of this compound's receptor is used to treat the nausea associated with chemotherapy, and carcinoid syndrome occurs when tumors secrete this compound excessively. In the hepatic portal vein, platelets commonly sequester this compound. This compound's production is dependent on TPH1 in the pineal gland and TPH2 in the Raphe nuclei. LSD agonizes this compound's 2A receptor, and this compound is most abundantly produced in the enterochromaffin cells of the GI tract. It breaks down into 5-HIAA in the liver via monoamine oxidases, and this neurotransmitter's effects can be enhanced by Celexa and Zoloft, which block this compounds reuptake. Synthesized from tryptophan and also known as 5-HT, for 10 points, name this neurotransmitter whose levels are lowered in depression and anxiety disorders.

answer: {Madrigal}

A nineteenth-century example of this form is “Brightly dawns our wedding day,” by Arthur Sullivan. Another English specimen is “April is in my mistress' face” by Thomas Morley, while Ligeti wrote a set of “Nonsense” ones, but it is better known as an Italian style. Though it was originally polyphonic, some composers developed this form into an accompanied solo piece, with Giulio Caccini's “Amarilli, mia bella” being an example. Books of these were written by Carlo Gesualdo and Claudio Monteverdi; one of Monteverdi's collections is “of War and Love.” They often involve word-painting and refrains to words like “Fa la la.” For 10 points, name this form of secular vocal music of the Baroque and Renaissance eras.

answer: {p orbital} (prompt on {orbitals}, {atomic orbitals}, {molecular orbitals}, etc)

The band structure of graphene originates from the dispersion of these constructs across the honeycomb structure, and these entities have angular momentum of h-bar. The angular wavefunction of these entities is quantity 3 divided by four pi to the one-half power, and they contain n minus 2 radial nodes and a single angular node. Carbenes have an empty one, a series of overlapping ones is responsible for the delocalization in both conjugated and aromatic systems. Their azimuthal quantum number is equal to 1, and for each principal quantum number there exist three mutually perpendicular ones of these. They overlap to form pi bonds, look like dumbbells with no density at the origin, they can hold 6 total electrons. For 10 points, name these atomic orbitals that are more energetic than s orbitals and less energetic than d orbitals.

answer: {Mapp} v. {Ohio} [or {Ohio} v. {Mapp}]

The plaintiff in the case overturned by this one was convicted of conspiring to perform abortions. It incorporated the right upheld in Weeks v. U.S. against the states, and did not deal with the issue that later arose in Miller v. California, although the plaintiff had been convicted of possession of obscene material. Overturning Wolf v. Colorado, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment protection from “unreasonable searches and seizures” was violated when evidence seized without a warrant was used against her in court. For 10 points, name this case, which mandated in all criminal cases the use of the exclusionary rule.
