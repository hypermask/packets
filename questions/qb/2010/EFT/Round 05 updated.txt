answer: {Amines}

Both methyl orange and methyl red contain a diazo bridge para to one of these functional groups. Benzenesulfonyl chloride is used in a chemical test to detect this functional group named for Hinsburg, and a method of removing this functional group involves adding excess methyl iodide and heat. A popular method of synthesizing them involves the addition of an alkyl halide to potassium phthalamide. Adding one of them to formaldehyde is the first step of the Mannich reaction, and the previous reactions are the Hofmann elimination and Gabriel synthesis. Quaternary ones carry a positive charge, and aniline is a simple aromatic one. Primary, secondary, and tertiary ones have a lone pair. For 10 points, name this functional group which contains a nitrogen atom single bonded to carbon chains.

answer: {O}({1}) run time or {constant} run time

This is the run time of a lookup operation of an element when using a Bloom Filter. When efficiently implemented using up-trees, the find function in a disjoint set makes look-up times for elements of a given set be this. Linked lists are often implemented in lieu of arrays because insertion into one has this run time on average with a linked list, even though directly accessing an individual array element has this run time. Also the run time of all bitwise operations, it is also the run time for a function that makes use of a “bucket array.” For 10 points, identify this big-O run time that is the average look-up time for hashes, a run time that does not change with respect to any given property.

answer: {stress} (accept {tension due} to {ambiguities})

In cardiology, the value of this parameter increases with radius and decreases with wall thickness according to Laplace's Law. Knowing three vectors for this quantity in mutually perpendicular planes at a point allows for it to be calculated for any plane through that point according to Cauchy's theorem. Cauchy also lends his name to the second-order tensor used to represent this quantity, which has the normal ones on the diagonal and the shear ones off the diagonal. This value can be represented by Lame's ellipsoid but more commonly the normal and shear components are plotted against each other to find Mohr's circles. When this value passes the yield point, deformation occurs, and the ratio of it to strain is given by Young's modulus. Like pressure, it is represented as force per unit area. For 10 points, name this measure of the intensity of forces acting on a deformable, solid body.

answer: {Urey}-{Miller} experiment

Johnson and Pratt re-analyzed the original samples from this experiment and found hydroxylated products. This experiment immediately preceded Sydney Fox's experimental discovery of proteinoid microspheres, and Roscoe Stribling repeated this experiment with one of the original scientists.
