answer: {Diels}-{Alder} Reaction

EJ Corey's total synthesis of Tamiflu begins with one of these reactions, and most norbornene derivatives are synthesized using this reaction. Niobium-5-Chloride is used to activate molecules for this reaction, and dendralene has the ability to undergo this reaction several times in tandem. Maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene undergo this reaction very quickly since the former has electron-withdrawing groups and the latter is locked in the s-cis confirmation. The LUMO of one reactant and the HOMO of the other has to overlap correctly in this reaction, which occurs preferentially in the endo confirmation. It is a 4+2 cycloaddition that occurs in a single, concerted step, and creates a cyclohexene derivative. For 10 points, name this organic reaction in which a diene reacts with a dienophile.

answer: {Stanford Prison} Experiment

Christina Maslach played a role in the conclusion of this experiment, which was partially under the guidance of Robert Blass.

The experimenter found himself being drawn into the role of “Supervisor” as much as the subjects of the experiment found themselves identifying with their roles of either “Guard” or “Prisoner”.

answer: {quasars} (or {quasi}-{stellar radio sources}, {also} accept {BL Lac objects}, {Blazars}, {OVVs}, or {Seyfert Galaxies}; prompt on {Active Galactic Nuclei} before mention)

Many recent studies have sought to pinpoint ‘dust-reddened' ones of these through LoBALs, or broad absorption lines. Neutral hydrogen clouds create a characteristic suppression in their spectra in the Gunn-Peterson Effect. They were first discovered by Marten Schmidt, and Einstein's theory of gravitational lensing was first confirmed by one of them. Their spectral energy is believed to arise from large amounts of matter falling into regions of extreme gravity. Characterized by very high redshifts and believed to be powered by supermassive black holes, for 10 points, identify these super-powerful active galactic nuclei.
