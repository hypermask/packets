answer: {Parkinson's} Disease

Mutations in dardarin have been linked to some hereditary cases of this disease. One drug used to treat this disease is administered with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor in order to increase its half-life. One new treatment for this disease is deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus interna. MPTP was linked to several instances of this disease in opiate addicts, and this disease is caused by a buildup of ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy Bodies, which destroy the substantia nigra. Important symptoms of this disease include micrographia, cogwheel rigidity, and a mask-like facial expression. Commonly treated by L-Dopa, for 10 points, name this neurological disorder which causes impaired motor skills and eventually dementia, named for a British scientist.

answer: grammatical {mood} [accept {modality} until “{energetic}”]

This concept's two main divisions are realis and irrealis, the former of which includes the “energetic” one. This concept is considered one way to express another concept broken up into alethic and deontic types, and evidentiality was once treated as a subset of this category. Latin uses a more common one of these to represent the hortative and jussive ones for first and third person, respectively. Oddly, Greek used the optative one to express wishes. One of these has fallen into disuse in English and uses “were” in the singular, while another expresses commands. For 10 points, name this grammatical category, examples of which include imperative, subjunctive, and indicative.

answer: {sublimation}

A group at Penn State recently created sheets of graphene from silicon carbide using this process. The primary drying phase of lyophilization occurs via this process since the pressure of the sample is lowered, and in most laboratory syntheses of ferrocene, the final product is purified using this process. Napthalene undergoes this process at room temperature, and in most laboratory apparatuses for performing this technique, it occurs on the surface of a cold finger. This process occurs at pressures and temperatures less than the triple point, and the enthalpy of this process is the sum of the enthalpies of fusion and vaporization. The opposite of deposition, for 10 points, name this process that occurs in solid iodine and dry ice, the direct transformation of a solid to a gas.

Anomalies in this phenomenon include the South Atlantic Anomaly and the Kursk Anomaly, and every few million years it undergoes reversals, which can be seen in the geological record. Its shape is dictated partially by its interaction with the solar wind. For 10 points, name this phenomenon which arises due to currents in the outer core, whose strength is on the order of microteslas.
