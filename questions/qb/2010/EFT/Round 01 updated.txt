answer: {Telomeres}

Facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy is believed to be caused by these structures' namesake position effect,  which Baur et al showed could be relieved by Trichostatin A. Their size can be assayed via Flo-FISH or a TRF southern blot, and they are protected from non-homologous end-joining by the shelterin complex. The SIR2/3/4 complex relocates to these structures, which form G-quadruplexes in humans. Their existence solves the end-replication problem, and Greider and Blackburn discovered a reverse transcriptase that lengthens these structures. Their length sets an upper limit upon the number of divisions that a given cell can undergo, and they consist of the sequence TTAGGG. For 10 points, name these ends of chromosomes.
