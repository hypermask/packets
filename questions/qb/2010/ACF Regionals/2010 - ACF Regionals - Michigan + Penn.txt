answer: {Dirichlet}

One theorem named for this man states that the group of units of a ring is finitely generated, and one function named for this man has a pole at s=1 if chi is a principal character. Another theorem named for this man states that there are an infinite number of rational numbers p over q within one over q squared of any given irrational number, a result known as his diophantine approximation theorem. His namesake statistical distribution is the conjugate prior of the multinomial distribution, and his original proof of his namesake theorem on arithmetic progressions of primes used his L-functions, which are also used to generalize the Riemann hypothesis. He gives his name to values that solutions of a partial differential equation, but not their derivatives, must take on a border, known as his namesake boundary conditions.

answer: {Mossbauer} effect

Spectral lines generated by this effect are moved when one nuclear isomer is replaced by another, and in order for this effect to occur E sub R must be less than one-half of the linewidth for the corresponding transition. Spectral lines of molecules undergoing this effect display a characteristic namesake "wing". One quantity important in this effect is equal to the exponential of a polynomial involving the absolute value of the scattering vector q, and gives a ratio of transitions via this effect to purely resonant transitions, known as the Debye-Waller factor. Originally discovered in a block of Iridium, this effect was used via a pair of samples of iron attached to loudspeakers in order to prove the existence of gravitational redshift by Pound and Rebka. For 10 points, name this effect in which solid atoms absorb and emit gamma rays in a recoil-free manner, named for a German.

answer: production {possibility frontier} [accept {production possibility curve}]

In the context of a Hecksher-Olin model, fixed factor prices will lead to the long-run version of this being piecewise linear, and equal to the Rybszynski line. Heavy dominance of economies of scale can lead to a convex one of these, and similar inputs can lead to a linear one of these, but it is normally concave due to opportunity costs, and output bundles are allocatively efficient when they are on this line. Its most stereotypical presentation involves two goods which are chosen as metaphors for national security and domestic goods. Guns and butter are often used to illustrate, for 10 points, this basic economics curve which shows the limits of efficient production for various combinations of two goods.

In plants, production of this chemical via P450 mono-oxygenase helps eliminate poisonous ammonia. The enzyme catalyzing this compound's production depends on biopterin and is found in large abundances in Raphe neurons. Myo-inositol in consumed foods serves to modulate activity of this neurotransmitter. In the body, about 80% of this neurotransmitter in the body is synthesized by the gut's enterochromaffin cells. Both MAOI and TCA therapies parallel a current method of treating depression by increasing extracellular levels of this tryptophan derivative also known as 5-HT. For 10 points, name this neurotransmitter regulating mood and appetite whose reuptake is selectively inhibited by anti-depressants like Prozac and other SSRIs.

answer: {hydrogen bonds} [or {H}-{bonds}]

Gilli's studies of the transition state forms of these entities employed their resonance-assisted versions in 1-(X-phenylazo)-2-naphthols. The migration of a proton along one of these provides one step in Grotthuss diffusion, which helps explain why they are grouped with related oscillating ion interactions. These interactions can form clathrate-like cages to separate two types of molecules. They occur over a range of 2.2 to 2.5 Angstroms in their short-strong or low-barrier forms, and these interactions occur between i and i+4 positions on alpha helices. Stabilization via these interactions explains the low density of ice. For 10 points, name these strong covalent interactions typically occurring between fluorine, nitrogen, or oxygen and the namesake element.
