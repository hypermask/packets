answer: {crystal} field theory [or {CFT}; prompt on {ligand field theory} or {LFT} until "{bonding}"]

One type of energy important in this theory is directly proportional to the mean of the fourth power of a certain radius and inversely proportional to the fifth power of another radius, and a normalized version of it is found on the x-axis in a Tanabe-Sugano diagram; that energy is its namesake stabilization energy. This theory, which unlike a similar theory does not attempt to describe bonding, states that nonbonding electrons on negative ligands cause the d-orbitals in a cation to split into e-sub-g and t-sub-2g orbitals, which explains the colors exhibited by coordination complexes. It is combined with molecular orbital theory to form ligand field theory. For 10 points, name this model of chemistry, developed by Hans Bethe, which explains the electronic structure of d-block metals.

answer: The {Vendee} Revolt/War/Etc.

This event saw the popularization of a flag contained a heart with a cross poking out of it, and it earned the epithet of "the Butcher" for Francois Joseph Westermann. It began with the formation of a "Catholic Army" before suffering a notable defeat at the Battle of Cholet, and unlike the similarly-motivated Chouans, drew most of its support from urban areas. This event saw an expedition to capture Granville and meet reinforcements from Britain led by Henri de la Rochejacquelin, though it ended in his execution. General Hoche's conciliatory gestures including the restoration of a few priests helped diffuse tensions from this event, which was mostly centered on the coast near the mouth of the Loire River. For 10 points, identify this 1792 insurrection against the French republican government by citizens loyal to the church and king, named for a region in Western France.

answer: {Helios}

One son of this god was so good at science that his brothers Macar, Actis, Triopus, and Candalus murdered him. This deity's cult was centered almost exclusively on the island of Rhodes, although the Etruscans worshiped a version of him named Usil. This father of Tenages entrusted some sacred animals to his daughters Lampetia and Phaethusa, who guarded them on Thrinacia. After this god was fired upon, he agreed to cede a golden cup to Heracles. Zeus's destruction of Odysseus's ship was prompted by his men eating the cattle of this deity. Later, this deity anointed his son with a magic oil, but was unable to prevent him from blackening the skin of the Ethiopians by failing to control the horses Pyrios, Aeos, Aethon, and Phlegon. For 10 points, name this chariot-riding father of Phaethon, an early Greek god of the sun.

answer: magnetic {moment} [accept {electron charge} or {fundamental charge} before the first mention of "{charge}"]

The radiation emitted during orbital-electron capture is a consequence of the disappearance of the charge and of this quantity. Taking the cross product of this quantity with the position vector and dividing it by the absolute value of the position vector cubed yields a quantity proportional to the dipole vector potential. The quantum of this quantity is given by the fundamental charge times h-bar over the quantity two times electron mass times the speed of light. As an adiabatic invariant, the conservation of this quantity results in the creation of a namesake bottle used in plasma confinement. One of these will precess about an applied field with the Larmor frequency, and the torque on a current loop is given by the cross product of this quantity with the magnetic field. Quantized in units of the Bohr magneton, for 10 points, identify this vector quantity which gives the magnitude and direction of an object's magnetic field.

answer: State of {Franklin}

Landon Carter served as Secretary of State of this polity, whose "Holston Constitution" prohibited office holders from being doctors or lawyers. This polity suffered an economic disturbance after its tax collectors cheated by sewing raccoon tails onto opossum hides. John Tipton arrested one of the leaders of this polity after a skirmish, but that leader soon escaped and led an expedition against the Overhill Cherokee towns. Anger over the Hopewell Treaty led to consultations with the Spanish Empire about annexation of this polity, but land reforms by the North Carolina government sapped its support.

answer: {Goldbach's} Strong {Conjecture}

Utilizing the circle method, Hardy and Littlewood proved the weaker version of this statement, though their proof required the grand Riemann hypothesis to be true. Vinogradov provided a direct proof of its weak version, a result similar to Levy's statement. Chen Jing Run used a weighted sieve method that improved on the work of Brun and Selberg to give a new upper bound for this problem. This statement is equivalent to the claim that for every positive integer m, there exist primes p and q such that phi of p plus phi of q equals two times m, where phi is the totient function. The aforementioned weak version states that every odd number greater than 7 can be written as the sum of three odd primes. For 10 points, identify this unproven statement whose strong version states that every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes.
