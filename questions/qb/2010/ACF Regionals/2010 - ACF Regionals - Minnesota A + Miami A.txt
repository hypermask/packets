answer: Jack London

This author wrote about a man who assassinates General Juan Alvarado before winning a boxing match against Danny Ward in "The Mexican". Another work by this author describes the Nashville Massacre, where eight hundred weavers were killed, and is written as the manuscript of Avis Everhard, who tried to sabotage "The Oligarchy". This author of The Iron Heel wrote about a man who ignores the warnings of the "old-timer on Sulphur Creek" and freezes to death after a tree dumps snow on his work. The protagonist of another novel defeats Spitz to become leader of a team before the Yee-hat Indians kill his master, John Thorton.

answer: {War Requiem}

In this work's second section, the cymbal, flute, and violins play quietly while the tenor whispers, "Move him into the sun". The first movement introduces the recurring tritone between C and F-sharp. The penultimate movement consists of alterations between excerpts from the B-minor and C-major scales, ending with the hushed chorus holding the final syllable of "sempiternam". The boys chorus quotes from the composer's earlier canticle Abraham and Isaac at the beginning of the "Offertorium". At the end of this work, the baritone and tenor converge to sing "let us sleep now" before all three sections of the chorus join to repeat "requiescant in pace". Commissioned for the reconsecration of the Coventry Cathedral, for 10 points, name this choral mass featuring the poetry of Wilfred Owen, composed by Benjamin Britten.

answer: {karyotyping} [accept word forms]

Carle and Olson developed an "electrophoretic" version of this technique that involved orthogonal field alternation. Though it has nothing to do with clinical trials, another form of this technique has "3+3", "2+3", and "3+2" types, where the second number indicates the number of haptene-labeled probes. Visualization methods in this technique include the "trypsin-Giemsa", or "G-banding", technique. Cells used in this technique must be treated with colchicine so that they can be arrested in metaphase. In normal humans, this technique visualizes a set of 46 genetic structures. For 10 points, identify this technique used during pregnancies to screen for fetuses having chromosomal abnormalities, which produces an ordered plot of an individual's chromosomes.

answer: The {Poor} Law {Amendment Act} of 1834 (or {PLAA}) or the {New Poor} Law [do not accept {Old Poor Law} or {Poor Law} of {1601} or {Elizabethan Poor Laws}]

This legislation established the Consolidated General Order to oversee a system modeled on John Becher's work at Southwell, and it was protested by Joshua Hobson's Murder Book. Driven by Edwin Chadwick's reading of a sensationalist Mark Peters article and by the violent Swing Riots, this legislation scrapped the failed Speenhamland and pro-human auctioning Roundsman systems. This bill sought to correct the failed modifications proposed by Knatchbull and Gilbert for a 1601 law, and tragically discouraged one action's "outdoor" form. The Andover scandal resulted from the ensuing bureaucratic war zones created by legislation, whose "less illegibility" provision actually banned tolerable conditions in workhouses. Passed two years after the Great Reform Bill and inspired by the ideas of Bentham, and Malthus, for 10 points, identify this 1834 legislation that ended up starving and killing rather than aiding many of its namesake impoverished Britons.

answer: {infinity} [accept word forms, prompt on {divergence}]

In tokamaks in which a separatrix exists, the safety factor obtains this value at the separatrix. By analyzing the two-dimensional Ising model, Kramers and Wannier established that the specific heat took on this value at the Curie point. This value is obtained when computing the occupancy number for the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate, and classical calculations of electron self-energies also yield this value. In quantum field theory, terms having this value are removed through the process of renormalization, and this value is also obtained for the energy radiated by a black body when extrapolating the Rayleigh-Jeans law to higher frequencies. For 10 points, identify this value attained by the classical metric of general relativity at the singularity of a black hole, in which things get unquantifiably large.

answer: Zebulon Montgomery {Pike}

According to legend, this man would hide in the bushes to see whether his soldiers were drinking. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft proved that this man made a mistake in naming Leech Lake as the source of the Mississippi River. This man's papers were confiscated by Nemesio Salcedo, who was convinced he was spying on New Spain. This man coined the name "Great American Desert" for the region he most famously explored. He died while leading an amphibious assault on York during the War of 1812. An expedition led by John Fremont later named what this man called "Grand Peak" after him. For 10 points, give this "Lost Pathfinder" and namesake of the Rocky Mountains peak that allegedly inspired the song America the Beautiful.

answer: The {Structure} of {Scientific Revolutions} [prompt on "{SSR}"]

The author of this work included "values", "symbolic generalizations", and "exemplars" among the components of the "disciplinary matrix", a concept introduced in this work's 1969 postscript to clarify its central concept. This work's insistence on N.R. Hanson's idea of the theory-dependence of observation led to its argument that the holism of meaning is shared by both theoretical and observational terms, leading to the first appearance of its author's semantic incommensurability thesis. This work posits that "puzzle-solving" makes up most of the process of "normal science" and asserts that the accumulation of "anomalies" leads to a "crisis", which is eventually resolved by a "paradigm shift". For 10 points, identify this 1962 monograph by Thomas Kuhn.

answer: Peter Paul {Rubens}

This artist showed Alekto dragging Mars out of the Temple of Janus as he stomps on a book representing the arts in The Consequences of War, which is paired with The Allegory on the Blessings of Peace. He featured a fountain with water spouting out of the breasts of a statue of Diana on the right side of a painting that shows him dancing with Helene Fourment. He painted Saturn lifting Veritas up to heaven in The Triumph of Truth, which is the last work in a series including The Disembarkation at Marseilles and Louis XIII Comes of Age. This artist of The Garden of Love painted a cycle based on the life of Marie de Medici. For 10 points, name this Flemish painter of The Descent from the Cross known for his voluptuous nudes.

answer: The {Trial} [or {Der Prozess}]

At one point in this novel the protagonist refuses to pick up a dusty copy of the novel How Grete was Plagued by her Husband Hans. In another episode the main character opens a door to find Willem and Franz being beaten by The Whipper. The servant Leni takes a liking to this novel's protagonist, who fires the advocate Huld before buying three identical canvases from the painter Titorelli. In this novel's penultimate section, a priest recites a parable about a man who accepts a command not to travel through the door to the law; and this book begins with two men waking the protagonist to inform him he is under arrest. For 10 points, name this novel in which Joseph K is arrested for an unknown crime by Franz Kafka.

answer: Elias James {Corey}

Along with Eduardo Martinez, this man developed the first large-scale process to synthesize the anti-cancer drug Ecteinascidin. A lactone named for him is the precursor to several prostaglandins for which he developed total-synthetic routes. This man's namesake ylide is used in a reaction converting a carbonyl to an epoxide, which is co-named for this man and Michael Chaykovsky. A reaction in which terminal alkynes can be produced by the homologation of an aldehyde through a triphenylphosphine is co-named for this American chemist of Lebanese descent and Philip Fuchs. For 10 points, name this 1990 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, a professor at Harvard best known for his contributions to retrosynthetic analysis.Â

answer: {Lepidoptera}

A popular model organism in this order is Manduca sexta. This order can be divided, based on the relationship between the ovipore and copulatory pore in females, into montrysians, exoporians, and ditrysians. Organisms in this order have four wings, each of which are covered in scales. Some organisms in this phylum can synthesize hydrogen cyanide. One species in this order, Biston betularia, exhibited a marked shift in the ratio of its light and dark forms during the Industrial Revolution. Larvae in this order include tent worms, armyworms, and inchworms, as well as the most common form, caterpillars. For 10 points, giant silk worms and monarchs belong to which order of insects consisting of moths and butterflies?
