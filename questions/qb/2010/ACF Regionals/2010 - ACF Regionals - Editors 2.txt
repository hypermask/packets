answer: {inner} product

The Hermitian variety of this operation is a complex-valued bilinear form in which reversing the order of arguments of this operation is equivalent to taking a complex conjugate of this operation's result. A common example of this operation for the space of square-integrable real-valued functions is the integral of the product of two such functions from minus infinity to plus infinity. Hilbert spaces are vector spaces on which this operation is defined such that the norm results in a complete metric space. For 10 points, identify this binary operation which maps two elements of a vector space to an element of the underlying scalar field, as exemplified by the dot product in Euclidean spaces.

In the background of this painting, a priest, grave digger, and prostitute stand together in a group the artist called "the exploiters, people who make a living from death", while the presence of a rabbi on the far left has been left unexplained. In the center of this painting, a contorted male nude figure standing above a skull was inspired by Jusepe de Ribera. A black feathered hat lies next to a guitar and dagger representing the inadequacy of academic art. The central figure looks away from a semi-nude female standing next to him who represents the Platonic ideal of beauty. On the right side of this painting, George Sand and Charles Baudelaire are among the figures looking at the painter in the center of the canvas, who works on a landscape in the title location.

answer: {Chile}

Toro Zambrano was forced to join this country's independence movement after his colleagues abruptly jumped up on tabletops and began shouting "we want a junta!", while its tradition of nefarious coups can be traced to the Conspiracy of the Three Antonios. It briefly devolved into an anarchic kleptocracy known as "war to the death" period that saw the Pincheira brothers pilfer almost 10% of its total material wealth. This country's patria vieja ended after Mariano Osorio's forces were crushed when Rafael Maroto ordered the Talaveras regiment to hurl itself at an entrenched position. This site of the Figueroa Mutiny and the Battle of Rancagua weathered the Tanquero uprising and the Cuban Packages scandal before its president, Salvador Allende, was deposed by Augusto Pinochet. For 10 points, name this country historically ruled with fluctuating stability from Santiago.

An early interpretation of this text was created by Zhou Gong Dan. Tradition holds that Confucius wrote a commentary on this text called the Ten Wings. This text frequently uses the symbol of a dragon to represent actions taken by great men. The Duke of Kau wrote six paragraphs of commentary on each of the diagrams contained in this text, while King Wan wrote only one for each. Although interpretation of this text was traditionally done at first with straws, more modern interpretations frequently use coins. The arrangement of those diagrams was created by Fu-Hsi, and the first of them, the Khien, describes the proper time for action and waiting. For 10 points, name this ancient religious text often used for divinations, composed of sixty-four hexagrams.

answer: {Janos} [or {John}] {Hunyadi}

This man expanded his ancestral home from the Fearless Tower into a gilded status symbol in an attempt to appease the nobility, erecting the imposing Capistrano tower, named after the elderly monk who had fought in support of this man's major victory. His time serving with George Podebrady as regent for Ladislaus the Posthumous kicked off a long-standing feud with Ulrich Celje, and he was humbled after Julian Cesarini convinced him to derail the Peace of Szeged. Skanderbeg revolted after deserting when this man's Long Campaign ended with a victory at Nis, and he later nearly beat Murad II before Vladislaus III charged into a huge wall of janissaries and was hacked apart. This loser at Second Kosovo was celebrated by the Noon Bell for breaking the Siege of Belgrade, repelling Mehmet II and inspiring his son to form the Black Army to battle the Ottomans. For 10 points, name this father of Mathias Corvinus and military ruler of Hungary.

Edmund Husserl asserted that this work "gave transcendental phenomenology a new impulse" in a series of lectures which examines those aspects of this work that have "eternal significance". This work's preface states that it is in part motivated by the prospect of "persuad[ing] infidels", and its second section concludes that "bodies...are not properly perceived by the senses...but by the intellect alone;" that section sets out to show that "the nature of the human mind...is more easily known than the body". Its third section rejects the notion that the author could derive existence from causes other than a perfect God in order to demonstrate God's existence and concludes that God "cannot be a deceiver". Opening with a section which hypothesizes that an evil demon is tricking the author, for 10 points, identify this philosophical exposition that followed Discourse on Method, written by Rene Descartes.

Like Erik Erikson, this psychologist saw childhood as divided into periods separated by crises, though this psychologist used age rather than ideas as a basis. That idea, found in his The Problem of Age, succeeded another which described consciousness as based on reflex. In a more well-known theory, this psychologist described how children merely think out loud, while adults utilize an extremely complex mental speech in his discussion of what he termed internal language. This psychologist also developed a model which assists the development of childhood skill by giving tasks that are within the zone of proximal development. For 10 points, name this author of Thought and Language, a Russian psychologist.

answer: {histones}

A 2010 study showed that G9a, which methylates one of these proteins, is downregulated after cocaine use. In 1990 the Grunstein lab at UCLA caused yeast mating efficiency to decrease by replacing a lysine at position 16 of one of these proteins with either arginine, glycine, or glutamine. That study showed that mutations in SIR3 could partially allow mutated forms of these proteins to repress the transcription of HML-alpha and HMR-alpha. The lysines on the tails of these proteins are reversibly acetylated by proteins such as GCN5. An octamer consisting of two each of the 2A, 2B, 3, and 4 members of this family of proteins forms the protein core of a nucleosome. For 10 points, name this family of proteins around which DNA is packed in chromatin.

answer: {Goldberg} Variations

One of this work's movements is written in 6/8 time and features the heading "al tempo di Giga". The composer's biographer Johann Forkel argues that its penultimate movement is a joke based on the family tradition of singing vulgar peasant tunes at gatherings. The folk song "Cabbage and turnips have driven me away; had my mother cooked meat, I'd have decided to stay" was the basis for this work's penultimate section, which is a "quodlibet." This piece is the fourth member of the series Clavier-Ubung and every third section is a canon. This work was composed for the titular musician who played during the night to Count Kaiserling who suffered from insomnia. For 10 points, name this work by J. S.

answer: {Louis XIV}

One offensive ordered by this monarch was blunted by the Water Line erected decades earlier by Maurice of Nassau, but still prompted his enemies to lynch the De Witt brothers for instigating the "Disaster Year", or Rampjaar. One of this ruler's generals had a major rivalry with the Count of Montecuccoli, while another defeated Francisco Melo after a bold march through a mountain pass to break the siege of Rocroi. This ruler's territories were defended by a modification of the trace italienne that relied upon a pentagonal ravelin system, designed by his greatest military mind, Vauban. This monarch relied on the command of Turenne and the Prince of Conde to win clashes like the Battle of the Dunes, which led to the Treaty of the Pyrenees. Forced to accept the Treaty of Ryswick, for 10 points, name this impetus behind the War of Devolution and the War of the Grand Alliance, a long-reigning Frenchman known as the "Sun King".

One story about this character divides him into three versions, one of which is a trickster god given the epithet "dragonfly". In another version of this figure's myth, he is identified as Ti'iti'i, the son of Talaga. In yet another version of this figure's mythology, he was busy at a marae and unwilling to let the sun go down, so he simply stopped it by holding its rays. That story is also adapted into one in which he stops the sun with a lasso made out of his sister's pubic hair. In a more well-known story, he meets and marries his wife Hina after using a fishhook to pull up several coral islands from the bottom of the ocean. For 10 points, name this god who also fought the sun with a jawbone, a Polynesian god who also names a large Hawaiian island.

answer: {thermal equilibrium}

According to van Leeuwen's theorem, when this state occurs in a magnetic system, all eddies must dissipate. As a consequence of ergodicity, the phase density of a system in this state is given by an arbitrary function of the Hamiltonian. In quantum mechanical systems, the existence of this condition is equivalent to the requirement that the time-derivative of the density matrix vanish. In addition to CP violation and the existence of processes that violate baryon number, the non-existence of this state is necessary for baryogenesis, according to the Sakharov conditions. The transitivity of this state is expressed by the so-called zeroth law of thermodynamics. For 10 points, identify this steady state of a thermodynamic system in which the mean value of the system's temperature does not change with time.

One fictional resident of this city, "Cheese" Wagstaff, triggered an amusing sequence of events after publicly lamenting being forced to mercy-kill his dog. The New-Day Co-op was founded in this city, but saw its corporate ambitions stunted by the nail gun-driven activities of Snoop and Chris Partlow, who become locally suspected of raising zombies in rowhouses. Prior to adopting Wee-Bey's son Namond, Bunny Colvin segregated part of this city's populace into an area dubbed "Hamsterdam," much to the horror of comically inept Commissioner Burrell. The fabricated stories of journalist Scott Templeton complicate an equally fictional killing spree in this city's homeless community, a plot concocted to finance the investigation against Marlo Stanfield by Lester Freamon and Jimmy McNulty.
