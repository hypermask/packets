answer: {Leisler's} Rebellion [or {Leisler's Revolt}, etc.]

One effect of this event was the dismissal of Matthew Ploughman as customs collector. Fitz-John Winthrop led an assault on Canada undertaken as a result of this event. During this event, a council known as the General Assembly of the Province was appointed to raise taxes. This event began when a group of allegedly drunk men deposed Nicholas Bayard as commander of Fort James, and both Bayard and William Nichols were imprisoned. The leader of this rebellion was accused of treason after failing to hand over the fort in a timely fashion to Henry Sloughter, who had replaced Francis Nicholson as governor. For 10 points, name this uprising that occurred when news of the Glorious Revolution reached New York and lasted until the German immigrant in charge was executed in 1691.

answer: {Curie} temperature [or {Curie} point]

The spherical model of Berlin and Kac can be used to show that this quantity varies linearly with defect concentration. Landau-Ginzburg theory defines four critical exponents related to this quantity, two of which are the degree of the critical isotherm and the heat capacity. One way of deriving this quantity is through a theory in which the effective field is replaced by its mean equilibrium value; that method produces disagreements with experiment of up to a factor of two, and is known as the Weiss theory. When this quantity is approached from below, the magnetization goes continuously to zero, and rotation symmetry is broken at this point, which represents a second-order phase transition. Above this analogue of the Neel point, magnetic ordering is lost. For 10 points, identify this temperature above which a ferromagnet becomes paramagnetic.

The host of the International Festival of Animated Objects, this city located east of Banff National Park benefits during the winter from the warming effect of the Chinook winds. A recent issue in this city is the delay of highway construction due to concerns about the Tsuu T'ina. An oil boom peaking in the late 1980s led to the development of a downtown area that features the Plus 15 Skyway network and the Stephen Avenue pedestrian mall.

One group in this phylum probably descended from heteractinids, which went extinct during the Paleozoic Era. This phylum's immune response includes the accumulation of grey cells. In organisms in this phylum, totipotent amoebocytes allow for reproduction and the distribution of nutrients digested by current-producing choanocytes. Those choanocytes, with epidermal pinocytes, bound a gelatinous matrix known as the mesohyl, which separates the two layers of organisms in this phylum. The asconoid and syconoid body forms also feature an osculum along with spicules produced by sclerocytes. For 10 points, name this invertebrate phylum of sessile, suspension-feeding animals commonly known as sponges.

This work notes the importance of the ability for a citizen to foresee "how the authority will use its coercive powers in given circumstances". In another section, the author describes the "bad" jobs that must be accomplished efficiently but deter the humanitarians and attract the wicked. In yet another section, the author of this work rejects the idea of a directed economy by reasoning that pecuniary affairs are not "low" matters that restrict our freedom, but a key to greater freedom in all aspects of life. Those chapters are "Planning and the Rule of Law", "Why the Worst Get on Top" , and another section of this work is "The End of Truth". Using the examples of Nazis and Soviets, this work argues that socialism and central planning inevitably lead to oppression. For 10 points, name this libertarian work by Friedrich von Hayek.

The boundary between this region and the one above it can be home to trapped spheroidal modes known as Stoneley modes. The existence of PKJKP waves traversing this region has not been observed, but high-frequency PKiKP waves refracted through this region can be used to constrain the properties of its boundary. The boundary of this region sees a sharp increase in P-wave velocity over a distance of about 5 kilometers, and this region has a high Poisson ratio of about 0.45. The area between this region and the region directly above it is known as the "mushy zone", and the presence of this region was inferred from the presence of a "shadow" by Inge Lehman. This region of the earth has a radius of about 1215 kilometers, which is growing as the Earth cools and more material accretes in this region.

answer: {pH}

The log of free metal ion concentration in soil increases linearly with an increase in this property. Potential energy is plotted against this property in a diagram that shows regions of passivity and immunity, the Pourbaix diagram. An "optimum" of this property is the range over which an enzyme displays maximum catalytic activity. This property is equal to the negative log of the acid dissociation constant, minus the log of the quotient of the concentration of the weak acid and that of its conjugate base, by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. This property is plotted against the amount of titrant added in a titration chart. For 10 points, give this property that equals the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration in solution, which is seven for pure water.

Paul Draper has formulated a Bayesian version of this problem by relying on a postulate called the "indifference hypothesis". This problem titles a book by Peter van Inwagen, who has argued against it. William Rowe attempted to supply the inductive basis for this argument in an article about "Ruminations on" a certain property, and that article was subsequently criticized by Alvin Plantinga from the standpoint of "degenerate evidence". Hume formulated a version of this problem in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion by arguing that one could not show from a world with both good and bad in it that it has a perfectly good cause. Leibniz's attempt to resolve this problem led him to argue that this is the best of all possible worlds in his Theodicy.

The monomer for this compound was originally produced through the combination of vinyl acetylene with hydrogen chloride in the presence of cuprous chloride, though presently, a three-step process involving chlorination, isomerization, and dehydrochlorination results in the desired 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene product. Unlike the natural analog that it emulates, this compound is noninflammable and chemically inert, thus finding industrial uses in gaskets, electrical insulation, hoses, and pipes. It can be foamed with nitrogen gas to provide exposure protection, and its thermoplastic rubber properties can be enhanced through combination with Spandex. For 10 points, name this DuPont-discovered compound most commonly known for its use in laptop sleeves and wetsuits.
