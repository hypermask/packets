answer: {compactness}

Lindstrom's theorem states that first-order logic is the strongest logic having both this property and satisfying the Lowenheim-Skolem property. A method for finding a Hausdorff space with this property containing a given space is named for Stone and Cech. Equicontinuity is the main condition for determining whether a family of functions has this property by the Arzela-Ascoli theorem. Using the axiom of choice, it can be shown that an arbitrary product of spaces with this property has this property, a result known as Tychonoff's theorem. In Euclidean space, being closed and bounded is sufficient to show, according to the Heine-Borel theorem, that a set has this property. For 10 points, identify this property which holds of a set on which every open cover has a finite subcover.

answer: {acetylcholine}[{or ACh}]

MuSK acts with rapsyn to colocalize receptors for this molecule when it binds to the proteoglycan agrin found in the basal lamina. Binding of this molecule to those receptors causes a rotation of five transmembrane M2 helices. Alpha-bungarotoxin blocks the activity of this molecule, which is broken down by a namesake esterase rather than reuptaken in the synaptic cleft. The enzyme that catalyzes this molecule's synthesis is at abnormally low concentrations in Alzheimer's patients. Black widow venom stimulates excess release of this molecule, while botulinum toxin blocks its release; both result in paralysis. For 10 points, name this molecule found at the neuromuscular junction.

This constant appears in the denominator of the variable that multiples the square of the quantity one minus the ratio of solubility parameters to give the enthalpic component of the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter. This constant equals the molar mass times the difference in specific heat for a compound at constant pressure and that compound at constant volume. It also equals negative activation energy over temperature, times the natural log of the ratio of the equilibrium constant to the pre-exponential factor, by the Arrhenius equation. Boltzmann's constant equals this constant divided by Avogadro's number. For 10 points, name this constant that also equals the product of pressure and volume divided by the product of moles and temperature by the law after which it is named.

The second section of the third chapter of Robert Nozick's Philosophical Explanations is devoted to an analysis of this doctrine. Peter Unger wrote a book entitled Ignorance which purports to make a case for this philosophical doctrine, while an article by G.E. Moore that analyzes Russell's approach to this doctrine is titled after "Four Types of" it. Ancient exponents of this doctrine included Arcesilaus and Carneades, heads of the Academy who critiqued the "cataleptic impression" which formed the basis for Stoicist epistemology, as well as Pyrrho of Elis, who gives his name to another form of this doctrine. A book which asserts that "philosophy begins in medias res", was written by George Santayana to present a contrast between this doctrine and "animal faith".

This term is used to describe a set of potentials which are described by the Hertz vectors. The Goos-Hanchen effect observed in total internal reflection is a phase shift that affects propagations with one variety of this property. Different varieties of this property can be transformed into one another by a retarder plate. Mueller matrices operate on the vector representations of this property, which is described by the I, Q, U, and V, and the vector of this property rotates in proportion to the Verdet constant during propagation along a magnetic field in the Faraday effect.

The relationship between stress and strain in these entities is modeled by the Glen-Nye flow law. The equilibrium line altitude is the long term balance point along one of these, and a tower on one of these is known as a serac.A type of particles created by these entities, when blown by the wind, are known as loess. The Malaspina one of these is an example of the Piedmont variety of these objects. Sharp ridges formed by these are called arêtes, and material deposited directly from these structures is known as a till, while material removed from these objects by mass wasting can form a cirque. Two main types of these are contintental and alpine, and whale shaped hills formed by these are known as drumlins. Leaving behind debris accumulations calle moraines, for 10 points, name these large masses of ice.
