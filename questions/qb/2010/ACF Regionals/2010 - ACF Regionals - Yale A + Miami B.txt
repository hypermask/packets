This man's partisan, Gebhard of Salzburg, was successfully kept away from a meeting targeting this man by his long-time foe, Hugo Candidus. He was elevated to his highest office after a mixed crowd of clergy and laymen began angrily demanding his election during the funeral service of his predecessor, Alexander II. This man's most notable efforts were validated in the century after his death through the First Lateran Council and the Concordat of Worms thanks to the work of Callixtus II. The Synod of Worms condemned this man, whose response led to the appointment of Guibert of Ravenna as Antipope Clement III. Clerical marriage and simony were targeted by this Pope, whose most notable opponent made a long walk to Canossa and groveled in the snow after his excommunication. For 10 points, name this Pope who feuded with Henry IV during the Investiture Controversy, the seventh Pontiff to bear his name.

answer: {apoptosis}

The gene dcp-1 is necessary for this process to occur in Drosophila, and it can be triggered by the release of endonuclease G from the mitochondria. This process can be inhibited by a family of proteins with multiple BIRs at the amino terminus, or by a pathway involving Pl-3 kinase and Akt kinase, which phosphorylates the protein Bad. This process can be induced by hypoxia or heat shock, unless it is suppressed by Bcl-2. This process results from a release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, which triggers a cascade of caspases. Eventually resulting in the fragmentation of the cell, for 10 points, identify this process of programmed cell death.

Reacting these compounds with benzenesulfonyl chloride in an aqueous base can help distinguish between different varieties of them in a process known as the Hinsberg test. Primary ones can be formed in the presence of formic acid via the Leuckart reaction, and the related Eschweiler-Clarke procedure can methylate them. Reacting these compounds with hydrogen peroxide is the first step in converting them to alkenes via the Cope Elimination. They can be prepared by reacting an alkyl halide with potassium phthalimide in the Gabriel synthesis. For 10 points, identify this class of organic compounds containing a singly bonded nitrogen atom.

answer: {Symphonies} of Robert {Schumann} [prompt on "{works} of {Schumann}"]

The second of these works by this composer is unusual for having all four movements written in C. The fourth of these works exists in an earlier version that uses Italian tempo markings instead of German ones, and is notable for generating all the thematic material from one motif. The third of these works has a fourth movement that is notable for the introduction of three trombones supposedly portraying a ceremony the composer witnessed that elevated Archbishop von Geissel of Cologne to the rank of cardinal.

The first holder of this office was bailed out of a volatile political environment when the murder of US diplomat Robert Imbrie by an angry mob enabled him to institute an expansive crackdown on his critics. The second failed miserably by attempting the same strategy in the wake of the Cinema Rex fire in a city heavily developed by that predecessor, a veteran of the Cossack Brigade. At the advice of the minister Teymourtash, the first of them signed the Treaty of Saadabad and developed Abadan, while the second was forced to allow supply of the USSR through a certain "Corridor"during WWII. That man used the brutal SAVAK to crack down on dissidents and was brought to power after Kermit Roosevelt organized Operation AJAX to supplant Mohammed Mossadeq, only to fall himself to Kohmeini's Islamic Revolution.

This character's introductory speech in one of his appearances had the line "and I don't mean Mahatma Ghandi" changed to "And I ain't no mamby pamby". Until 1959, he was featured only in shorts directed by Friz Freleng, on whom he was based. In one appearance, he attempts to force his main enemy to fill in for the absent high-diver Fearless Freep, while in another he repeatedly answers his enemy's challenge to step over a line drawn in the sand, even when the line is drawn at the edge of a cliff. Other appearances involve portraying a jailer named Schulz, a Black Knight accompanied by a dragon with a sneezing problem, and, frequently, a pirate, in which guise he was accompanied by the Tasmanian Devil as the villain in Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island.

In the plane, this mathematician's namesake measure involves finding the greatest lower bound of the areas of the coverings of a given set, where a covering consists of a finite union of rectangles. One result named for this mathematician and Hölder follows from Zassenhaus's Lemma via Schreier's Refinement Theorem and states that any two composition series in a group are isomorphic. Any matrix with coefficients from an algebraically closed field can be rewritten in terms of blocks containing a single eigenvalue on the main diagonal and ones on the superdiagonal, a block form name after this man. Another result of his states that any closed curve divides the plane into an inside and an outside. For 10 points, identify this French mathematician, namesake of a "normal" or "canonical" form of a matrix, as well as a curve theorem.

After publishing an essay in the journal Logos critical of Willhelm Dilthey's view of history, this philosopher entered into a notable correspondence with Dilthey. Students of this thinker include the author of The Literary Work of Art, Roman Ingarden, as well as Eugen Fink, who was for a long time the possessor of this thinker's Bernau manuscripts. This philosopher's early works were attempts to base mathematics in psychology, while a later work addressed intersubjective experience with the concept of "lifeworld". In addition to Philosophy of Arithmetic and a series of speeches entitled The Crisis of European Sciences, his work Ideas defined the concept of noesis.

answer: {gluons}

In the Peccei-Quinn theory, which seeks a solution to the strong CP problem, the triangle anomaly involving these particles spontaneously breaks symmetry and gives mass to the axion. Evidence for the existence of these particles was deduced from three hadronic jet events with zero total angular momentum using electron-positron collisions in the PETRA experiment, which also determined this particle's spin. Deep inelastic scattering of photons off protons reveal that these neutral particles carry away about half of the proton momentum. Like quarks, these particles are unobservable in the singlet state due to asymptotic freedom. These spin-1 particles are massless and mediate a force described by the SU(3) symmetry group, which results in their carrying a color charge. For 10 points, identify these gauge bosons of QCD, which mediate the strong force.

This man got his first major break when being appointed to the post of Junior Lord of the Admiralty during the ministry of the Duke of Portland. Soon afterwards, he was appointed to Chancellor of the Exchequer, which was at that time a less important office than what it would later become. This man's long stint as Foreign Secretary came to an end with the demise of Melbourne's administration, when he was replaced by Lord Aberdeen, who was considerably less interventionist than this man. This man famously made his Civis Romanus sum speech in defense of his stance on the Don Pacifico Affair. This man was both preceeded and succeded by John Russell in his most famous post, during which the Second Opium War occurred as well as the American Civil War. For 10 points, name this last British Prime Minister to die in office, known for his aggressive liberal interventionist stance on foreign policy, and who sometimes lends his name to his namesake "age".
