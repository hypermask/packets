answer: The {Fronde}

Abel Servien was charged with disrupting the finances of many of the major players in this conflict. Spanish intervention in this conflict was led by the archduke Leopold Wilhelm and successfully resisted at Guise by the Duke of Choiseul. That commander's greatest victory came at the Battle of Blanc-Champ in spite of a dispute between the Picardie regiment and the Gardes francaises that gave Turenne an opening. That battle, also known as Rethel, was decisive in the second, or Prince's phase of this conflict; the peace of Rueil finished the Parlement's phase after the Peace of Westphalia freed the Prince de Conde's army to rush to the aid of Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin. For 10 points, name this French civil war beginning in 1648 which plagued the early reign of Louis XIV and takes its name from a child's sling.

answer: the vorticity [prompt on {rot}, {omega}, or {circulation}]

The square of this quantity is known as the enstrophy and is used as a diagnostic variable in many atmospheric codes. This quantity appears as the analogue of current in the fluid analogue of the Biot-Savart law. In order for Bernoulli's equation to apply, a fluid must have a value of zero for this quantity. For a force-free fluid, the Reynolds transport equation for this quantity has as inhomogeneous term given by the cross product of the pressure gradient with itself over the density squared plus the curl of the divergence of the viscous stress tensor over the density; that equation represents conservation of angular momentum in a fluid. For 10 points, name this fluid quantity that is equal to the curl of the velocity field and that represents the local circulation rate.

answer: {Analects} [or {Lunyu}]

The main figure notes that he is a transmitter and not a maker, and we are told that he never sang on the same day as he wept. He also claims that a man who can bear to support eight rows of mimes can bear to do anything, and admonishes a detractor of animal sacrifice to love the ceremony, not the sheep. In book 11 he reminds us that "to go beyond is as wrong as to fall short", but his followers chide him for excessive mourning over the death of one of their number. Book 2, in which the speaker claims to have learned the decrees of heaven by age fifty thanks to bending his mind to study at age fifteen, is concerned with government, and the final book begins with an admonishment to "hold fast the due Mean" from the mythical emperor Yao. For 10 points, name this collection of sayings dating from the Spring and Autumn period, the foremost work of Confucianism.

answer: {Gibbs}-{Duhem} equation [prompt on {Gibbs}' {phase rule}]

One corollary to this equation gives the ratio of activity to mole fraction for the constituents of a binary system as the ratio of derivatives of activities with respect to mole fractions at constant pressure and temperature. It can be derived by substituting the temperature and pressure Maxwell relations into the usual differential of the Gibbs function, then equating the differential of the definition of the Gibbs function as a sum over species only. It sets differential pressure time volume equal to entropy times differential temperature plus sum over species of particle number times differential chemical potential. For 10 points, name this equation used in the usual derivation of the rule that the number of species plus the number of degrees of freedom minus the number of phases equals two.

A recent television appearance saw the artist behind this song praise its simplicity while introducing David Beckham to the Chicken and Waffles breakfast experience, while this song's video leads Beavis to claim that he used to go to the Compton Swap Meet with the singer. That video features an extended intro where the purported father of one of the singers tells the singer "don't be messin' with the 8 track". The singer complains that "Every body got their cups, but they ain't chipped in", while the role of the singer's younger brother in this track's video is played by Lil Bow Wow, who had been discovered by the singer a year earlier. Its chorus sees the singer claim that he is "Laid back with my mind on my money, and my money on my mind", perhaps because of his resounding affinity for Tanqueray. For 10 points, name this 1994 track off Doggystyle, a hit for Snoop Dogg.

An important one-word excision in this speech was made on the advice of James Killian, and Ralph Williams later lamented that a section about the "tendency for orderly societies to break down into mob ridden anarchies" was excised. This speech, written in collaboration with Malcolm Moos, warned that irresponsible spending might make democracy "the insolvent phantom of tomorrow", and that "a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity". Noting that in past years "American makers of plowshares could....make swords as well", it also warned against undue influence of the "military-industrial complex".

answer: {splicing}

The usual form of this procedure takes the form of two transesterifications: the first transesterification has a branch-point two-prime hydroxyl making a nucleophilic back-attack to form a so-called lariat intermediate that is then liberated by a the second transesterification. That so-called canonical pathway for this process makes use of the accessory enzymes SF1 and 2 and BBP, which work in complement with the major catalyst, a protein-RNA complex comprised of five snRNPs and named for this process. Sections to undergo this process are marked by a three-prime AG and five-prime GU. For 10 points, name this genetic process whereby a transcript RNA is prepared for translation by the removal of introns.

answer: {Dirac delta} function [prompt on {delta function}]

Substituting this mathematical object in for the inhomogeneous term in an integrodifferential equation yields the equation satisfied by the associated Green's function. This object is the fundamental example of the class of abstract sequentially continuous linear functionals on non-metric vector spaces of C-infinity-zero functions; such objects are known as singular distributions. Operation of convolution with a sequence approximating this functional converges in distribution to the identity operation. Therefore, the convolution of this object with any function f yield f of zero, a fact known as the sifting property. This distribution can be considered the generalized derivative of the step function. For 10 points, name this mathematical object that can be understood as a spike of unit area, zero width, and infinite height.
