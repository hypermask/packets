answer: {Almoravid} dynasty

An important victorious battle for this polity is sometimes given a name that translates as "slippery ground" due to the excessive bloodshed. After this polity's fall, a small offshoot dynasty known as the Banu Ghaniya persisted for many decades. Its origins can be traced to the tribal leader Yahya ibn Ibrahim, and it lost at the battle of Ourique during the reign of Ali ibn Yusuf. Earlier, at the earlier battle of Sagrajas, its most successful leader, Yusuf ibn Tashfin, won a decisive victory over forces under Alfonso VI. This dynasty essentially ended after its capital of Marrakesh was conquered by its successor dynasty in 1147. For 10 points, name this Muslim Berber dynasty of north-west Africa and Spain that was succeeded by the Almohads.

answer: {Adam's Rib}

At a dinner party in this movie, a married couple watch a home movie of how they paid off their mortgage on their farm, during which a neighbor makes jokes at the husband's expense, calling wife-kissing an "old Connecticut custom". That neighbor composes the song Farewell, Amanda, and later the husband slaps his wife, whom he calls "Pinkie". Late in the film, the husband catches his wife with Kip, and puts a gun in his mouth, pretending to be committing suicide, but then bites off the gun, revealing it to be black licorice. In the opening scene, Doris shoots her husband Walter after catching him with another woman, and Amander Bonner decides to defend Doris on the principle of equality for women. For 10 points, name this 1949 comedy starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn as married lawyers on opposite sides of an attempted-murder trial.

answer: {torus} [accept word forms like {toroidal} before "{objects}"]

This term refers to a knot which is defined in cylindrical polar coordinates by the equations "r equals 2 plus cosine of p theta over q", and "z equals sin of p theta over q", where p and q are relatively prime integers. The fundamental group of one of these objects is equal to the cartesian product of the integers with themselves. The Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem concerns quasiperiodic orbits described by trajectories moving on the surface of one of these objects, which can be viewed as the cartesian product of two circles. By the Heawood conjecture, 7 colors are needed to color this genus one surface, which can be obtained by gluing opposite edges of a rectangle together with no twists. For 10 points, identify this kind of three-dimensional surface with a single hole, whose name describes the shape of a donut.

answer: John {Searle}

This thinker's approach to consciousness and the mind-body problem is known as "biological naturalism", while an early paper of his which drew much criticism was "How to Derive 'Ought' from Is". Borrowing a concept from Elizabeth Anscombe, he distinguished between "institutional" facts and "brute" facts in The Construction of Social Reality. He referred to humans' common assumptions and practices as the "Background" which is required for intentional states in his 1983 work Intentionality. This philosopher also developed a thought experiment to refute strong-AI, in which a person receives written words, feeds them to a computer, and sends back the computer's output. For 10 points, name this philosopher who wrote 1969's Speech Acts, and who created the "Chinese Room" argument.

Valentine Greene's 1779 mezzotint of this work helped increase both this work and its artists' popularity. The painter originally drafted this work with a youth in center instead of a balding man, and Morro Castle can be seen in the top right corner. One of the titular figures' right foot cannot be seen due to the composition, suggesting that it is missing, and his right hand is reaching for a length of rope hanging from the side of a boat. In the center, two men in white reach for that figure, while a man on the right holds a harpoon and is attacking the title animal in this work's lower right corner.

answer: optical {fiber} or glass {fiber} or {fiber optics}

Attenuation in these objects can be measured using either the cut-back method or a technique known as OTDR, in which sudden spectral peaks indicate a splice loss. The performance of these devices is theoretically limited by the Rayleigh scattering limit, which is why exotic materials like fluoride are being developed for their manufacture. Depending on whether a discontinuity in the index of refraction is present between the core and the cladding, these devices are classified as step-index or gradient-index types. Like waveguides in general, variants of these devices which allow for more than one bound solution for each polarization are known as the multimode type. For 10 points, identify these optical waveguides which allow light to propagate through a core, frequently made of glass, by means of total internal reflection.

answer: {Golden Bull} [accept {chrysobull} after the {Byzantine} name; accept {Papal Bull} until {Byzantine empire} is mentioned]

The Gniezno incarnation resulted from Boleslaw III's acceptance of the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire, and led to the de-facto independence of the Polish church. A 1242 instance of this saw Hungarian king Bela IV grant city rights to present-day Zagreb, though the most famous example of one of these confirmed the role of the city of Frankfurt and explicitly specified the role of the archbishop of Mainz. Emperor Frederic II was identified as the source of the 1218 one of Berne, considered a forgery, but definitely did issue one dealing with the holdings of Teutonic knights in Prussia named for the town of Rimini. The best-known of these documents was issued in 1356 by Charles IV and codified the Diet of Nuremberg's rulings regarding Holy Roman Emperor election.

answer: St. {Valentine's} Day {Massacre}

This event was brought to the attention of Jeanette Landesman when she heard a barking German shepherd named Highball. A key error in the execution of this event was a misidentification by the Keywell brothers. Among those killed during this event were an optician named Reinhardt Schwimmer and Albert Weinshank. The victims of this event had been tricked into believing that they were waiting for a delivery of stolen whiskey. This event, which took place at North Clark Street in the SMC Cartage Co. building, failed to kill its primary target, George "Bugs" Moran, who suspected a raid and kept walking after a police car pulled up too early.

This element can be detected in a test that uses strips of paper sensitized with mercuric chloride placed in a bottle containing granulated zinc, water, and hydrochloric acid. Another test for this element precipitates metallic silver out of a silver nitrate solution after a compound containing this element is reacted with nascent hydrogen. Those tests, named respectively for Gutzeit and Marsh, are used to distinguish this element from antimony. Paul Erlich developed syphilis-treating drugs containing this element, such as atoxyl and Salvarsan.

After two failed attempts, this man was able to win the presidency on the strength of his 110 propositions program. He became mired in controversy over his secret order to sink the Green Peace ship Rainbow Warrior, and earned early enmity by opposing de Gaulle in the 1958 Algiers Crisis.

One modification of a reaction used to synthesize this functionality uses dimethyl 1-diazo-2-oxopropylphosphonate, also known as the Ohira-Bestmann reagent, and an aldehyde. The original reaction uses a ketone and is a low temperature, base-promoted homologation named for Seyferth and Gilbert. Two molecules containing this functionality can be coupled end-to-end in another reaction named for Eglinton. That reaction relies on the terminal variety of this functionality, which can be synthesized by reacting an aldehyde with triphenylphosphine and a geminal dihalide on an alkenyl carbon.
