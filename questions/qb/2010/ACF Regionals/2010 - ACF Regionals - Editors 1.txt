answer: {Chronicle} of a {Death Foretold} [accept {Crónica} de {una muerte anunciada}]

In this novel, Xius dies of shock after refusing an offer of two bags of money to buy his house, because it reminds him of his dead wife Yolanda.

Father Amador performs a haphazard autopsy when Dr. Dionisio Iguaran is gone, and later Colonel Lazaro Aponte checks on the time of his domino game rather than investigating two men in Clotilde Armenta's milk shop, who are waiting for the son of Placida Linero. The title event of this novel is precipitated by Bayardo San Roman returning his wife Angela to her family on their wedding night.

answer: The {Funeral Oration} of {Pericles} [accept anything about {Pericles talking} about {Dead people}]

It notes that the real disgrace of poverty is not merely in its fact, but in "declining the struggle against it", and defends the pursuit of knowledge "without effeminacy." A caustic passage proclaims that the audience goes perpetually without assistance while another group drags a host of subjugated allies before them, and further criticizes that group for their preoccupation with false obsessions with manhood. More famously, it declares that "only love of honor" never grows old, and describes an administration favoring the many rather than the few, noting "this is why it is called democracy." Offering "comfort, not condolence" for men who "chose to die resisting rather than live submitting", for 10 points, identify this most famous passage from Thucydides, a eulogy delivered for fallen soldiers by the ruler of the Athenian Golden Age.

In ancient art, this figure is often accompanied by spirits called the Karpoi. This figure causes the death of Amphairos by opening up a chasm into which he falls. One myth about this figure depicts Athena taking care of one of her children. That child resulted from a piece of wool covered in Hephaestus' semen and was named Erechthonius.  In one myth, sprinkles of blood upon this figure caused the births of the Erinnyes, the Gigantes, and the Melian nymphs. One of this goddess' children used a scythe to force her husband away from crushing her. That child was Cronus, who attacked this goddess' husband Ouranos, and the result allowed living creatures to spring to life upon this goddess.

In platelets, much of this protein is found attached to a peptide named Fx, which was found to be identical to thymosin beta-4. Branching of this protein is stimulated by WASp proteins; the branch points are occupied by a protein typically isolated due to its ability to bind profilin. CapZ is responsible for calcium-independent capping of the plus end of one form of this protein. A toxin from the so-called "angel of death" mushroom, phalloidin, works by preventing this protein's filamentous F form from being depolymerized into G monomers. Microfilaments are made up of this protein, which is absent in the H zone of a sarcomere. For 10 points, name this protein that slides alongside myosin to produce muscle contractions.

In one hilariously racist appearance, this character laments "he thinks he's speared a lion...he wants me to praise him" when his radio is impaled by an African named Thursday, whom he discovered in a crate of imported bananas. After riding a rhea to the Cantina Argentina, this character once drunkenly leered at a showgirl whom he had mouth-raped in an earlier appearance after failing to coerce her into making out with him by performing dangerous maneuvers; that love interest is saved by expandable granny panties when she risks suicide to escape this character's assaults, leaping out of a shoddily-constructed biplane this figure builds as a tribute to Lindbergh. More famously, this protagonist of The Gallopin' Gaucho and Plane Crazy drowns a parrot who ridicules him after abusing a series of animals to perform "Turkey in the Straw," earning the ire of Captain Pete. For 10 points, name this star of Steamboat Willie who, when not beating Jonas Brothers or abusing his girlfriend Minnie, serves as the rodent mascot for the Walt Disney Company.

This man's forced publishing of an itemized list of "self-criticisms" influenced his support for works of "Scar Literature", and he established the use of Special Administrative Regions to reconcile the Basic Law governing key regions with his own central leadership, advocating the "one country, two systems" doctrine. He famously derided the need to use a cat of any particular color to catch mice and advocated enlarging rather than removing the bird cage in zoological metaphors defending his economic flexibility, rejecting the extreme rigidity of his major rival, Hua Guofeng.

answer: {internal} energy [prompt on partial answer]

In a Fermi gas, this quantity is proportional to h-bar over 2 m times the number of particles raised to the five-thirds power, over the volume raised to the two-thirds power. For a system that obeys the van der Waals equation of state, this quantity contains an additive factor of the particle number squared times the a constant over volume. For an arbitrary system, this quantity is given by the derivative with respect to the thermodynamic beta of the partition function, and the Helmholtz free energy is obtained by subtracting temperature times entropy from the average value of this quantity. For a closed system the change in this quantity is given by the work done by the system plus the heat, and for an ideal gas it is given by the three-halves times the number of particles times Boltzmann's constant times temperature. For 10 points, identify this quantity which represents the total amount of kinetic and potential energy in a gas.

One of the major practices associated with these events occurred in between rows of seven stone columns in the courtyard of the Hall of Heroes, and saw an item named for the bodily fluid of Andreas Bauriedl used to anoint fresh banners for the coming year; that "Blood Flag" was normally kept in the Brown House. Accounts of these events were published in "Red" and “Blue Books,” and they were organized primarily by the local machine of Julius Streicher. A supposedly too controversial speech about Ethiopia was replaced at the last minute by the most famous announcement at one of these events, which concerned the hiring of young women and dealth with the status of Mischlings.

In number theory, this term is used to designate integers with n minus one digits which, when multiplied by an integer less than n, result in the same digits in a different order. In physics, this term designates a generalized coordinate whose conjugate generalized momentum is conserved, and thus one on which the Lagrangian does not depend. In group theory, this adjective is used to describe groups which are generated by a single element, while in graph theory this term designates a graph which contains at least one path whose first and last nodes are the same.

answer: electronegativity

An equation stating that the square of one measure of this quantity is equal to square of the band gap minus the square of the homopolar band gap was developed by Phillips and van Vechten. The principle of equalization of this quantity states that in a bond, each atom's value for this quantity will be the geometric mean of the atoms' original values; that principle was developed by Sanderson, who computed this quantity as the ratio of atomic number to atomic volume, divided by what would be expected from a linear interpolation of those values for inert gases. The first ionization energy and electron affinity are averaged to obtain the Mulliken scale for it, and the Pauling scale assigns fluorine a value of four. For 10 points, name this measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons to itself.

Nelson Goodman ridiculed the suggestion that what he called the "Tingle-Immersion," theory was the right way to approach these objects.
