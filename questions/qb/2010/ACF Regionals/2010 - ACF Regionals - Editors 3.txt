answer: {Leon Walras}

Four sets of equations, including two that describe the function of individual households, comprise the model named for this man and Cassel. This man theorized that in perfect competition, profits would approximate zero, because prices would approximate costs. Each agent calculates his demand for the good at every possible price and submits this to an auctioneer in the auction named for this man. The law named for this man suggests that if all other markets in a system are in equilibrium, the remaining market must also be in equilibrium; that observation underpins his most famous theory, which was improved upon by Arrow and Debreu. For 10 points, name this French author of Elements of Pure Economics, the founder of General Equilibrium Theory.

answer: {Lewis acids} [or {Lewis bases} until "{aldols}"; prompt on {Lewis}; prompt on {acids}]

The change in enthalpy for a certain type of reaction involving these compounds is dependent on their reactance by the Drago equation. Mukaiyama found that these compounds can promote the formation of aldols from acetals and silyl enol ethers. These compounds are used to promote high selectivity of oxidation of ketones to lactones or esters in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. They are necessary to remove the chlorine atom from an alkyl or acyl halide in the first step of the Friedel-Crafts reactions. For 10 points, name these compounds that include tin tetrachloride and boron trifluoride, which act as electron pair acceptors in their namesake American chemist's acid-base theory.

He suggested that the possibility of turning the world into "the opposite of hell" would signify the titular event in a speech entitled The End of Utopia, while his critique of Marxist aesthetics is contained in The Aesthetic Dimension. This philosopher offered a "critique of Neo-Freudian revisionism" in a work which traced the "origin of the repressed individual", which it blamed on capitalism. This thinker's most famous work ends with the call for a "Great Refusal", and analyzes how such tools as "the language of total administration" result in the formation of the titular kind of person.

answer: {density}

In polytropic equations, the pressure is given as proportional to this quantity raised to some power, while the virial expansion writes the pressure over the temperature in terms of powers of this quantity. In cosmology, the quantity "3 times the square of the Hubble constant over quantity 8 pi times the gravitational constant," is known as the "critical" type of this quantity. The time-derivative of this quantity balances the divergence of its flux in fluid continuity equations. This quantity appears multiplied by both the square of the velocity and the gravitational acceleration times the height as a counterbalance to the pressure in Bernoulli's equation. Multiplying the volume and gravitational acceleration in the expression for buoyant force, for 10 points, identify this term which denotes how much of something there is per unit volume.

answer: {Seleucid Empire}

This kingdom capitulated to client-state status, surrendering an annual roster of hostages per the Treaty of Apamea, in the wake of a crushing loss to the Attalid Euemenes II and Lucius Scipio.

One of its greatest kings lost the Battle of Magnesia after earlier winning at Raphia over a ruler of this dynasty's major rival; that rival king bore the epithet "Philopator".

answer: {collagen}

Autoantibodies attack the alpha-3 chains of one type of this protein in Goodpasture's Syndrome. Substitution of serine for cysteine at position 1564 of the alpha-5 chain of that type of this protein leads to a severe form of Alport Syndrome. Along with laminins, type IV of this protein forms a two-dimensional mesh in the basal lamina. This protein primarily consists of a triple helix of Gly-X-Y repeats, where X and Y are typically proline and hydroxyproline. Type I of this protein is secreted by chondrocytes and osteoblasts, and is mineralized to form bone matrix. For 10 points, name this most abundant protein in the human body, whose high tensile strength makes it ideal in tendons and skin.

answer: Antonio de Oliveira {Salazar}

This man survived an assassination attempt by the leader of the General Confederation of Labour, a trade union whose downfall had vaulted him to power, and used future Piazza Fontana bomber Yves Guerin-Serac to run the Aginter Press. His brutal order to massacre civilians and then commit suicide frightened a subordinate into surrendering in the face of Operation Vijay, while he crushed an early uprising led by the "blueshirts"or National Syndicalists. The friendship between this organizer of the shadowy PIDE and Ian Smith kept Rhodesia afloat for years, though it led to his government losing ground to movements like FRELIMO and UNITA, whose efforts towards independence led to the ouster of this man's successor, Marcelo Caetano, in the Carnation Revolution. For 10 points, identify this former political economist who like Getulio Vargas presided over an Estado Novo, the Prime Minister of Portugal from 1932 to 1968.

Vilhelm Bjerknes formulated an early theory of these systems, which became known as the Norwegian polar front model. These systems may form through interactions with local orography through a process called "lee troughing," in which a column of air descends down the lee side of a mountain. Low-level flow in baroclinic waves is dominated by the extra-tropical variety of these systems. The better-known tropical variety of these systems draw their energy from the release of the latent heat of water vapor condensation and feature a center with low humidity and low wind speeds, and all of these systems exhibit Coriolis circulation. Capable of developing into hurricanes, for 10 points, identify these closed wind systems that circulate in the direction of the Earth's rotation and often feature a namesake "eye" at their center.

An early resistance movement in this country was organized by a local queen named Anacaona. One of its rulers lost power after foolishly entrusting sole leadership of his presidential guard to General Geffrard, who himself was ousted five years later in the wake of the Bizoton Affair. Another came to power despite earlier partnering with Rigaud and Boyer in the failed "War of the Knives". That man's rival shot himself with a silver bullet in the courtyard of his palace, whose name ironically translates to "without worry," after losing control of the southern half of this nation to a coalition of wealthy affranchis. Alexandre Petion and Henri I jockeyed for control of this country, also ruled by Faustin I, following a revolution against forces led by Sonthonax and Charles Leclerc that briefly left Jean-Jacques Dessalines in power.
