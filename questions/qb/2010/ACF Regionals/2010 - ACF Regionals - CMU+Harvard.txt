answer: {shortest path} algorithms [accept with any of the {following modifying} the answer: {all}-{pairs}, {single}-{source}, or {single}-{source single}-{destination}]

Zhan and Noon tested algorithms for solving this problem, finding approximate or double bucket modifications to one algorithm and Pallattino's algorithm with two queues were fastest on actual data. Johnson's algorithm solves this problem in the sparse case faster than the cubic Floyd's algorithm, both of which solve this for all pairs. Another approach uses dynamic programming, and checks all edges n times; that algorithm also detects negative cost cycles, and is named for Bellman and Ford. A Fibonacci heap is used to speed up a greedy approach, which works only for positive-weight edges, while if an admissible heuristic is available, the A* algorithm can be used. For 10 points, identify this problem in graph theory, most famously solved by Dijkstra's algorithm, which asks for a fast route between two nodes.

Edward Simon showed that the results of this experiment held in HeLa cells. When reviewing the manuscript that ultimately published this experiment's results, John Cairns suggested a reason why its results with salmon sperm were different. Along with Vinograd, the experimenters had the year before perfected a way of using cesium chloride to establish a density gradient during centrifugation. This pulse-chase experiment disproved Max Delbrück's ideas about the “unwinding problem.” It grew E. coli in nitrogen-15 labeled media for several generations, then moved it to a nitrogen-14 medium and looked at the density of DNA in further generations. For 10 points, what doubly-eponymous experiment confirmed the semiconservative nature of DNA replication?

answer: {measurement} or {observation} [accept {experiment} before *]

According to Neumark's theorem, one of these realizable actions can always be constructed for a given positive value operator. The resolution of the consistency problem associated with this action(*) requires that it be irreversible. Repeating this process very frequently results in a "freezing" of the system state, a phenomenon known as the quantum Zeno effect. Mathematically, this process can be thought of as the forced projection of the system state onto an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, and according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, this process cannot be performed simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy for non-commuting observables. For 10 points, identify this action which in von Neumann's formalism of quantum mechanics results in the collapse of the wave function to an energy eigenstate.

This work argues that common representations share “pictorial form” and that a fact is a “state of affairs,” as part of its claim that thoughts and propositions are pictures.  The sixth section of this work presents the “general form of proposition” and argues that propositions of logic are tautologies, and thus meaningless.  The structure of this work is built around seven aphorisms, the first of which is “the world is all that is the case” and the final that “what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.” Later repudiated in its author's Philosophical Investigations, for 10 points, name this first and major work of Ludwig Wittgenstein.
