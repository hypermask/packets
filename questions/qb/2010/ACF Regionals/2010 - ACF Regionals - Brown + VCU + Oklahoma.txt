Sodium-mediated antiport membrane proteins in these structures can be passively inhibited through the use of digitalis extracts which block sodium-potassium ATPases. They are mechanically coupled to plasma membrane dihydropyridine receptors. Though not found in neurons, they possess ryanodine receptors which can be activated when phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 into DAG and the signaling molecule inositol trisphosphate. Depending on the cell type, extensions of these structures form dyads or triads with adjacent T-tubules and they contain the protein calsequestrin. For 10 points, name these structures found within muscle cells which store intercellular calcium and are a modified form of an organelle that is continuous with the nuclear envelope and comes in a rough form.

answer: {Trout} Quintet

The exposition of this work's "Allegro Vivace" first movement opens with an A major arpeggio up two octaves in triplets, while the recapitulation repeats the exposition transposed down a perfect fifth. Sylvester Paumgarter commissioned this work so the cello did not play the bass line and its unusual instrumentation was borrowed from a piece by Johann Nepomuk Hummel. A recurring motif of a rising sextuplet represents jumping through a stream. This work is written for piano, violin, viola, cello, and double bass substituting the bass for the second violin. It takes its title from variations in the fourth movement on the composer's earlier lieder "Die Forelle". For 10 points, name this piano quintet by Schubert named after a fish.

Two of these objects are said to be Morita-equivalent if there is an equivalence between their module categories. Every local example of one of these objects has a finite Krull dimension and modules are defined over these objects. Examples of these objects satisfying the descending chain condition are known as Artinian ones. The ascending chain condition, the requirement that all ideals be finitely generated and that every ideal contain a maximal element are criteria that are satisfied by Noetherian ones of these. . Commutative examples of these objects have no zero divisors and are called integral domains, of which fields are a subset. For 10 points, identify these algebraic structures exemplified by the integers which unlike groups consist of a set and two binary operations, usually addition and multiplication.

The remnants of a force crushed by this man's general, the Duke of Gaeta, formed the Papal Zouave corps in the wake of the Battle of Castelfidardo, which allowed the passage of the Law of Guarantees. France pledged support to this figure in the Treaty of Plombieres and allied with him in a series of battles that prompted the Treaty of Zurich.

answer: {spin} [prompt on {angular momentum}]

The Sivers mechanism is used to model one type of asymmetry of this property, and this property gives its name to a type of disordered material modeled by the Sherrington-Kirpatrick model. The relaxation and transport of it is the basis for Giant Magnetoresistance sandwich structures used in hard disks, and the three canonical operators for this quantity are obtained by multiplying h-bar over 2 times the Pauli matrices. Heisenberg proposed these kinds of chains as a model for magnetism, and the experiment that led to its discovery as a quantum phenomenon used a furnace to fire silver atoms through an inhomogeneous magnetic field with the results consistent with only two possible values of this property. For 10 points, identify this quantity investigated by the Stern-Gerlach experiment which has integer values for bosons and half-integer values for fermions.

Yohai Benkler tacked the word “Linux,” onto the title of one of this man's most famous essays in an essay partially named after this man's “penguin.” This thinker showed that the title objects were privately provided and charged for their service, challenging their use as an example of public goods, in "The Lighthouse in Economics". This man traced to the Department of the Navy the allocation of the spectrum by the FCC in the course of arguing that the FCC should instead auction off spectrum bands. In another paper, this man stated that the title entities are like national economies, except that they are formed based on decisions concerning marketing costs. Another of his essays uses the example of a cattle rancher's cows destroying a farmer's crops in arguing against the ideas of Arthur Pigou to state that, if rights can be transferred with low transaction costs, then property rights need not be precisely defined, because parties can trade them.

For an ideal gas, this quantity is equal to the number of moles times Boltzmann's constant, times the sum of five halves and the natural log of the quantity one over moles times volume divided by the cube of the thermal wavelength. For molecules in a solid, this quantity can be expressed as one over temperature times the difference between internal energy and zero point energy, plus the natural log of the rotational partition function times the product of moles and Boltzmann's constant. This quantity is also equal to the enthalpy minus Gibbs free energy, all over temperature. It is always increasing by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. For 10 points, give this thermodynamic quantity symbolized S, which measures the amount of disorder in a system.
