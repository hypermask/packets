answer: lysosomes

When TFEB translocates to the nucleus, it results in a corresponding increase in the number of these organelles. A glycosphingolipid in this organelle, iGb3, is necessary for the production of natural killer cells. P-type lectins direct enzymes that have been tagged with mannose-6-phosphate to this organelle. Christian Rene de Duve discovered this organelle after centrifuging liver cells and discovering an abnormally high amount of acid phosphatase. Malfunction of this organelle can lead to a buildup of gangliosides in Tay-Sachs disease.

answer: {Bardeen}-{Cooper}-{Schrieffer} theory

The effective potential in this theory includes a term known as the "vector correction", which is logarithmic in in the ratio of the frequency to the Debye frequency. This theory uses three Green's correlation functions whose poles give the excitation energy, and much of the experimental corroboration for this theory came from electron tunneling experiments conducted by Ivar Giaever. In this theory, an attractive potential exists within a Debye energy of the Fermi surface and this theory's successes include the explanation of the isotope effect and the prediction of the energy gap in the excitation spectrum after transition. For 10 points, identify this theory in which the interaction of phonons with electron pairs results in superconductivity, named for its three formulators.

That experiment coined the term "cyranoid". In another of his experiments, he had groups watch an episode of Medical Center with different endings to see if a more violent ending would cause violent behavior. He sent packages to people in Omaha, Nebraska, seeing if they could eventually pass the packages on to Boston. This "small world" experiment reportedly showed there were "six degrees of separation".

answer: {Boyle}-{Mariotte} Law

Laplace replaced this law with the adiabatic law to give a correct derivation of the speed of sound. This law was discovered during its namesake's attempts to disprove Franciscus Linus's funicular hypothesis. This law was later derived by taking the limit as the ratio of molecular diameter to average intermolecular distance goes to zero. One experiment verifying this law involves taking a J-shaped piece of glass tubing, sealing air at one end, and placing varying amounts of mercury into the tube. The air pump designed to verify this law was designed by Robert Hooke, an assistant to its namesake. For 10 points, name this gas law which states that for an ideal gas at a fixed temperature, pressure and volume are inversely proportional, a law named after an Irish chemist.
