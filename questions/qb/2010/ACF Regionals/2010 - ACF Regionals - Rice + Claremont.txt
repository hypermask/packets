answer: {gravity waves} [accept word forms as {well} as {gravitational radiation}]

These phenomena are believed to be responsible for the predicted polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. One possible path to detection of these phenomena is the observation of growing perturbations of spinning neutron stars, an effect known as the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability. The amplitude of these tensor phenomena is given by the second time derivative of the quadrupole source term in the post-Newtonian method of analyzing them. Evidence for these phenomena includes the orbital shrinking of binary systems such as the Hulse-Taylor pulsar, and these objects are being sought by both the Large Interferometric Space Antenna and the LIGO project. For 10 points, identify these tensor perturbations predicted by general relativity which represent emissions of energy from massive systems.

answer: {consciousness}

One thinker formulated the Multiple Drafts Model to explain this phenomenon, while another philosopher, Joseph Levine, has proposed that our understanding of this phenomenon is limited by the "explanatory gap". Colin McGinn used the concept of cognitive closure to argue that this phenomenon will never be properly understood. Thomas Nagel opens his essay, "What is it like to be a bat?" with the assertion that this phenomenon "is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable", while Daniel Dennett argued against the existence of a "Cartesian Theater", in a 1991 book about this phenomenon "explained". David Chalmers notably called explaining its subjective character the "hard problem" of this phenomenon. Philosophical zombies are held to lack, for 10 points, what attribute of minds, which equates to awareness?

answer: Symphony {No. 5} in D-major [accept A {Soviet Artist's Response} to {Justified Criticism} before it is read]

This symphony's "Largo" third movement features no brass and surprisingly calls for the violins to be divided into three sections. The composer was inspired by the opening of Mahler's Fourth Symphony for the first four measures of this work, which sets up a sharply dotted rhythm of repeated As playing against a melody on the first violins. The finale movement quotes from the composer's setting of the Pushkin poem "Rebirth" and is dubbed a "forced rejoicing" in the autobiography Testimony. This symphony was after the scandal surrounding the composer's earlier opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtensk District. Subtitled "A Soviet Artist's Response to Justified Criticism", for 10 points, name this symphony by Dmitri Shostakovich.

answer: War of the {Polish Succession}

In the run-up to this conflict, three rulers signed Lowenwolde's treaty, an agreement to back Emmanuel of Portugal. One front saw the sieges of Kehl and Philipsburg and the aborted siege to Mainz. On another front, Bonnie Prince Charlie had his first-ever experience of combat when he witnessed the siege of Gaita. On that front, an impasse over the use of forces to secure Milan led an angry Charles Emmanuel of Savoy to refuse to lend his siege weapons to the assault on Mantua. Don Carlos of Parma lost his lands but gained the throne of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in this conflict, while France gained Lorraine in exchange for recognising the pragmatic sanction and Augustus of Saxony won the central office. For 10 points, name this war in which France and Spain used Stanislaw Lesczyinski's cause as an excuse to fight Austrian power after Augustus III became king of the namesake country.

answer: {corpus callosum} [do not accept or prompt on "{brain}"]

Agenesis of this structure leads to formation of Probst Bundles. According to a formula developed by Jancke and Steinmetz, the cross-sectional area of this structure is proportional to the two-thirds power of the volume of a larger structure containing it. This structure is divided into the rostrum, genu, body, isthmus, and splenium. Current controversy exists over the contention that this structure is larger in females than in males, which if true might explain the superior development of verbal abilities in females. "Split-Brain" patients have had it surgically severed, in order to treat epilepsy by preventing the spread of seizures across the brain. For 10 points, name this wide, flat bundle of nerves which connects the hemispheres of the brain.

answer: {Lochner} v. New York [or New York v. {Lochner}]

Ronald Dworkin called this case the "whipping boy" of constitutional law. In his denunciation of Roe v. Wade, John Hart Ely turned this case into a verb and compared the approach used in this case to a "green pastel redness". This decision upheld a right previously established by Allgeyer v. Louisiana. In his dissent, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. echoed his earlier opinion in Otis v. Parker with talk of "general propositions", but differentiated the two cases through the "reasonable man" test; that dissent also claimed that "the Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Herbert Spencer's Social Statics".

answer: {Henry III} or {Henry} of {Winchester}

This monarch won his crown after hiring the mercenary Falkes de Breaute, whose seasoned troops overwhelmed his foes and captured an old Norma Fortress. This man was not crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, because that man supported Louis VIII of France's claim to the throne at the time. Instead, this monarch relied on the support of a prolifically successful tournament champion, the 1st Earl of Pembroke, William Marshal, to secure his claim by winning the aforementioned Battle of Lincoln. His decision to fund a war in Sicily to secure a title for his son Edmund eroded his support, though his major domestic opponent would be killed by this man's son at the Battle of Evesham in the Second Barons' War.

answer: {Clausius}-{Clapeyron} equation [or {Clausius}-{Clapeyron} equation before "{vaporization}"]

By the Third Law of Thermodynamics and a magnetic equivalent of this law, the critical magnetic field for a superconductor approaches a constant as temperature approaches absolute zero. This equation can be derived by showing that a Carnot engine run between two phases at two close temperatures has the same thermal efficiency. It can also be derived by finding the infinitesimal change in chemical potential for each of two phases in equilibrium with each other; that form of this equation says that the derivative of vapor pressure with respect to temperature equals the change in entropy over the change in volume. For 10 points, name this doubly-eponymous equation which gives the slope of the coexistence line in a pressure versus temperature plot.

answer: {Luminosity}

This property forms the basis of a classification scheme for active galactic nuclei developed by Fanaroff and Riley. One empirical law gives this property as a function of the velocity dispersion of an elliptical galaxy, while for spiral galaxies, it can be found from an empirical fit to the logarithm of the amplitude of maximum rotation. Given by the Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher relations for galaxies, stars for which this property exceeds the Eddington limit will be unstable. Two objects' relative magnitude is proportional to the logarithm of quotient of their values for this property, which can be found from the temperature and radius of an object via the Stefan-Boltzmann law. For 10 points, name this quantity located on the vertical axis on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, equivalent to an object's power output.

answer: {Cope} rearrangement

In 2009, Brown et. Al showed that a naphthalene-derived structure catalyzed one type of this reaction, yielding the highest enantioselectivity to date induced by the chiral cavity of a supramolecular assembly. Degenerate forms of this reaction are responsible for the single peak at 4.2 ppm of the fluxional molecule bullvalene. This observation is due to diradical transition state that preserves orbital symmetry. Proceeding only when surpafacial on all components of the reaction, this reaction also occurs in aza and oxy varieties, the latter of which produces an enol or enolate product that does not equilibrate to the regioisomer. Its diradical mechanism is both concerted and pericyclic, explaining the 300 Celsius reaction conditions needed for this process to occur. For 10 points, name this [3,3] sigmatropic thermal isomerization of a 1,5-diene yielding a regioisomeric 1,5-diene that is not the Claisen rearrangement.
