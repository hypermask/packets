answer: linear {momentum}

In quantum mechanics, this quantity for a photon is given by h-bar times the wave vector k, while its operator is given by h-bar divided by i, times the gradient. When light passes through a slit, the uncertainty in the vertical component of this quantity is given by its horizontal component times wavelength over slit width. The kinetic energy of a particle can be stated as this quantity squared over twice its mass. Because the traditional statement for Newton's second law does not account for changes in mass, that law is better stated as force equals the time derivative of this quantity. For 10 points, name this conserved quantity denoted p, equal to the product of mass and velocity.

Fluorescent dyes can be used for quantification in its real-time variety. It uses a thermocycler to change the temperature in a heat block, and incorporation of didNTPs stops elongation when it is used for sequencing. It replaced Southern hybridization for forensic analysis, and the reverse-transcriptase variety can be used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA. It requires two primers, dNTPs, and Taq polymerase, and involves cycling through denaturing, annealing, and extension steps. The amount of target DNA doubles after each cycle. Discovered by Kary Mullis, for 10 points, name this lab technique used to amplify short stretches of DNA.
