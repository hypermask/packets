answer: parabolas

This shape is the inverse curve of a cardioid. Its three-dimensional analog is given by z over c equals x squared over a squared plus y squared over b squared, and it can be represented in polar coordinates by r equals d over one plus or minus cosine theta. A method of approximating integrals using these shapes is named for Simpson. Light reflected off a mirror with this shape will be focused at a single point. Its eccentricity equals one, and it may be generated by slicing a cone with a plane parallel to a straight line along its surface. For 10 points, name this conic section which is the set of points equidistant from a line and a point, an example of which is y equals x squared.

answer: {Hess's} law [accept law of {constant heat summation} before it is mentioned]

This law explains why a catalyst does not alter the equilibrium position of a reaction. Given data such as electron affinity, heat of vaporization, and heat of ionization, this law is used in Born-Haber cycles to calculate the lattice energy of an ionic solid. This law can also be used to calculate heats of formation. It states that enthalpy is a state function, which is why it is known as the law of constant heat summation. For 10 points, name this thermodynamic law which states that the enthalpy change of a reaction equals the enthalpy of the products minus that of the reactants, named for a Swiss-born Russian chemist.

answer: {Calvin}-Benson cycle [prompt on {dark reactions}]

Its last two phases are reduction and regeneration. Important enzymes in these steps include aldolase, transketolase, and sedoheptulose bisphosphatase. C4 plants use PEP carboxylase to form oxaloacetate before beginning these reactions, allowing them to increase productivity by carboxylating more often than can C3 plants. NADPH is oxidized when it donates an electron to form G3P, which can be converted to glucose. However, five out of every six G3Ps are used to regenerate RuBP, which is attached to CO2 by Rubisco in the first step. For 10 points, name this reaction cycle that occurs in the stroma and produces sugars from carbon dioxide.
