answer: transistors

One type of these devices is described by the Ebers-Moll model, while the Early effect describes the variation in the width of the base of one of these. The Quantum Hall effect was first observed in one of these devices. The size and shape of the conductive channel determines the flow through the field-effect type of this device, subtypes of which include JFETs and MOSFETs. A more common modern variety is the bipolar junction type, which comes in n-p-n and p-n-p types and has three pins labeled emitter, collector, and base.
