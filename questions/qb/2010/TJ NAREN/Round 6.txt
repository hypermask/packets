answer: {ethanol} [or {ethyl} alcohol; prompt on "{alcohol}"]

This compound can be formed by the reaction of formaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide in an acidic solution. Since this compound forms an azeotrope in a nineteen to one ratio with water, a dehydrating agent must be used to produce the one hundred percent, or "absolute", form of this compound. It can be produced by the addition of water to ethylene, and can lose the hydrogen from its hydroxyl group to form ethoxide. When yeast enzymes react with glucose they produce two molecules of carbon dioxide and two of this molecule, which is why it is sometimes known as grain alcohol. For 10 points, name this compound with formula CH3CH2OH, the alcohol present in alcoholic beverages.

Jewish tradition teaches that it was built by King David, and is a remnant of his First Temple, though historians suggest that it was an extension of the Second Temple, a construction presided over by Herod the Great in 19 BCE. One of the names of this monument comes from the cries of Jews who mourn at its base.

answer: {lasers}

The technique of Q-switching can be used to produce a pulsed one of these devices, first demonstrated with a ruby crystal. A necessary condition for these devices to work is that they have a majority of particles in the excited state, a phenomenon known as population inversion. Steven Chu won the Nobel Prize in Physics for using these devices to cool Bose-Einstein Condensates. The operation of one of these devices involves the falling of electrons from metastable states within a mirrored cavity, eventually resulting in the emission of light of a single wavelength. For 10 points, coherent light is emitted from what device related to the MASER?

answer: {negative} numbers [or {negative integers}]

When implementing a computer system using this kind of number as the base, allowances must be made for the fact that their integer division is often rounded to zero. In Python, passing one of these numbers as the index argument of a list will return an element selected from the end of the list. In the twos-complement system, these numbers are preceded by a one; thus, a one followed by a series of zeroes can represent this kind of zero. Overflow errors can occur when a variable exceeds the maximum possible value and rolls over to one of these. For 10 points, name this kind of number contrasted with a positive number, one that is less than zero.

answer: insulin

A resistance to this hormone can be caused by polycystic ovary syndrome. The stress hormone norephinephrine inhibits it by binding to alpha-2 receptors. It increases hydrochloric acid secretion by parietal cells, lowers blood potassium levels, and causes cells to absorb more amino acids, increasing protein synthesis. Brain cells do not require it, ensuring that they will have a constant supply of fuel. It is produced by beta cells in the islets of Langerhans, and simulates body cells to increase blood glucose absorption, opposing the action of glucagon. For 10 points, name this hormone, a deficiency of which causes diabetes mellitus.

The 1077th Anti-Aircraft Division, the first line of defense during this battle, consisted of mainly female volunteers.
