answer: {transposons} [or {transposable} genetic elements; prompt on “{jumping genes}” before they're mentioned]

In bacteria, one type of them is the insertion element. P and gypsy elements are ones found in Drosophila, and two human types are LINEs and SINEs, which include Alu. Unlike the retro variety, which uses an mRNA intermediate and reverse transcriptase, the class 2 variety uses a cut-and-paste method and does not leave a copy of itself behind. They are mutagens, and can cause diseases by disrupting stretches of coding DNA. They make up 50% of the human genome, and 90% of the maize genome, where they were first discovered. For 10 points, Barbara McClintock discovered which moveable genetic elements, also known as "jumping genes"?

This philosopher stated that marriage is the union of a couple into a single moral entity in Observations on the Feelings of the Beautiful and Sublime, and he argues for moral relativism and defends the Three Maxims in another of his works. He synthesized rationalist and empiricist theories by defining a priori knowledge, which this author of the Metaphysics of Morals extended to the idea of sensus communis in his Critique of Judgment. In another work this thinker defines an ontological and a "watch-maker" proof of God's existence, and attacks the title concept's circular logic.

answer: {Draconian} Code

Under it, acts of manslaughter committed outside the capital were heard at a court in Phreatto.

answer: {potential} energy [prompt on “{potential}” before “{Lagrangian}” is read]

Velocity-dependent forces require a generalized version of this quantity, while the Lagrangian operator subtracts this quantity from a related quantity. A conservative force is equal to the gradient of this, while its electrostatic variety is measured in volts. It is often defined as zero for a charged particle an infinite distance away from a source of Coulomb force, and for a uniform gravitational force, the difference in this quantity between two positions of an object is proportional to the difference in their heights. For 10 points, name this physical concept which refers to the ability of an object to perform work, often symbolized U and contrasted with kinetic energy.

answer: {specific heat} capacity [or heat {capacity}]

One law modeling this quantity, which uses the vibration of phonons to predict a cubic temperature dependence, is named for Debye and corrects the Dulong-Petit law at low temperatures. It is defined thermodynamically as delta Q over dT. Because this quantity for water is very large, the climate near large bodies of water is often mild. This quantity may be found by a calorimeter, though an analogous mass-independent factor must be used to account for the heat absorption of the calorimeter. For 10 points, name this quantity, the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius.
