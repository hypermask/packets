answer: {Gresham's} Law

One version of it was stated by Copernicus in his Monetae cudendae ratio, but it was given its current name by Henry Dunning Macleod.

Dollarization, in which the citizens of one country use foreign currency rather than their own, is an example of this law working in reverse. The widespread use of fiat money in modern economies could be considered an example of it, though it originally only concerned economies with two forms of commodity money.

answer: {frictional} force

When this is present in a harmonic oscillator damping can occur, while approximations used to model it assume that it is independent of contact area. On the molecular scale, this phenomenon is caused by deformation of irregularities in surfaces and subsequent heat loss. This force allows a wheel to roll without slipping and has a model named for Coulomb. That model for this force states that for a body at rest it is less than or equal to the normal force times a namesake coefficient, and it has static and kinetic varieties. For 10 points, name this force which opposes sliding motion between two surfaces.

answer: {apoptosis} [accept {programmed cell death} or reasonable {variants} before it is read]

In birds, BMPs cause the onset of this, and it is often associated with increased ethylene production in plants. The growth of B and T lymphocytes necessitates this process, and it can be triggered by cytotoxic T cells. Papillomaviruses interferes with the p53 protein in the cell, which is essential to the pathway of this process, and it can lead to the formation of asymmetrical bulges in the cell membrane and DNA fragmentation. In adult humans, up to seventy billion cells are involved in this process daily, and fingers and toes differentiate in an embryo due to this which, unlike necrosis, is often advantageous. For 10 points, name this process of programmed cell death.

In order to complement the lunar crater naming system, all of the craters on this planet are named after nonscientific authors, composers, or artists. This planet has a 2:3 rotation to revolution ratio, meaning that its day is longer than its year. It is scheduled to be visited in 2020 by a joint European/Japanese mission named BepiColombo, while a hilly region known as the "Weird Terrain" is located antipodal to its Caloris Basin. The main goal of NASA's MESSENGER mission is to study this planet from orbit and to continue Mariner 10's mapping of its surface. For 10 points, identify this planet named for the Roman messenger god, the closest to the Sun.

Trouton's constant is the entropy of a certain process at it, and Duhring's plot has this property for a pure solution on the x-axis. On a coexistence curve, this property is represented by the rightmost line, whose slope is given by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Due to the fact that it is a colligative property, it is increased by the presence of solute in a solvent, and substances with significant intermolecular attractions frequently have high ones. It occurs when the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the atmospheric pressure. For 10 points, name this point which occurs at sea level for water at 100 degrees Celsius, the point of transition between a liquid and a gas.
