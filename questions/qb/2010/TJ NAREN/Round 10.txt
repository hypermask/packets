answer: {catalysts}

One of these compounds is made by treating a nickel-aluminum alloy with sodium hydroxide, while another consists of calcium carbonate treated with lead and palladium. These compounds may be poisoned when another compound binds to them, and they frequently work by providing increased surface area for adsorption. Elements such as osmium, iridium, and platinum are often used as these compounds, while biological ones are known as enzymes. Because they affect the forward and reverse reactions equally, they do not alter a reaction's equilibrium position. For 10 points, name these compounds that lower a reaction's activation energy, increasing its rate without being consumed themselves.

Theories surrounding their formation include localized heating due to asteroid impacts. Although some geologists claim their effects can be explained entirely through plate tectonics and localized interactions between the upper mantle and the crust, they are generally believed to be the product of upwelling from the lower mantle in the form of a mantle plume. When under continental crust, they tend to form powerful rhyolite volcanos such as the Yellowstone Caldera, while those under oceanic crust form weaker basalt volcanos such as Hawaii. For 10 points, name these fixed points on the Earth's surface with continuous volcanism that leave trails on moving tectonic plates.

answer: {auxin}

Synthetic versions of this hormone can be used as herbicides in eudicots. It is carried through parenchyma tissue by polar transport, which is named for the higher concentration of its transport protein at the basal ends of cells. It stimulates both cell division in the vascular cambium and root formation, but in one of its better-known functions changes in pH and membrane potential cause increased turgor and cell wall plasticity. This leads to cell elongation according to the acid growth hypothesis. The natural form of it in plants is called indoleacetic acid. FTP, name this first plant hormone to be discovered, which promotes coleoptile expansion and fruit growth.

answer: {Pythagorean} theorem

Applicable when the spread equals one, this statement can be formulated in terms of addition using rational trigonometry. A generalization of it to inner product spaces is known as Parseval's identity, while a three-dimensional generalization is de Gua's theorem. The parallelogram law simplifies to this statement in a special case, and one proof of this theorem constructs congruent triangles whose areas are half those of a square and a rectangle. It is generalized by the law of cosines to triangles with any three angles. For 10 points, name this theorem used to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, stated as A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
