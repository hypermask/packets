answer: ferromagnetism

The Ising model maps alignment of spin in substances with this property. Plutonium phosphorus is an example of an actinide compound with it, and scientists have observed that lithium gas is able to exhibit this property when cooled to almost absolute zero. Long range ordering phenomena cause unpaired electrons in materials with this property to spin parallel to each other. A material loses this property when it is heated past the Curie temperature, and it is explained by the idea of magnetic domains. For 10 points, name this permanent type of magnetism exhibited by nickel, cobalt, and its namesake element.

answer: {integration} [accept word forms; prompt on "{antidifferentiation}"]

Performing this operation in polar, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates yields a special case of the change of variables, a process which requires using a Jacobian. A generalization of this operation in measure theory is named for Lebesgue (luh-BAY). Methods for doing it numerically include the trapezoid rule, while additional techniques include doing it by parts and u-substitution. One type of this operation is evaluated at limits while another requires a namesake constant; these are the definite and indefinite types. For 10 points, name this operation from calculus often interpreted as the limit of a Riemann sum, the opposite of differentiation, used to find the area under a curve.

The earliest known example of this taxonomic group was discovered in and named for Tuang, South Africa. It used to be split into gracile and robust varieties, but the latter are now considered another group that includes the boisei species, known as Paranthropus. A set of footprints from some of its members, discovered by Mary Leakey in Laetoli, showed arched feet and non-opposable big toes, and members of this genus have been excavated in Olduvai Gorge. The most famous specimen of this genus, discovered in Ethiopia, was 3.5 feet tall and named Lucy. Studied by Raymond Dart, for 10 points, name this extinct genus of hominids with species afarensis and africanus.

answer: voltaic cell [or {galvanic} cell; prompt on "{battery}" before "{proton}"; prompt on "{electrochemical} cell" or "cell"]

A decrease in the ability of this device to operate due to the accumulation of a product is known as polarization. Primary ones are not reversible, while one reversible secondary example uses lead and lead sulfate. The reduction of a proton to hydrogen gas is a standard used to measure the favorability of reactions in this device, and one that reacts copper with copper(II) sulfate [copper two sulfate] is named for Daniell. In order to compensate for the charge imbalance within these objects, a soluble salt such as potassium nitrate is used in a salt bridge. For 10 points, name this kind of cell in which a chemical reaction produces electricity, contrasted with an electrolytic cell.

answer: {Tay}-{Sachs} disease

Its late-onset form, called LOTS, is not fatal, but its infantile and juvenile varieties are. Its symptoms resemble Sandhoff disease, but it is caused by a mutation on chromosome 15 rather than 5. Reduced activity of the enzyme hexosaminidinase A, caused by a mutation in the HEXA gene, leads to accumulation of the ganglioside GM2 in the brain's neurons. This autosomal recessive disease causes the appearance of a cherry-red spot on the retina. Other symptoms include an inability to swallow as well as blindness, deafness, and paralysis.
