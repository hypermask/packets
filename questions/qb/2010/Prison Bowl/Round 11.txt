answer: {penicillins} [prompt on {antibiotics} or {antibacterial agents}]

Probenecid is used along with this compound to slow its renal clearance and increase retention. It is synthesized from a core of 6-APA, which contains a cyclic amide of three carbon atoms and one nitrogen, a beta-lactam ring. This compound's V form is orally active, unlike the stronger G form. It binds to PBPs and inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links, which compromises the structure of the cell wall; thus it is most effective on Gram-negative bacteria. First isolated from a fungus, for 10 points, name this antibiotic discovered by Alexander Fleming.
