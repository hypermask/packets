answer: {Bernoulli's} principle, law, equation, or effect

The head equation is derived from this statement by dividing each term by the acceleration of gravity. It can be derived by integrating Euler's equation. Pitot tubes operate by this principle, which gives rise to the Venturi effect. Resulting from the law of conservation of energy, it follows from the fact that the sum of kinetic and potential energy must remain constant for all points along a streamline. It states that an increase in fluid flow accompanies a decrease in pressure. For 10 points, name this principle that partially explains the lift generated by airfoils.

answer: ideal gas law

The acentric and compressibility factors appear in one modification of this result, which can be derived using the divergence and equipartition theorems. A refinement of this law uses the empirical values a and b to account for the volume of particles, and is named for the discoverer of some intermolecular interactions, the van der Waals equation. It is a combination of Avogadro's law, Gay-Lussac's law, Charles' law, and Boyle's law, and is derived via the kinetic theory of its namesake phase of matter.

answer: {parallel} postulate [accept {Euclid's fifth} postulate before mentioned; accept " axiom " for " postulate "]

It follows from this result that any three non-colinear points lie on a circle, and that the summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are right angles. Beltrami proved its independence, and Klügel demonstrated the flaws in 28 proofs of this statement. Equivalent to Proclus' Axiom and Playfair's Axiom, its rejection led to Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann's development of hyperbolic and elliptic non-Euclidean geometries. In Euclid's Elements, it is the fifth postulate. For 10 points, name this true statement asserting the uniqueness of a line that never intersects another line.
