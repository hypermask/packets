answer: {entropy} [do not accept "{enthalphy}"]

For black holes, this quantity is proportional to the event horizon's surface area. A resolution of the Gibbs paradox gives rise to a formula for this quantity in a mono-atomic ideal gas, the Sackur-Tetrode equation. It is equal to Boltzmann's constant times natural log of the number of microstates. This quantity approaches a minimum value at absolute zero, according to the third law of thermodynamics, and always increases up to a maximum value at equilibrium, according to the second law. For 10 points, name this measure of disorder in a system.

The XK gene determines one of these named after Kell. They are defined by how glyco·syl·transfer·ases modify substance H, and they are tested for in the Coombs test. Their incompatibilities can cause alloimmunity in erythro·blastosis fetalis.
