One type of these uses zig-zig and zig-zag steps to perform a splay operation, and a set of strings can be stored in the radix type. The minimum element of another type can be removed in big O of log n time, a property utilized in a namesake algorithm, the heap sort. Kruskal's algorithm finds the minimum spanning type of this structure. The AVL and Red-Black types are self-balancing. Each node has at most two children in the binary type, a subtype of which is very efficient to search. For 10 points, name this data structure with a root at the top and leaves at the bottom.

answer: {neutrinos} [prompt on {leptons} before mentioned]

The PMNS matrix models one phenomenon involving these particles. The Homestake experiment set out to measure them, but only turned up one third the predicted number. First postulated by Pauli to explain the loss of energy in beta decay, they are detected from the Cherenkov radiation they emit at facilities such as Super-Kamiokande, which typically consist of large tanks of chlorine or heavy water. They oscillate between three flavors, which shows that they have non-zero but very low mass. For 10 points, name these uncharged leptons that come in tau, muon, and electron varieties.

answer: {photoelectric} effect

This effect governed by the Stoletov's law was first observed in a spark gap between two brass conductors. Lenard found that increased intensity has no effect on the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted particles, and that it does not occur for red light. Discovered by Hertz in 1865, it was finally explained in terms of photons by Albert Einstein, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics. For 10 points, name this effect in which shining light on a metal surface causes the emission of electrons.
