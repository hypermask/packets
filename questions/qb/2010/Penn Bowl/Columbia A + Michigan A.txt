The X(3872) particle discovered in the BELLE experiment has been theorized to be an exotic variety of this type of particle, as is the glueball hypothesized to consist of gluons only. An experiment conducted by Frisch and colleagues used a thick iron cylinder to capture one example of these particles in a proof of time dilation. A subclass of this particle that is always flavorless is quarkonium, which consists of a single type of particle, and these particles must be colorless. The simplest ones have zero spin and form a nonet that includes the flavorless nu and pi. A more famous member is K, which led to the uncovering of CP violation. Unlike baryons, they consist of an even number of quarks. For 10 points, give this name for hadrons with integer spin which are composed of a particle and its antiparticle.
