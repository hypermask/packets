answer: liver

The reaction of chloroyl-CoA with glycine is one step in the glycine conjugation pathway conducted in this organ. Those cells store Vitamin A in lipid globules in this organ, and another class of cells in this organ create glucuronic acid or sulfate through a conjugation of a free open-chain pyrrole. Gaps between fenestrated epithelia and cords in this organ are called spaces of Disse, through which blood plasma flows. This organ's Ito cells are supported by its sinusoids, which make use of macrophages called Kupffer cells. Blood is supplied to this organ from the splenic and mesenteric arteries via the portal vein. For 10 points, name this organ responsible for bile secretion that helps remove waste products from the body and which can be scarred due to alcohol abuse in cases of cirrhosis.

answer: {Poisson} distribution [or {Poissonian}; or {von Bortkiewicz} distribution early]

This distribution's moment-generating function is e raised to the product of m and quantity e to the x minus one, where m is its mean. One application of this distribution is to a construct requiring both independent increment and stationary increment assumptions. A related function based on the difference of variables following this distribution is named for Skellam and is useful in describing differences in the photon noise of two images. Fluctuation in one of its parameters is called shot noise, and its parameter denoted lambda describes both its mean and variance. Useful in modeling copy errors and waiting times, for 10 points, identify this distribution named after the Frenchman who introduced it.

Ed Kienholz included a television in his sculpture To Mourn A Dead [This], and the earliest British hill-figure is a depiction of this found at Uffington.  These animals are depicted in Alfred Stieglitz's The Terminal, and sculptures depicting this animal include Francois Girardon's Marcus Curtius Throwing himself into the Flames and the Classical-era Regisole.  A study of this animal in motion, created with a zoopraxiscope, was conducted by Edward Muybridge and proved that the "flying" posture assumed by these animals in Gericault's Epsom Derby was impossible.  For 10 points, name this animal featured in Donatello's Gattamelata, Frederic Remington's Bronco Buster and numerous other equestrian statues.

answer: {color}

The illusion theory of this property claims that it is a "virtual property", and exploits the 4+2 structure of its natural concept to claim that it does not exist in nature. P.M.S. Hacker's Simple Objectivist view of this claims it is an intrinsic quality of objects.  The dispositionalist account of this, which has roots in the writings of Descartes and Locke, claims that saying something has this is equal to saying it has some other property which makes it appear to have this to the right observer. Landesman wrote about this "and consciousness"; Frank Jackson wrote about the "primary quality view of" this, and Goethe's Theory Of [This] explained it as the interaction between light and dark.  For 10 points, name this phenomenon, seen along the entire visible wavelength from red to violet.

Before becoming a bishop, Eusebius of Dorylaeum was part of the early opposition to this belief, which was recognized by the Tang Emperor Taizong in the 7th century and aided by Peroz I, a Sassanid king. Theodore of Mopsuestia's ideas are a predecessor to this doctrine, a form of which lives on in the Assyrian Church of the East. Part of this heresy is the statement that christotokos is a better term than theotokos as well as the belief that God could not have suffered on the cross. It was condemned by Cyril of Alexandria and its namesake was excommunicated after the First Council of Ephesus. For 10 points, name this heresy that states that Jesus existed as both a person and the divine spirit Logos, named after a 5th century Patriarch of Constantinople.

One description of interactions with this group was written down in journalist Francois Bizot's The Gate. Bizot was saved by a member of this group known as Duch, who worked M-13. Duch later moved to work at this group's more notable S-21 camp, which was run by one of this group's branches, Santebal. This group's so-called intellectual member was head of the Office 870 and that man became President of the State Presidium upon its rise to power. In addition to Khieu Samphan, this group's higher ups included men in the Angkar who made use of Choeung Ek, such as Son Sen and Nuon Chea. One member of this group received the nickname “the butcher” in addition to his alias Ta Mok.

answer: {Doppler} effect [or {Doppler} shift]

A version of spectroscopy that is free of one form of this effect uses a standing wave to give radiation to a moving atom and is named for its two-photon transition. Due to this effect, atoms observe laser resonance leading to the phenomenon of optical molasses at its namesake cooling limit. Mossbauer spectroscopy uses this effect to modulate the energy of the incident gamma rays. An experiment that used a canal ray tube and a mirror to view light emissions was used to detect the transverse form of this effect, while its relativistic form involves changes equal to the square root of one plus beta over one minus beta. For 10 points, name this shift in the wavelength from a moving source that can be heard by an observer.

Louis Vierne and Olivier Latry are known for their performances of a certain Cavaillé-Coll instrument at a location with this appellation.  A school of music with this name, known to us through the writings of Anonymous IV, was representative of the ars antiqua style of polyphony and produced the Magnus Liber Organi attributed to Leonin and Perotin. One work with this appellation, written for the cathedral at Reims and performed as a memorial for the composer's brother, includes the Ite Missa Est and is the first extant polyphonic setting of the Ordinary by a single composer.  Guillame de Machaut's Mass is known by this French name which, for 10 points, refers to the Virgin Mary and names a famous cathedral in the center of Paris.
