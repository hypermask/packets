answer: {transformations} [accept {transfections} before mentioned but not “{transduction}”]

The TOP10 line has shown particularly high susceptibility to this technique in the lab. This technique can be performed on certain plants by dipping them in a solution of Agrobacterium, and other efficient methods to perform this technique involve the application of Lipofectamine or Fugene prior to it. General susceptibility to this process is termed “competence” and performing it in cold temperatures in the presence of calcium chloride improves its efficiency for less competent cells. Another common method of performing this technique is by applying a current to open up the cell membrane before placing cells in a plasmid solution. For 10 points, identify this process by which cells take up foreign pieces of DNA, examples of which include transfection and transduction.

answer: {titanium}

In the catalyst for an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation, this element's isopropoxide forms a complex with DET. This element's ability to osseointegrate has made it ubiquitous in meshes bone replacement therapies such as replacement of skull following brain surgery. It can be extracted from the ilmenite and rutile ores using either the Hunter process or a process where its tetrachloride is dropped on molten magnesium, the commercialized Kroll process. The chloride of this element is included in a complex with aluminum is useful in producing polyolefins in its role in Ziegler-Natta catalysts. For 10 points, name this corrosion-resistant transition metal with atomic number 22 and symbol Ti.

answer: The {Seagull} or {Chayka}

When one character in this play tells another that his works contain no “living characters”, he responds that artists should portray life not as it its, but as it appears in dreams.

One character suggests that his life could be made into a short story called “The Man Who Wished”. Two years elapse between the third and fourth acts, during which time one character has married the schoolteacher Medvedenko, though she still loves the protagonist.  That protagonist, Pyotr Sorin, is the brother of a retired actress, Irina Arkadina, who admits that she hasn't read any of her son's fiction.

answer: trees

The Polish notation developed by Lukasiewicz can be practically treated by representing operations by these mathematical entities. These entities can be represented numerically by Prufer codes, and Cayley's theorem states that for a given n, there are exactly n to the n-2 of these. The subset of those n vertices that are pendant in on of these objects is equal to two plus the sum of the degree of each vertex minus two. The zig, zig-zag, and zig-zig steps create the “splay” variety of these entities, while Prim's algorithm is useful for determining the minimum spanning kind. For 10 points, identify these acyclic, connected graphs which consist of a series of roots and leaves.
