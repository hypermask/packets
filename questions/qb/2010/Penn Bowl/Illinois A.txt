answer: the {Safavid} dynasty

This polity's second capital was conquered by the Ghilzay under Mahmoud, its military having been sapped by characteristic internecine conflict among the Kizilbash. This group came to power by overthrowing the Ak Koyunlu; its first ruler accomplished that by leveraging, then abandoning his position as head of the Ardab?l ??f?. Ghul?ms, tofangch?s and topch?s are the three classes created for this dynasty by Robert Sherley, who was employed by its king ‘Abb?s I, great grandson of its aforementioned founder, Ism?‘?l I. It was Ism?‘?l who set up this dynasty's capitals, Tabr?z and E?fah?n, and who instituted its policy of militantly spreading Sh?‘ism. For 10 points, name this dynasty that ruled Persia from between the early sixteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries.

answer: fluid {pressure} [prompt on {p} or {stress}]

One non-dimensional form of this variable is equal to the equivalent ideal dry-air temperature divided by the potential temperature; that non-dimensional form of this quantity is Exner function.  In inviscid atmosphere models, energy is conserved by setting the convective derivative of the energy density equal to minus the divergence of the product of this value and the fluid velocity; also in such a model, the negative gradient of this scalar function is the inhomogeneous term in the momentum equation. This quantity can be understood as one-third the trace of the hydrostatic stress tensor because each of that tensor's diagonal entries is quantity; this quantity is therefore the isotropic stress on an object in a static fluid. For 10 points, name this fluid variable, one of the primitive variables of atmospherics along with temperature, fluid velocity, and density.

In a recounting of the travels that led to this work, its author discusses a host who has a black bear as a guard dog.  Its first part shows that division of property among children and rotation in office create a so-called absolute equality central to the title structure, and observes that religion is prominent in political life precisely due to its disestablishment. The second volume of this result of a trip with Gustave de Beaumont, ostensibly to inspect prison systems, examines civil society in the title place. Taking as a central theme the idea that tyranny of the majority is a natural consequence of the titular political system, for 10 points, name this magnum opus of Alexis de Tocqueville.

Aristotle claimed that this man led Leucippus to develop atomic theory by providing an ontological argument against the possibility of a void. This person divided reality into a gentle flame and what he described as "ignorant night." In one work, this person concluded that because nothing came from nothing, nothing could be destroyed. This thinker's only surviving work is divided into two sections; one of those sections is The Way of Opinions, which describes the outside world as deceitful.

answer: DNA {Replication}

Geminin sequesters a protein responsible for initiating this process. SSB proteins are responsible for holding the substrate in this process, which in prokaryotes is terminated by Tus proteins binding to Ter sites. In Eukaryotes it's initated by the recruitment of MCM proteins following the recruitment and phosphorylation of cdc6, which in turn leads to the ORC complex falling apart. The Klenow fragment is a cleaved version of an enzyme used by E. Coli to undergo this process, which in Eukaryotes uses Pol alpha, delta, and epsilon. The nature of this process was determined in an experiment that grew E. Coli on N-15 media, and in eukaryotes it requires the formation of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. For 10 points, name this process that creates a namesake fork, in which an organisms genome is copied.

This person was the second of three monarchs served by Pierre Terrail, Chevalier de Bayard, whose successes allowed this ruler to sign the Treaty of Granada with Ferdinand II of Aragon, though the portions of Milan subsequently partitioned to this king were soon lost. Documents from this king's reign include testimony in his divorce from the misshapen Jeanne de France, which he undertook to marry Anne of Brittany; he would eventually die allegedly from bedroom exertions with his third wife, Mary Tudor. This co-founder of the League of Cambrai's retraction of the hand of his daughter Claude de France from future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V ensured continuation of the Italian Wars inherited from Charles VIII and eventually lost by Francis I. For 10 points, name this only Orléans-Valois King of France.

answer: Gibbs Free Energy

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation assumes the change in this to be zero. Because this quantity is most useful when the substance in question is both isothermal and isobaric, a different quantity is used for explosive substances. An equation partially due to the namesake of this quantity gives the temperature dependence of this quantity for an ideal gas. A zero change in this quantity for a system implies that the system is in equilibrium, but a negative value for this quantity implies that a reaction is spontaneous. One may derive this by utilizing the Legendre transform on the internal energy of a system. For ten points, name this state function named for its American inventor, which measures the maximum amount of work attainable from a system, defined as enthalpy minus the product of temperature and entropy.

One work by this man begins in the bassoons, but that theme is quickly subdued by a Trumpet Fanfare remnant of this composers' National Hymn.  Another work by this composer was edited by its original soloist, adding repeats to the theme and cutting off the coda.  This composer of the Marche Slave and Variations on a Rococo Theme for cello and orchestra wrote a Fifth Symphony whose scrapped program asks "shall I cast myself into the embrace of faith???" and uses a cyclical "Fate" motif. His final symphony features a 5/4 time second movement which has been called a "limping waltz", and ends with an Adagio Lamentoso.  For 10 points, identify this composer of the Symphony #6 "Pathetique" and the 1812 Overture.

One contest saw him leverage contacts in the Alliance of Builders to overcome a certain rival. Another opponent to this person planned on creating a so-called moj, now known as the pan-Green movement.

This group probably overran the cities of its predecessors, the Villanovans, including Felsina, until its expansion was checked by defeat at the hands of Aristodemus of Cumae. Following another battle, this confederation took the hostage Cloelia, who subsequently escaped. The mutually recognized need to maintain defenses against these people led to the agreement to hold the combat of the Curiatti and Horatii proposed by Tullus Hostilius and accepted by the Albans.

answer: matrix {decomposition} or matrix {factorization}

One way of performing of a process of this sort involves taking the square root of a pivot matrix, multiplying it with the transpose of a certain type of matrix, and multiplying that product by its transpose. The most common way of calculating the pseudoinverse can be easily calculated after performing another type of this process on a matrix because the pseudoinverse of an eigenmatrix is simple to calculate. Those processes for doing this activity on matrices respectively called Cholesky and the singular value one. Another method of doing this action begins by using an augmented matrix then proceeds to eliminate using pivots in both entries until it yields a canonical form of an upper triangular and lower triangular matrix. For 10 points, name this operation which includes the “LU” variety, which is the separation of a matrix into a product of two matrices.

Nine of the prisoners from this battle were hanged by an illegitimate court martial that was subsequently disbanded by Isaac Shelby. Those hangings and near-starvation conditions on a march to Camp Salem motivated the escape of almost all of the prisoners. One force at this clash had recently been victorious at Musgrove Mill, having formed to avenge the Waxhaws Massacre.
