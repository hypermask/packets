Adding DBU to a solution of 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene is a popular method of purifying these compounds, and Ottero and Biddau have recently described a direct synthesis of them via cyclohydrogenation. One type of these molecules has optical properties described by the Kataura plot and has zigzag, chiral, and armchair configurations. Azomethane ylides are utilized in the Prato 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of these molecules while the Bingel reaction is a widely used method for the cyclopropanation of this class of molecules. Synthesized using the Humann-Kratschmer method of arc-discharge, laboratory purification of these compounds often involves columns of Elorit carbon. While aromatic in nature, their spherical variety's inability to delocalize over the entire molecule leads to slight anionic character. Found as rings, clusters, and nanotubes, this is, for ten points, what class of molecule named for an architect and includes its most famous member, C60.

Sarin and Hobert used Illumina sequencing in these organisms instead of positional cloning to identify mutants in a forward screen, and mutagenesis in these organisms is usually carried out by adding EMS to their growth media. Their gonads can be microinjected in order to create knockout lines, and RNAi constructs can be fed to these organisms via E. Coli. Its development is partly controlled by the lin-4 miRNA, and mutants include dumpy, roller, and unc. They can shift into a dormant dauer state but usually go through the larval stages L1 through L4 before hitting maturity. Used by Horvitz to study apoptosis, these organisms were popularized by Brenner. Occuring as only hermaphrodites or males, every cell in the adult has been fate-mapped. For 10 points, name this common model organism, a nematode.

This event was made possible by a curse laid on the men of one country by the wife of Crundchu when she was made to run a race against horses while pregnant.

Two expressions in system are alpha-equivalent if they can be made literally the same by changing bound variables. The startup incubator Y Combinator is named after the fixed point operator in this language, used to create recursion. Since terms in the language consist entirely of variables and functions, numbers are implemented as "numerals" named after the language's inventor. Its inventor used the undecidability of equivalence in this Turing-complete model of computation to give a negative answer to Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem in 1936, soon after Turing's own answer based on the Halting Problem.
