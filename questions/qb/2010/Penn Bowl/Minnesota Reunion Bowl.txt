answer: {Microtubules}

Vinca alkaloids target these structures, whose formation in Xenopus eggs is controlled by XMAP215. A structure containing six HEAT repeats called the TOG domain is present in proteins that interact with them, and the tektins also associate with these structures. Their monomers, which are homologous to FtsZ, .contain an alpha and beta subunit that binds to GTP, and their creation relies on a gamma-ring complex. Targeted by taxol and colchicine, these structures undergo assembly and disassembly in a process called dynamic instability. Found in the spindle apparatus, they are in a 9+2 arrangement in flagella. For 10 points, name these strands of polymerized tubulin, a component of the cytoskeleton.

answer: The {Ethics}

This work discusses a stone falling on a man's head, which its author argues should not be explained by the will of God, which is a “sanctuary of ignorance.” Its third section defines emotions as ideas that cause the mind to act and suffer, and which increase, diminish, help, or hinder the mind's faculties, and it contrasts necessary laws, or "infinite modes", with non-universal "finite modes". This work defines God as consisting of “infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite essence”. Presented in a Euclid-imitating “geometrical order,” it contains the section “Of Human Bondage.” For 10 points, name this book that, like the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, was written by Baruch Spinoza.

In one section of this work, “legs waken salads in the brain” while “you pick your blonde out neatly through the smoke”; that section is the second of three variations on a woman variously called Mary and Magdalene. Its fourth section asks if “infinity / Be still the same as when” a certain figure “walked the beach / Near Paumanok,” while the speaker of its penultimate section encounters a “visage” with “eyes like agate lanterns” and asks that figure “did you deny the ticket?” In addition to addressing Whitman and Poe, this poem exhorts the reader to “stick your name on a patent signboard” in “Powhatan's Daughter” and adopts the perspective of Christopher Columbus in “Ave Maria.” It opens with a “Proem” dedicated to the title object and contains sections called “The Tunnel,” “Cape Hatteras,” and “Cutty Sark.” For 10 points, identify this modernist epic about a Brooklyn landmark, a work of Hart Crane.

answer: {transition} states

The synchronous transit and nudged elastic band methods are used to find these entities on a given PES, and analogues to these general chemical constructs include the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. An experiment by Polanyi which mapped the potential surface between a hydrogen radical and a hydrogen molecule was important in developing the theory concerning these states, which are represented on the dot of the diagonal of a More O'Ferrall Jencks plot. The difference in the free energy of these states is the subject of the Curtin-Hammett principle. A statement sometimes named for Leffler claims that the structure of this entity resembles the species nearest to it in energy. For 10 points, name these chemical intermediates, the energy at which can be found using the Arrhenius equation, sometimes known as activated complexes.

One of these works by this composer is dubbed "Cello" for its unaccompanied lower-register opening, while the use of minor second intervals led another of these to be dubbed “Wrong Note.” Leopold Godowsky composed a set of 53 arrangements of these works, the final examples of which are known as the “Three New” ones. An F-natural in the fifth of these works is the only note not played on the titular “Black Keys,” while the best-known of them opens with a dramatic C-minor chord and was written after its composer heard of the failure of his home country in the November Uprising. Exemplified by the “Revolutionary” one, for 10 points, identify these piano exercises written by Frédéric Chopin.

One model developed by this man gives the probability of a transition between a two-level quantum mechanical system in terms of the diabatic coupling constants. Another behavior named for him occurs when electrons traveling at speeds approximately equal to the phase speed of a wave do not participate in resonant interactions with the wave; that phenomenon thus allows for collisionless decay of plasma waves, which is called his namesake “damping.” He names a value at which the coupling constant of a quantum field interaction blows up, and his experiments on liquid helium led to a phenomenological theory of superfluidity. For 10 points, identify this physicist, who developed a theory of superconductivity with Vitaly Ginzburg.

D.T. Britt's database of the densities of these objects shows that their densities converge around the traditional estimate of two grams per cubic centimeter. These objects are subject to the Tholen spectral classification, which was supplemented by the 2002 SMASS classification. Both of those spectral classifications break them down into three main types, C-Group, S-Group, and X-Group. Prominent absences of these objects are found at the four-to-one, three-to-one, and five-to-two orbital resonances of a certain body. These objects are not present in Kirkwood Gaps, and the ones found at Jupiter's Lagrange points are called the “Trojans.” For 10 points, name these objects in space that are found in a namesake “belt” between Mars and Jupiter.
