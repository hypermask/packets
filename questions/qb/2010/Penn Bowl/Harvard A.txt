answer: {Paramagnetism}

Invitrogen Dynabeads have this property and are useful for immunoprecipitation assays, and nanobeads with this property can be used for solid-phase cDNA generation. MRI contrast agents often have this property, and a gas of monatomic hydrogen atoms would display a pure form of it. Molecular orbital theory is required to show that diatomic oxygen has it. Ferrofluids display the super- form of this behavior, which is described by the equation M equals chi times H, in which chi is positive. This property occurs above the Curie and Neel temperatures in certain materials, in which spins are randomly aligned until an external field is applied. For 10 points, name this type of magnetism.

A metric version of this problem is the subject of the Christofides algorithm. This problem may be solved by a generalization of 2-opt that involves pairwise exchange, the Lin-Kerninghan method. Yet another solution can be derived using the elastic net method, where a circle is repeatedly mapped and stretched in the plane. One solution to it is the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, which involves going from the current point to the adjacent edge with the lightest weight. It is equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph, and the Chinese postman problem is a dual of this problem.
