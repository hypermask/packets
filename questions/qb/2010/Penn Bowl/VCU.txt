answer: {superconductors} [accept {type II superconductors}, but not “{type} I”]

The first organic material of this type produced, (TMTSF)2PF6, has been shown to resist external quenching. Defects facilitate these materials' maintenance in a state with 300 nanometer normal cores. That is the characteristic vortex state exhibited in one class of these materials between two critical temperatures. In what is termed solid solutions, these devices can be constructed from lanthanum-copper-oxide or yttrium-barium-copper-oxide. Two of them separated by a thin insulating layer can experience tunneling of condensed electron pairs through a Josephson junction, and these devices are capable of becoming perfectly diamagnetic at their transition temperature, which allows them to completely expel magnetic fields in the Meissner Effect. For 10 points, name these devices typically operating at very low temperatures where they experience no electrical resistance.

answer: Congress of Berlin

The man who called for this meeting had earlier issued a namesake note concerning the treatment of Christians in Ottoman territories. One delegation parleyed their support of another side into the secret Cyprus Convention, and this meeting saw Romania lose South Bessarabia in exchange for Dobruja. Greater Bulgaria was separated into North Bulgaria, Macedon, and Eastern Rumelia at this meeting. Though Serbia, Montenegro, and Romania all gained independence, they all paid with a loss of territory. Turkey was allowed to keep control of its land on Bulgaria's coast on the Aegean, possibly due to no Balkan nations attending. For 10 points, name this 1878 meeting convened to redo the Treaty of San Stefano following the Russo-Turkish War and held in a German city.

answer: {alkenes} [or {olefins}]

One method of producing this functional group involves an elimination and then expulsion of sulfur dioxide from an alpha-halo sulfone in the Ramberg-Backlund reaction. Also produced form the treatment of tosylhydrazones with strong base in the Bamford-Stevens reaction, this functional group changes positions in the Cope rearrangement. Shrock carbenes and Fischer carbenes catalyze a reaction switching the substituents of two of these compounds, and Lindlar's catalyst is used to produce their cis examples stereoselectively. They are most easily produced in Zaitsev elimination of alkyl halides, and two of them are crossed in a namesake metathesis. For 10 points, name these compounds with formula CnH2n, the simplest example of which is ethylene.

During this event, the popular anthem “The Awakening of the People” was sung by members of a group known as “The Gilded Youth.” The three days following it saw the muscadins lead the execution of 104 people in the White Terror. Two months prior to this action, its antagonist established the Festival of the Supreme Being in order to replace Christian traditions. The antagonist of this action was arrested at the Hotel de Ville along with his brother after speaking the previous day before the National Convention. Paul Barras and others led the rebels in this event, which ultimately saw the Directory replace the Committee of Public Safety and the beheading of Robespierre.

answer: gods of {thunder} [accept {lightning}]

In ancient Rome, cakes were offered to Summanus, a deity associated with this phenomenon, and another deity of this type left behind rocks known as his “arrows” after fighting a water serpent that kidnaps his wife and children. Besides that enemy of Veles, the Norse deity of this phenomenon was only able to wrestle an old woman named Elli to one knee. A Greek god of this entity was able to manifest it after releasing the Cyclopes from Tartarus, who brought him the standard bearers of this, which were previously hidden by Gaia. Another deity linked to this phenomenon is slated to die from Jormungand's poison and may it with his hammer Mjollnir. For 10 points, name this weather phenomenon associated with such gods as Perun, Thor, and Zeus and often paired with lightning.

answer: {Cepheid variables} [accept {variable stars} before “{RR}”]

An early explanation for the behavior of these astronomical objects involved the existence of a conductive ionized-hydrogen zone capable of functioning as a heat engine; however, Eddington's model, also called the kappa-mechanism, provided insufficient energy absorption. Baker and Kippenhahn later demonstrated that helium ionization could serve as a viable mechanism for the characteristic properties of these entities. Hubble studied them in Andromeda and Triangulum to note that those galaxies were not part of the Milky Way. Unlike the similar RR Lyrae class, which are also found in the instability strip, stars in this class have a period ranging from 1 to 50 days. Useful as standard candles as noted by Henrietta Leavitt, for 10 points, name this class of variable stars.

This work responds to what it terms the ‘”laziness” of a certain philosopher's “principle of least action” by claiming that the statement “Quality q is at x; y; z; t” can never be translated into the world of sense data. This work references Frege's example of “Morning Star” and “Evening Star” and Bertrand Russell's discussion of “Scott” and “The Author of Waverly”. It also discusses Carnap's Aufbau in the later section “The Verification Theory and Reductionism”. This paper not only attacks reductionism, but also uses the phrase “No bachelor is married” to attacking the logical positivists' distinction between analytic truths and synthetic truths, the other title concept. For 10 points, name this essay by Willard Van Orman Quine.

answer: ribosomes

These organelles contain a protein called trigger factor that aid their function, and they bind a namesake recycling factor upon carrying out their function. The activity of these organelles can be muted by chloramphenicol. The G-protein EF-G mimics the structure of molecules usually found in this organelle. Those molecules, which are brought to this organelle by EF-Tu, are produced by the enzyme aaRS, and the fact that these organelles can yield variable results is part of the wobble hypothesis. One of those molecules bound to an initiator fMet makes its way into the P-site of this organelle and interacts with another molecule in the A-site to generate a nascent peptide chain. For 10 points, name these organelles that function on mRNA and stud rough ER, the sites of protein synthesis in the cell.
