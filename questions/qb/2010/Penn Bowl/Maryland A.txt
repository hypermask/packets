answer: {Raman} scattering [accept {Raman Effect} , or {Raman Spectroscopy} , prompt on {inelastic scattering} , prompt on {Stokes scattering} before mentioned]

Interference in applications of this effect is often mitigated using a 785 nanometer light source to reduce competition with fluorescence. This effect is most prevalent when, for at least one component, there is a non-zero derivative of the rho-sigma component of the polarizability tensor with respect to the normal coordinate of vibration at equilibrium. The selection rule for the related spectroscopy requires delta J be plus or minus two or zero, and it can be augmented via interaction with surface plasmons. This effect proceeds by inducing a virtual excited state, which relaxes producing a peak slightly below and a weaker one slightly above the Rayleigh peak. Those are Stokes and Anti-stokes lines in its spectra. For 10 points, name this type of inelastic scattering discovered by an Indian physicist in 1928.

answer: {aldosterone}

A study by Trune and Kempton linked this hormone and prednisolone to autoimmune hearing loss. Spironolactone and eplerenone antagonize receptors for this hormone, and the Captopril suppression test involves muting this hormone's production to investigate its hyperactivation. This hormone is oversecreted in a form of hypertension called Conn's Syndrome, and both this and cortisol are deficient in Addison's disease. By inducing angiotensin secretion, renin indirectly promotes this hormone's release from the zona glomerulosa in a certain feedback system. Its primary purpose is to stimulate ion pumps.  For 10 points, name this hormone secreted from the adrenal cortex which promotes the reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys.

answer: {aldol} condensation [accept {aldol reaction}]

Chalcones are produced via this reaction between benzaldehyde and derivatives of acetophenone. One mode for controlling selectivity in this reaction is the avoidance of syn-pentane forms in its transition state according to a model proposed by Zimmerman and Traxler. That model is not followed by a reaction using silyl enol ethers to add to aldehydes in this type of reaction named for Mukaiyama. The product of this reaction readily dehydrates to form an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, an enone or enal. This reaction follows a Michael addition in the Robinson annulation. Its first step under basic conditions is the abstraction of the alpha hydrogen from an aldehyde to form an enolate. For 10 points, name this condensation reaction whose product has characteristics of both aldehydes and alcohols.
