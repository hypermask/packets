answer: {Pituitary} Gland

Craniopharyngioma is a type of tumor of this organ that develops from the remnants of Rathke's pouch. This organ sits in a saddle-shaped depression known as the sella turcica.

Diabetes Insipidus is caused by an underproduction of a hormone produced by this organ that regulates the amount of water in the blood, vasopressin. The aforementioned Sheehan syndrome normally only affects the anterior part of this gland because the posterior part has a direct arterial supply of blood.

answer: {Glucose} [or C6H12O6 before read]

This compound is used as precursor in the Reichstein process in which it undergoes hydrolysis into sorbital with the ultimate goal of creating Vitamin C. Derivatives of this simple compound are represented by Haworth projections and are able to form alpha or beta linkages at its anomeric carbon. This compound and mannose are produced from the Kiliani-Fischer synthesis acting on arabinose.

The mass distribution of objects newly created by this process follows a power law with exponent negative 2.35 according to the Salpeter function, which is a form of initial mass function. Small remnants of this process are known as Herbig-Haro objects, and regions in which this process occurs a lot include Rho Ophiuchi. Bok globules are opaque regions in which this process occurs, and this process requires a molecular cloud to expand beyond the Jeans length, then collapse.
