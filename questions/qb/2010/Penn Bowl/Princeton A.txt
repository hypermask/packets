Also responsible for the passage of the Combination Act, this figure tried John Horne Tooke, John Thelwall, and Thomas Hardy for treason.  He resigned to allow Henry Addington into power, and he became Chancellor of the Exchequer under the Shelburne ministry. In his first ministry, the king's distrust of Charles James Fox and Lord North allowed him to stay in power. This prime minister had Great Britain join the Third Coalition, which during his tenure would win at Trafalgar before being defeated at Austerlitz. For 10 points, name this youngest ever British PM, who was also the son of the Earl of Chatham, a previous prime minister.

Along with Preston North End's 1888-89 team, this team's 2003-04 iteration is one of two teams ever to win the top division of their country's soccer league without losing a match, and they were called “The Invicibles” because of this feat. That season's team played their home games in a stadium located in Highbury, in contrast to their new stadium named for their current jersey sponsor. Their current manager, the second-longest tenured manager in the Premier League and the only non-British manager to ever win the league and the FA Cup in the same season, pioneered a new brand of smooth passing and attacking soccer, helped by his fellow Frenchman and the club's all-time leading scorer, Thierry Henry.

answer: {Rain}, {Steam}, and {Speed} – The {Great Western} Railway

Two rectangular forms dominate, one lighter and the other darker, both receding into the canvas. The lighter one moves diagonally into a misted central area. Soft, warm, and cool colors, combined with rapid brushstrokes, cover the entire canvas and give the appearance of a misty haze. On top of the larger, darker rectangular form is a smaller and darker circular shape with an even darker rectangular shape protruding from the top. The location of the work is generally thought to be over the River Thames on the Maidenhead Railway Bridge. Name this work found in the National Gallery, by J. M. W. Turner that depicts a train going over a bridge on a moist day.

He forced the three sons of his brother Daniyal to convert to Christianity and sent Sunder Dass to capture a fort at Kangra after previously foiled attempts. This Sunni alcoholic ended up blinding one of his sons for rebelling against him, and Khusrau would eventually be killed by his brother to eliminate any threat to his succession to the throne.

This work claims that all sciences start from two types of data, one of which is identified as "ground of being" in "organon", the other of which is its "problem". The idea that both passion and intensity of emotion are unknowable to “the brute” appears in the section “Objective View of the Intellect” of this work, which also mentions the “medium of motives”; while this work's second volume consists of supplements to each of the first volume's four books.  Defining one of the title concepts as a “striving, yearning, force”, this work claims that daily life "is suffering" and combines consideration of the Kantian “ding an sich” with the Upanishads.  For 10 points, name this magnum opus of Arthur Schopenhauer.

answer: Battle of Agincourt

An impartial white-clad knight named Montjoie served as a herald in this battle. Prior to it, one commander set only a small contingent to guard his wagons, which led to the theft of that man's crown by Ysembart. Fearing the release of captured prisoners to engage his troops in this battle, one side's commander issued the controversial order “Let everyone of my lances kill his French prisoner.” The winning side was aided by a muddy battlefield which slowed down the superior opposing cavalry as they charged headlong into a series of pikes. Seeing the death of Charles d'Albret, this battle led to the signing of the Treaty of Troyes five years later.

This effect is useful in power sensing because it performs analog multiplication, and in plasmas its coefficient is equal to the gyrofrequency divided by the heavy particle collision frequency. A Jet of xenon gas is used in a type of thruster that uses this effect, while one version of it can be observed in MOSFETs, when its namesake voltage becomes quantized and which can be used to define the von Klitzing constant. Its namesake coefficient is the ratio of the applied electric field to the product of the current density measured times the applied magnetic field. Originally used to find the sign of charge carriers, for 10 points, name this effect that produces a voltage difference across an electric conductor transverse to the electric current.

One multi-component reaction to create them combines a ketone or aldehyde, a carboxylic acid, and an isocyanide in a reaction named for Passerini. Oximes can be converted to them by heating with sulfuric acid or phosphorus pentachloride in the Beckmann rearrangement, and these can be converted into carbamic acid via attempted halogenation of primary versions of these by the Hofmann rearrangement. These can also by synthesized by a reaction that uses a base to absorb the acidic proton on the nitrogen atom in an intermediate, after the addition of the carbonyl group of a acid chloride to an amine, the Schotten-Baumann reaction.

answer: {polymerase chain reaction} [accept {real}-{time PCR} or {RT}-{PCR} until “{touchdown}”]

One way to quantify this procedure's results is the delta-delta Ct method, where Ct is the threshold. The proofreading ability of Pfu is sometimes preferred to another reagent in this technique. Progressively reducing temperature over the course of this technique serves to remove unwanted background in its touchdown variant. Determining the initial amount of sample can be done by generating a series of logistic curves to compare to internal standards in its real-time variant. This procedure goes through denaturation, annealing, and elongation steps through several cycles, and reagents required for it include forward and reverse primers, as well as dNTPs, and a certain enzyme denoted Taq. For 10 points, name this technique used to amplify DNA, developed by Kary Mullis.
