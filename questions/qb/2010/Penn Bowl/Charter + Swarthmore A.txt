answer: {Estonia}

Out of this country's 1520 islands, the two largest are Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, which are also popular vacation spots. In the southeast of this country is its highest point, Suur Munamagi, which is roughly translated to English as Egg Hill. Its largest lake, Lake Peipus forms much of the border between this country and Russia, from which this country achieved independence in 1920 through the Treaty of Tartu. This country has been the setting of a battle in the Livonian War as well as in the Great Northern War, and that location is also the namesake for the largest river in the country. The Narva flows along its border with Russian until it empties into the Gulf of Finland. For 10 points, name this Baltic country with capital at Tallinn.

answer: {introns} or {intragenic region} or {intervening sequence}

Trypanosomes deal with these entities in a mechanism involving the SL molecule, and that mechanism typically involves BBP binding to these entities. During their elimination, they associated with U6 and U2 particles, unlike the U12-mediated elimination of them seen in many mammals. They are typically flanked by GU and AG regions, and attachment of various small nuclear RNPs around these facilitates the formation of a lariat structure when phosphodiester bonds are generated between their ends in the spliceosome. That process removes these sequences to form mature RNA. For 10 points, name these non-coding regions within DNA.

answer: {Symmetry} (accept {T}-{symmetry} or {Time Reversal Invariance} until *, accept {invariance throughout})

Kramers' theorem states that a system must be doubly degenerate if its Hamiltonian has one type of this property. Any field theory in which this property holds for the Lagrangian, but not for the physical vacuum, must contain * massless bosons by Goldstone's theorem. A local gauge's spontaneous loss of this property results in the acquisition of mass by W and Z bosons in the Higgs mechanism. Noether's theorem states that there is a conservation law associated with every continuous one of these. The existence of corresponding bosons and fermions is its hypothetical “super “ variety. FTP name this property, invariance under transformations.

answer: {Existence} of {Free Will}

St. Augustine defended this doctrine in a dialogue with Evodius.  Luis de Molina argued for this doctrine using the concept of God's “middle knowledge.” John Wesley angered George Whitfield by rejecting a belief in total depravity as contrary to this concept. St. Augustine rejected the version of this concept advanced by Pelagius, claiming it amounted to a rejection of original sin and divine grace. In the Consolation of Philosophy Boethius used the claim that God is timeless to reconcile this concept with divine foreknowledge. For 10 points, name this concept, which Jonathan Edwards argued was incompatible with predestination, the ability to determine one's own fate.

answer: {ether}

As heterocyclic chemical compounds, rings containing multiples of this functional group are useful as phase transfer catalysts. A special, especially reactive class of these can be formed by the reaction of trifluoroperacetic acid with an alkene. Other classes of this functional group include ketals and acetals. Its 120 degree bond angle results in a dipole. A common synthesis technique features the deprotonation of an alcohol, which subsequently reacts with an alkyl-halide. Other means of synthesis include Ullman condensation and the dehydration of alcohols. Used to link the monomers of carbohydrates, this functional group also serves as a both a Lewis and an Bronstead base. For 10 points, identify this functional group which is an alkoxy-substitued alkyl, alkene, or alkyne: an oxygen atom linking the carbons of two hydrocarbons.
