answer: {histidine}

This molecule's 3-methyl derivative is prevalent in actin and myosin and is used as a marker to detect starvation. A thiamine deficiency can cause an excess of ammonia to be produced as a result of the metabolism of this compound, of which wbuZ is a side product and urocanic acid is a main product. The Ames test is used to detect disruption of the synthesis of this molecule, which, along with beta-alanine, is a component of the dipeptide carnosine. Along with cysteine, tyrosine, and arginine, it is an essential amino acid in children but not in adults, and its side chain has a pKa of about 6.5. Coordinated to iron in hemoglobin, for 10 points, name this amino acid with a positively charged imidazole side chain and is abbreviated His.

answer: the {Heart} of {Prajnaparamita} Sutra or the {Heart} of {Perfect} Wisdom Sutra

The name by which this Prajnaparamita, or Perfection of Wisdom text, is now known originates in a 649 CE Chinese translation by Xuanzang, although it may have been composed in the first centry CE. Framing text attributes its 14 shlokas to Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, who answers the monk Sariputra. Its conclusions, including the Four Noble Truths, build on the observation that form, feeling, will, thought, and consciousness are all sunyata, or emptiness. The mantra "gone, gone, gone over, gone fully over. Awakened! So be it!" ends, for 10 points, this work which, along with Diamond Sutra, is central to Mahayana Buddhism.

answer: {utilitarianism}

A so-called "Ideal" formulation of this doctrine was promulgated in 1907 by Hastings Rashdall. In Reasons and Persons, Derek Parfit outlines the "repugnant conclusion," which results from strict adherence to this doctrine. The "Meaning" and "Proof" of this doctrine are discussed in Henry Sidgwick's Methods of Ethics, and a book by J.J.C. Smart and Bernard Williams that aims to defend the "act," variety of this doctrine, which is often contrasted with its "rule" variety. Best known from a work which sets forth the Greatest Happiness Principle, for 10 points, identify this doctrine promoted by Jeremy Bentham and J.S. Mill, which holds that the most ethical actions produce the greatest good for the greatest number.

answer: quantum state {transitions}

According to the adiabatic approximation, the probability of these events tends to zero for arbitrarily slowly varying perturbations. For a general perturbation, the probability of one of these events taking places can be calculated using Fermi's golden rule. These cannot occur in atomic systems between states of identical parity according to Laporte's rule, and in general these events are restricted to particular quantum numbers by selection rules. The energy absorbed or released by one of these events can be calculated for hydrogen from Rydberg's formula. For 10 points, identify these events which occur when an electron absorbs or emits a photon and thereby changes its quantum state.

answer: thyroid gland

Two of its products play a role in fetal brain maturation, and OATP1C1 and MTC8 have been implicated in their transport across the blood-brain barrier. In humans, this organ is on the same plane as the cricoid cartilage, and its namesake superior artery emerges from a point above the origin of the ascending pharyngeal, lingual, and facial arteries. Its follicular cells secrete tyrosine derivatives, its parafollicular cells secrete calcitonin, which is opposed by PTH produced by four glands embedded in its surface. Triiodothyronine and thyroxine, or T3 and T4, are the primary products of, for 10 points, this butterfly-shaped organ, which may develop a goitre because of iodine deficiency.

answer: {risk} [accept word forms like {risk}-{taking}]

Friedmann and Savage developed a model relating the shape of the utility function to income levels characterizing the "premium" associated with this phenomenon, and John Harsanyi argued that the cardinal utility function used in welfare economics was closely related to the cardinal utility function used in the theory of this phenomenon.  The tendency to avoid this phenomenon is estimated with ratio of the second derivative of the utility function to its first derivative in a model named for Arrow and Pratt; Markowitz's portfolio selection model identifies this with variance, while Frank Knight contrasted it with "uncertainty" by asserting that it could be measured. For 10 points, identify this concept from economics which indicates what an agent stands to lose or gain from an uncertain outcome, and which cautious people may be "averse" to.

This quantity over certain closed loops must be greater than 4pi according to the Fary-Milnor theorem. For 3-dimensional manifolds, the shape operator is an extrinsic type of this quantity, while its determinant is an intrinsic type. This quantity and torsion are coefficients for calculating the derivatives of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors of a curve according to the Frenet-Serret formulas. This quantity is the inverse of the radius of a curve's osculating circle. This quantity can be measured using the Ricci or Riemann tensors, and the aforementioned determinant is the Gaussian type of this quantity.

One of this type of reaction uses iron catalysts to produce amines from aromatic nitro compounds, and azides produce imines when they undergo this type of reaction. In addition to the Bechamp one, another one of these proceeds by a chiral oxazaborolidine and borane catalyst and produces alcohols from ketones, while yet another uses a barium sulfate catalyst to produce aldehydes from acid chlorides. In addition to the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata and Rosenmund ones, another one of these that uses a zinc catalyst deoxygenizes aldehydes and ketones in acidic conditions and is complementary to another that produces alkanes under basic conditions. For 10 points, name this class of reactions that includes those named after Clemmensen and Wolff-Kishner, the opposite of an oxidation.
