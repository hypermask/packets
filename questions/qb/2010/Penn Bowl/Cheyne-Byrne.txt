answer: center

For a Lie algebra, this term defines the set of all elements a such that, for all elements in the algebra, the commutation operation between a and any of those elements yields zero. On a graph, this point is sometimes named for Jordan and is the set of all vertices with minimal eccentricity. Euler lines by definition pass through this point of the nine-point circle. In group theory, this term applies to the members of a group that commute with every other member and is often denoted Z, while the altitudes of a triangle meet at the point called the ortho- this. For 10 points, give this name, which, in geometry defines a position whose distance from the edge of a circle is the radius, since it is exactly in the middle.

Grice has criticised this work's Part II discussion of "seeing" for confusing semantics and pragmatics, and that section uses the examples of a fork and an optical illusion.  Part I of this work consists of 693 brief paragraphs and opens with a quote from Aristotle's Confessions, and this book uses the metaphor of a "beetle-in-a-box" to argue against the concept of a private language.  Famous for its duckrabbit and a discussion of "language games", for 10 points, name this posthumous work by the author of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Ludwig Wittgenstein.

answer: special {relativity}

One consequence of this theory is that the hyperbolic tangent of the sums of rapidities is equivalent to the sums of their hyperbolic tangents divided by one plus the product of their hyperbolic tangents. That equation closely parallels one concerning composition of velocities as a consequence of this theory. Transformation of coordinates in this theory is aided by Minkowski matrices which incorporate a factor equivalent to one over the square root of one minus beta squared. That factor divides the proper length to explain a phenomenon predicted in this theory and named for Lorentz and Fitzgerald. For 10 points, name this theory developed by Einstein describing length contraction and time dilation associated with objects traveling at near-light speeds.

answer: Jean-Philippe {Rameau}

Among his six surviving cantatas are Orphee and Le berger fidele.  His instrumental music advanced beyond the style luthe of his predecessors and eschewed chaconnes in favor of rondeaux and binary forms, as seen in works for harpsichord such as Pieces des clavecin and arrangements from his Les Indes galantes. He unsuccessfully attempted to find an overtone-series basis for the minor triad in one of the first works to systematically analyze tonal music theory. This author of the Traite de l'harmonie was a major participant in a dustup prompted by the performance of Pergolesi's opera buffa La Serva Padrona in Paris, the Querelle des Bouffons.

answer: IR spectroscopy [or {infrared} spectroscopy]

Preparation of certain polymers for this technique typically involves dissolving in a non-hygroscopic solvent before applying the sample to a cell. Preparing solids may involve pushing the sample through a die press to generate a translucent material for this technique or combining the sample with a mulling agent such as Nujol prior to application on potassium bromide salt plates. This technique produces a spectrum with a fingerprint region and characteristic absorbance leads to stretching and bending of bonds in molecules in this technique. It produces a broad peak for alcohols around 3300 inverse centimeters. For 10 points, name this spectroscopic technique using wavelength slightly longer than that of visible light.

answer: {Alzheimer's} disease

Recent results have shown that S100B levels in the serum can indicate progression of this disease, and neuron-specific enolase levels can be used to measure its morphological status. Tacrine can provide temporary relief to sufferers, and long-term effects of this disease are likely caused by the release of beta-secretase. One hypothesis states that it is abnormalities in tau proteins that lead to this disease. Sufferers of this disease experience plaques and tangles in the brain as a result of beta-amyloid accumulation. Suffocation of neurons and defects in proper electrochemical signaling suggest this disease is linked with deficiencies in acetylcholine synthesis. For 10 points, name this disease associated with memory loss in the elderly.
