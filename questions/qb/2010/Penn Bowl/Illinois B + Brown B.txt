The presence of these proteins in apoptotic blebs may be responsible for the development of autoantibodies in Lupus, and variants of them include CenpA and 2AX, the later of which is an indication of repair. In Drosophila the Suppressor of Variegation proteins are partly responsible for modifying these proteins, and the Polycomb and Trithorax proteins have opposing effects on the clustering of these proteins. The PRMN4 pathway also acts on these proteins, and Jenuwen and Allis postulated the idea of a code of them, in which a combinatorial set of modification of them is an indication of gene expression in particular regions. They can be palmitoylated, phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, but more often they are acetylated and methylated in order to form open and closed chromatin, respectively. Present in an octomeric form known as a nucleosome, for 10 points, name these highly positively charged proteins, which are responsible for binding to DNA.

A superstructure that contains several of these is found in peridin pigments, and a bundle of four of these structures form a bromodomain. A structure that contains several of these structures between 50-degree turns  is known as the globin fold. These structures have a double minima at 208 and 222 nm on far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, and Davydov solitons propagate along them.

The Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithm are used to find parameters of a type of model that uses one of these mathematical entities. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a method of sampling that combines a Monte Carlo method with one of these mathematical objects. The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation can be used to find the joint distribution of the entities contained in one of these objects, which when aperiodic and positive recurrent are referred to as ergodic. They are usually defined by a transition matrix and unlike a martingale only rely on the previous state.
