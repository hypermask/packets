At one point in this work, one character fills a bathtub with water upon hearing a noise that is never fully explained. At the end, that protagonist dies and his child goes to live with another family, whose child was first encountered in a somewhat abandoned town. Earlier, those two protagonists went to the ocean, where a drifting boat was raided for supplies, where the protagonist leaves a revolver and is forced to go after it. This protagonist and his son find a home in which slaves are kept for sex, and in another episode the man and his son find an survival shelter and eat tomato sauce out of jars. The protagonist of this novel hears and speaks with the ghost of his wife, who had killed herself earlier rather than continue to live in the world. For ten points, name this work that focuses on the unnamed man and his son traveling along the titular highway in a post-apocalyptic world by Cormac McCarthy.

Inversion of auxiliaries and these objects occurs in T?C-movement and DP-movement involves the raising of these objects from the specifier position of an embedded VP to the TP specifier in a main clause.

Those "dummy" versions are called expletives and include "it" and "there". Icelandic is notable for a group of these constituents called "quirky", which often appear in the dative case, though in many Indo-European languages, these constituents are more often marked by the nominative.

Meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft found a necessary condition for instability of inviscid parallel plane flows that is stronger than this man's inflection point criterion.  This man showed that inviscid Couette flow is unstable if the square of “r squared omega” decreases with radius, a result later extended by the linear stability analysis of G. I. Taylor.  He predicted a type of surface wave that travels slower than Love, S and P waves, and he found a one over wavelength to the fourth power dependence in the intensity resulting from his namesake elastic light scattering process, while another formulation partially named for this Englishman leads to the ultraviolet catastrophe.
