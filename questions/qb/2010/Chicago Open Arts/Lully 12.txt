Heitor Villa-Lobos composed his Ciranda de Sos Notas for it, while Sofia Gubaidulina's concerto for this instrument is usually recorded alongside her Duo Sonata for it, both of which were inspired by her friend Valery Popov. Prokofiev wrote a "humoristic Scherzo" for four of them, and other works for it include Gliere's Humoresque and Impromptu and Weber's (*) Andante e rondo ungarese. Mozart's K.191 is the only surviving concerto of the three he composed for this instrument, which was the beneficiary of 37 concerti by Vivaldi.

answer: {Jules Hardouin}-{Mansart}

One of this man's creations is based on St. Peter's and uses a system of three dome shells, the innermost of which is truncated such that the attic windows in the intermediate shell are not visible though the paintings on the ceiling are. That artifice was likely a technique this man learned from his great uncle Francois, who also created a namesake four-sided curb hip roof. He came to prominence by designing a chateau in Clagney for the Madame de Montespan, and he was commissioned to create a circular place to house a single Martin Desjardin sculpture. Besides the Place des Victoires and the Dome of Les (*) Invalides, this man collaborated with Charles Le Brun on simultaneously creating and decorating both the Chateau Marly and the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. For 10 points, name this man, the chief architect for Louis XIV.

answer: Die {Meistersinger von Nuremberg} or The {Mastersingers} of {Nuremberg}

This work's third act opens with the cellos playing a theme that was earlier the counter-melody to the ballad “Jerum! Jerum.” That ballad was first sung shortly before a bass role sings ‘Den Tag seh' ich erscheinen,” which is a coloratura serenade that parodies bel canto arias. The quintet ‘Selig, wie die Sonne' is presented shortly after one character tells the soprano that he has no desire to play King Mark. One of the bass-baritone roles sings “Wahn! Wahn! Überall Wahn!” when recalling the last night's riot, an even that was followed by the other bass-baritone role, the Nightwatchman, calling out the hour. That riot began when David thought Magdalene was being serenaded by (*) Beckmesser. This work ends when the Morning Dream Song wins Veit Pogner's approbation for the apprentice Walter, who has learned his art from Hans Sachs. For 10 points, name this opera about some German performers, a work of Richard Wagner.

answer: The {Haywain}

The outer wings of this work depict bandits strapping a man to a tree as an emaciated man with a wicker basket on his back approaches a precarious bridge. Like its artist's Vienna Last Judgment, this work's left wing shows paradise, though it also shows angels turning into insects. It is thematically similar to its artist's Tabletop of the Seven Deadly Sins, and its right wing shows an impaled man riding a bull as a blue demon ascends a ladder with mortar for a partially built tower. The two versions are at the Prado and the Escorial, while the central panel shows a couple making out in the bushes next to a sky blue (*) demon playing the flute. For 10 points, name this triptych showing a large crowd clamoring to go to hell on the title conveyance, a work of Hieronymus Bosch.

answer: {Bartok String Quartets}

The composer of these works referred to a “funeral dirge” in the first in A minor, likely prompted by his unrequited love for Stefi Geyer, and he also called the Allegro molto capriccioso movement of the second work “a kind of rondo.” The last opens each movement with a section marked Mesto, and that work's Marcia and Burletta sections may have been inspired by similar sections in the composer's work Contrasts. The fifth has a third movement (*) Scherzo alla bulgarese, while the third is entirely in one movement. The fourth has a second movement called Prestissimo, con sordino, and that work's fourth movement is to be played entirely in pizzicato.

answer: The {Seasons} [accept Le {Deluge} or {Winter} until "{ladder}"]

Paul Desjardins argued the use of grey in one work in this series was designed to evoke a feeling of despair. That painting prompted a work on the same theme by Francis Danby and a more violent version by J.M.W Turner. One work in this series shows a woman climbing a ladder to pick fruit while two men walk by with a large bloom of grapes. They were painted during the artist's seventies for Richelieu's grand-nephew, and the second features two parallel walls of corn outlining an extended frieze of reapers meant to evoke the story of Ruth and Boaz. The most famous is a moonlit scene featuring a snake slithering up a rock at far left while men and women struggle to survive the biblical flood; that painting is often called (*) Le Deluge. For 10 points, name this Nicolas Poussin series, including Winter and Summer.
