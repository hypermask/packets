answer: {William Byrd}

This man's five voice setting of Circumdederunt Me notably alternates between homophony and polyphony to emphasize repeated invocations like "O Domine libera." His friend Alfonso Ferrabosco encouraged his use of "double imitation,” which can be seen in his Domine, Praestolamur and the multi-part Infelix Ego, though he still composed his "Babylon" motets such as Ne Irascaris, Domine in a more homophonic style. His twenty variations on the song "The Leave Be Green" can be found in his Browning, and his collection Songs of Sundrie Natures came only two years after he published thirty-seven of his motets in the (*) Cantiones Sacrae, which differ from the later and more madrigalesque works of the Gradualia. He composed masses in three, four, and five parts in addition to contributing to the Fitzwilliam Virginal Booke alongside John Bull. For 10 points, name this English Renaissance composer, a former collaborator and student of Thomas Tallis.

answer: {Lady} with an {Ermine}

The earliest reference to this work is a sonnet by Bernardo Bellincioni, which tells this work's commissioner to praise the artist for portraying one of his stars. Carlo Amoretti propagated the falsehood that the subject held a mandolin, and X-rays have revealed that there was to be an arch in the background. While owned by the Czartoryski family, someone placed an inscription in the upper left hand corner incorrectly identifying the subject as the artist's "La (*) Feroniere." This painting shows a fine, gauze-like veil with gold threading holding the subject's hair in place, and that subject stands with her face turned to the left though her body takes a three-quarter pose angled to the right. Commissioned by Ludovico il Moro for his mistress Cecilia Gallerani, for 10 points, name this portrait by Leonardo da Vinci of a woman with a certain animal.

answer: {Shostakovich's} Symphony {No.} 10

In this work's Moderato first movement, the clarinet melody is a quotation from the Urlicht (Primal Song) played in the last movement of Mahler's Second Symphony, though it also quotes from its own composer's song “What is in my name” from the Four Pushkin Monologues. The third movement is an Allegretto nocturne that quotes from the satirical scherzo of the composer's first violin concerto in A minor, while the second movement was declared “a portrait of (*) Stalin, roughly speaking” in the composer's autobiography Testimony. The third movement also makes use of a theme inspired by the composer's Azerbaijani lover Elmira, as well as the D-S-C-H theme that was its composer's musical motto. For 10 points, name this work by a Soviet composer, which marked his avoidance of the “curse of the ninth.”

answer: “Point and {Line} to {Plane}”

One section of this work concerns variations of the sentence "Today I am going to the movies" and discusses the nature of one of one of its subjects using a figure of a star cluster of Hercules and a nitrate-forming nodule.

That titular subject "presents the briefest, constant, innermost assertion" and is "the proto-element of painting".

answer: {Prince Igor} or {Knyaz}' {Igor}'

In this work, the chorus laments their home's downfall in 'Oh, it was not a stormy wind that howled.' Two characters sing matching cavatinas, 'The daylight dies' and 'Where art thou, where,' prior to their love duet, though they part when the title character, who is referred to as a 'falcon,' sings 'Nor rest, nor sleep of any kind.' The Mariinsky edition replaced the epilogue chorus 'God heard our prayers' with 'Glory to the multitude of stars,' thus repeating the material that followed the prologue's (*) solar eclipse.
