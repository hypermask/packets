answer: {Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto} in D Major, {Op.} 35

Its second theme features an octatonic scale development that was also used one year earlier in the composer's Fourth Symphony in F minor, and this work was later popularized by Karel Halí?, though Eduard Hanslick claimed this work "stinks to the ears." Its Allegro vivacissimo finale is played attaca after the second movement, which is a G minor Canzonetta, and this work's dedication was originally rejected by (*) Leopold Auer. This work is in D major, much like famous works in the same genre by Beethoven and Brahms. For 10 points, name this work for a solo instrument and string orchestra, composed by a Russian who also wrote the Manfred Symphony and the 1812 Overture.

answer: Claus {Sluter}

Some of this sculptor's lesser known works, such as Fragment of Crucified Christ, are housed in the Musee Acheologique. Another of his works includes a pair of gold-winged angels on one side, across from a gold-maned lion at the foot of the work. John Moffitt described the figures in that work as a "procession of pleurants". Those 41 figures all stand mostly in pairs and have their faces covered by their robes and navigate behind a cloister-like arcade. Another work of his was executed for John the Fearless and contains a crucifixion, or "Calvary" scene, and has a hexagonal base surrounded by six prophets, including the titular one. Successor to Jean de Marville at the Chartreuse de Champmol in (*) Dijon, this is, for 10 points, which Dutch sculptor who worked on Philip the Bold's tomb and the creator of the Well of Moses?

answer: {Lincoln} Cathedral [accept The {Cathedral Church} of the {Blessed Virgin Mary} of {Lincoln}; accept {St. Mary's Cathedral}]

The tierceron vaults associated with one room in this building use two keystones placed outside of the center, thus creating an asymmetrical pattern of two ribs on one side and one on the other, leading Robert Willis to famously dub them "crazy." A stone screen that fills four of the great interior arches characterizes this building's "Rood Tower." It features a ten sided, twenty ribbed chapter house, while elaborately foliaged corbeling appears only in the spandrels of a room noted for its sculptures, the (*) "Angel choir." Fine tracery of the Early English and Decorated periods, respectively, characterizes two rose windows in the transepts known as "Dean's Eye" and Bishop's Eye." Led by men like Remigius, Alexander the Magnificent, and Grosseteste and containing St. Hugh's Choir, for 10 points, name this Gothic English cathedral.

answer: {monkeys} [accept {apes} until {Thomas Rowlandson}]

In Vasari's Lives, it is reported that one of these creatures was taught by a student of Rosso Fiorentino to steal grapes and fruits and destroyed a priest's garden, and Thomas Rowlandson created depictions of their “faces” in a work. David Teniers the Younger depicted a “Guardroom with” these in one work, and it's not a horse, but George Stubbs painted a “Green” one of these. One of these is operated on in James Ensor's The Vile Vivisectors, and they appear in Henri Rousseau's (*) The Merry Jesters. Niccolo Boldrini created a work after Titian's satirizing of the Laocoon Group in which these creatures appear, and one of these appears on a leash in a pointillist work. For 10 points, identify this jungle animal appearing in Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte, as well as in a self-portrait by Frida Kahlo.

answer: First {Symphony} or {Symphony No.} 1

Franz Berwald's composition of this type and number was premiered at the same concert as his operetta I Enter the Monastery and was dubbed "serieuse." A setting of the Te Deum dominates the last three movements of such a work that features a xylophone cadenza; that work is Havergal Brian's "Gothic." Beethoven's opens with a dominant seventh C chord resolving into an F chord and uses a scherzo for the third movement's ostensible minuet. Movements such as "Prophecy" and "Lamentation" characterize (*) Bernstein's three movement venture, while another work of this type and number has a first movement that quotes "Ging heut Morgen" from the Songs of a Wayfarer and a third movement that uses a melody based on “Frere Jacques”. For 10 points, give the type and number of those compositions, examples of which include Mahler's Titan.

answer: “{Dream} a {Little Dream} of {Me}”

The singer of this song says that she “linger[s] on dear, still craving your kiss”. Zooey Deschanel's performance of this song at a fashion show by Erin Fetherston sees her reach her highest pitch on the word “Stars” in the first line. This song imagines “Night breezes” that “seem to whisper ‘I love you'” and “Birds singin' in the (*) sycamore tree”. It was written by Fabian Andre and Wilbur Schwandt, and this song asks for the title action to occur “when you're alone”. For 10 points, identify this song that Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong performed in a duet, and perhaps most notably sung by Mama Cass and the Mamas and the Papas.

This man oppposed the use of historicism in discussing fashion in his "The Logic of Vanity Fair." He argued "image makers" choose materials based on a psychological need in his "Meditations on a Hobbyhorse," while one of this man's essays, collected in Ideals and Idols, considers "Hegelianism without metaphysics" in the work of Lamprecht and Riegl and ultimately rejects how Huizinga and Burckhardt have formulated the title discpline. This author of (*) "In Search of Cultural History" rejected Ruskin's "innocent eye" in a work that draws on his friend Karl Popper to posit that a willing sense of disbelief is part of the "beholder's share" in viewing a painting.

answer: {Les Pecheurs} de {Perles} or The {Pearl Fishers}

The third act begins with an intermezzo followed by this work's troubled baritone role singing “L'orage s'est calme.” One character tells her lover to kill her in “Pour moi je ne crains,” which precedes a jealous back and forth that culminates in the duet “Eh bien, va.” At the beginning of Act 3, Scene 2, the mob sings the dawn chorus “Des que le soleil,” and that scene sees the central couple sing their last duet “Plus de crainte.” That central couple was freed thanks to the machinations of the baritone, who claimed the huts were on fire before showing a necklace he had earlier snatched. The gods are addressed by (*) Nourabad in this work, which twice features the chorus “Brahma, divin Brahma.” This opera sees both the baritone and tenor roles sing “Au fond du temple saint,” which reveals that both Zurga and Nadir are in love with Leila. Taking place amongst the title people in Ceylon, for 10 points, name this Bizet opera.

answer: The Battle of the {Centaurs} [accept equivalents like The {Battle} of the {Centaurs} and the {Lapiths}]

The earliest record of this work is found in a letter by Giovanni Borromeo, which refers to "twenty-five heads and twenty different bodies." This work was apparently the first for which its artist did not use a bow drill, and a twisting figure on the bottom left hand corner cowers and ducks away, while a figure on the bottom right raises his arm above a figure who ducks away. Condivi described this work as "the abduction of Deianeira" and it was its artist's last work created while under patronage of (*) Lorenzo de' Medici. Inspired by a similar relief produced by Bertoldo di Giovanni, The Equestrian Battle in the Ancient Manner, and depicting a battle between Lapiths and the titular group, this is, for 10 points, which relief by Michelangelo?

One figure in this painting is said to have been modeled after one in Bernini's Pulcino della Minerva. On the right side of the work, a cut-off mass of earthy rock appears, and one of the central objects casts a shadow on the ground. Its titular creature is barely visible near that object, a larger version of which appears on the far left of the painting. Droplets of water appear in the air, and a rifle is pointed at a figure with visibly wet hair, a woman who the painter identified as being (*) Gala. The influence of Freud is seen in this painting, which also features a huge red fish attempting to devour a pair of big cats.

answer: {Mendelssohn's String Octet} in E-flat major, Opus 20

This work's composer claimed this work is to “be played by all instruments in symphonic orchestral fashion.” It is frequently recorded alongside Max Bruch's B-flat major work for the same ensemble, and it opens with an Allegro moderato ma con fuoco movement. This work's Scherzo is marked Allegro leggierissimo and is to be played Sempre pianissimo e staccato; that Scherzo was also inspired by the lines beginning “Flights of clouds and gaudy mists” from the “Walpurgis Nacht” of (*) Goethe's Faust. Written when its composer was 16, this Opus 20 work in E-flat major was shortly followed by its composer's Opus 21 Overture for A Midsummer Night's Dream.
