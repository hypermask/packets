answer: {Apollo Belvedere} [accept {Apollo} of the {Belvedere} or {Pythian Apollo}]

The poem "Antiquarie Prospetiche Romane" claims this work was held by a Genoese cardinal at SS. Apostoli, while various codices attest it was found in the garden of San Pietro in Vincoli. Thomas Crawford's sculpture of Cerberus borrowed the pose of the sculptures of two Molossian dogs that sit next to this work. Giovanni Montorsoli restored part of the right arm and the left hand, and Antonio Canova created his Perseus with the Head of Medusa to replace it after Napoleon took it in 1796. It is contained in a namesake (*) courtyard designed by Bramante in the Vatican Palace, and shows the subject nude but for the cloak on his back the moment after he has fired his arrow. For 10 points, name this copy of a Leochares sculpture depicting its figure after he kills the Python.

answer: The {Bartered Bride}

Two characters in this work sing the duettino “We'll make a nice little animal of you” upon finding a replacement for their dancing bear, who is currently too drunk. This work features a duet marked Andante amoroso beginning “I know a girl who burns for you” which follows a young tenor stuttering about his mother. A song beginning “That dream of love” was added to the only aria with a libretto in iambs rather than trochees, “Oh, what pain.” Minor characters in this opera include the Circus Master and the “Indian” dancer Esmeralda, and in this work Krušina is informed that the elder of (*) Micha's two sons is a vagabond. Yet despite Kecal's best attempts, Micha is unable to get his son Vašek to marry Marenka, who greatly prefers Jenik. For 10 points, name this opera by Bedrich Smetana about Czech marriage negotiations.

answer: {Henry Fuseli}

In one of his writings, he defined beauty as a "despotic princess", subject to the "anarchies" of despotism in a section on "Ancient Art". He depicted a male figure with wings flying away from the first woman laying nude on the ground in The Dream of Eve, and he also depicted himself "In Conversation" with Johann Bodmer. This author of Lectures on Painting also executed a portrait of the woman whose heart he broke, Mary Wollstonecraft. A muscular figure at the edge of a boat raises an axe in front of a blue monster in his (*) Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent. He remains best-known for depicting the dark image of a horse emerging from red curtains, and a ghastly figure approaching a sleeping woman. For 10 points, identify this painter of The Nightmare.

answer: {Lascaux Caves}

This place is the namesake of a virtual reality art installation created by Benjamin Britton, and a namesake charcoal discoered here is indicative of the fact that climate has progressively warmed up in the area. A “Crossed” depiction of one subject appears in one of its most prominent portions, and only one depiction of a human seems to exist, and that one is dead. Marcel Ravidat and Jacques Marsal are among those who discovered this site. This place includes an “Accident Scene”, in which the status of whether or not a (*) bison is injured has been a cause for discussion among analysts. Including the Shaft of the Dead Man and The Great Hall of the Bulls, for 10 points, identify this site near Montignac, containing depictions of Upper-Paleolithic art.

answer: The {Dying Swan}

Maya Plisetskeya played the title figure of this ballet at the age of 70. This work sees a ballerina move her arms in semicircles, and it was inspired by a poem beginning “The plain was grassy, wild and bare” by Tennyson. Famous for its use of (*) pas de bourée, or tiny steps, it sees the central ballerina conduct her arms in a wavy fashion before kneeling on her left foot at the end. The most famous performer of this ballet performed it nearly 4,000 times, and her deathbed saw her ask to play the “last measure” of it softly. For 10 points, identify this ballet by Michel Folkine that was most famously performed by Anna Pavlova, based on the only portion of the Carnival of the Animals that Saint-Saens allowed to be played in his lifetime.

answer: {Schubert Piano Sonatas} [prompt on partial ANSWER]

One of these works features a hemiola and a minuet in A minor that copied melodies of Mozart, while the eleventh one ends with three major triads, and had its Adagio section removed by the composer. A sketch for one in C is known as the “Oubliée.” No. 14 in A minor uses the same rhythm as the composer's song An den Mond, in einer Herbstnacht and No. 13 is known as the “little” one in A major. What remains of the third movement of one of them quickly modulates from A flat to A major; that one was once called “Reliquie.” No. 17 in D major may quote the composer's song Das Heimweh and is known as “Gasteiner.” A four bar theme titled un poco più lento begins and ends the last movement rondo of the “Fantasy” one, and the second one is called (*) “Unfinished”. Also including No. 16 in A minor, for 10 points, identify these compositions for a solo instrument by the composer of the Trout Quintet.

answer: {Hugo van der Goes}

The left wing of Dieric Bouts' St. Hippolytus Triptych is almost certainly by this man. One of this man's paintings is set in the Garden of Eden and depicts a female head with hair braided into horns on the body of a large salamander. Emil Wauters depicted the madness that came upon this painter of the aforementioned Fall of Man after he finished one of his last works. In addition to The Death of the Virgin and the earlier Monforte Altarpiece, one of his works was intended for the altar at Sant'Egidio and depicts a sheaf of corn behind lilies and seven columbines as well as a stable in which an ox can be seen below the faint outline of a demon opening its maw. That work shows angels and donors kneeling before an infant Christ on the (*) ground emitting golden aureoles. For 10 points, name this painter of the Portinari Altarpiece.

The waiter Carl drives this character to a hotel, so that a character whom she last met at “La Belle Aurore” can enter a meeting. She tells one character that “You used to be a much better liar”, and is married to Victor (*) Laszlo. At the end of the film that she appears in, she is implored to get on a plane because she'll regret it, “soon, and for the rest of her life”, and before that, she asks Sam to play "As Time Goes By" again.

answer: {Diabelli Variations}

A rising sempre legato figure appears in the eighth of these works marked dolce e teneramente, while the ninth, Allegro pesante e risoluto, is in C minor and is the second piece in this collection to be in 4/4. The first half of the fifteenth, Presto Scherzando, closes on the tonic, and the unison octaves in the 22nd is a reference to Leporello's aria "Notte e giorno faticar." The twenty-sixth is Piacevole, while the twenty-fourth is marked una corda, sempre legato and is a Fughetta Andante. This group of works is analyzed in the chapter "The Shape of a Journey" in a Maynard Solomon book, and they begin with a piece called (*) Alla marcia maestoso. A likely apocryphal story is that this collection's composer first dismissed the central theme as a "cobbler's patch" and refused to take part in the Vaterländischer Künstlerverein project. For 10 points, name this set of thirty-three works for piano, the Opus 120 of Ludwig van Beethoven.
