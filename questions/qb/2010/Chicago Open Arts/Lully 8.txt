answer: {French} Suites

Hans Bischoff considered one manuscript of this collection, known as "Anonymous 5," to be an autograph. It was the second set of works that Heinrich Nicholas Gerber studied while working with their composer, and their moniker is traced to Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg and Johann Nikolaus Forkel, the latter of whom possessed a manuscript labeling the Loure as "Bourree 2" in the fifth piece. Their composer replaced a Gavotte with an Anglaise in the third in B minor and the sixth is the only one with a polonaise. Each begins with an allemande, courante, and sarabande, and they don't begin with preludes, unlike a similar collection. For 10 points, name this collection of the works BWV 812-817, a set of (*) suites by Johann Sebastian Bach.
