This painting depicts a man yanking on a white horse's rein in the bottom left, while the center features a large couch whose corners are golden (*) elephant heads. Upon that bed is the relaxed title figure and two fallen concubines as soldiers invade, an embellished version of a scene from a Byron work.

answer: {Frank Stella}

This man's recent efforts include some 300-odd sculptures meant to match the Essercizi of Scarlatti.

His Norton lectures were called Working Space, and his study of parallel lines dominated his aluminum works, such as the Polish Village series, while the Eccentric Polygon series exemplified his use of shaped canvases. He would later move on to the rainbow colored arabesques of the Exotic Bird series after the extreme starkness of his (*) Black Paintings.

answer: {BACH} motif [accept "{B}-{flat/A/C/B}" until mentioned; accept {clear knowledge} equivalents]

Luigi Dallapiccola's Quaderno Musicale di Annalibera uses it in the "Simbolo" opening, possibly in reference to Schoenberg's use of it in the Variations for Orchestra. Max Reger wrote a "Fantastia and fugue" on it, and it is the unifying idea behind Alfred Schnittke's Quasi una sonata. By combining it with its inverse and its transposition up by a minor sixth, Alfred Webern was able to construct the tone row for his String Quartet. Robert Schumann wrote six fugues on it, and Franz Lizst composed a fantasy and fugue for organ on this theme. It is also the third subject of the last Contrapunctus in The Art of Fugue.

The novels Manette Salomon and Germinie Lacerteux by the Goncourt brothers are the two yellow books on the table in one version of this painting. This work's artist described the subject's clothes as “ultramarine” because it “brings out the face and makes it paler” and the artist also claimed it contained the “heartbroken expression of our time.” Likely based on Delacroix's Tasso in Prison, the version of this work in the Musee d'Orsay shows the subject with a face of sunburned hue and holding purple (*) foxgloves in his hand. The artist commented on how its subject's melancholy expression “might well seem like a grimace,” and both versions of this work show the subject resting his head on his right arm. For 10 points, name this 1890 work potrait created at Auvers-sur-Oise, a depiction of a physician by Vincent van Gogh.
