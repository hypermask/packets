answer: “A {Valediction}: {Forbidding Mourning}”

The speaker of this work asks its addressee to “endure not yet / A breach, but an expansion, / Like gold to aery thinness beat” after earlier expressing a desire to “melt, and make no noise.” This poem's speaker criticizes those “whose soul is sense” and who engage in “dull sublunary lovers' love,” arguing that while “Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears,” the “trepidation of the spheres” is innocent. Its addressee's soul is compared to “the fix'd foot” around which the speaker must “obliquely run,” and its speaker notes that “thy firmness makes my circle just / And makes me end where I begun.” For 10 points, identify this poem that depicts a pair of lovers using the metaphysical conceit of a compass, a work of John Donne that urges no grieving upon parting.

answer: {mitochondria} [or {mitochondrion}]

In Drosophila, the fuzzy onions gene regulates the fusion of these organelles in sperm, which creates the nebenkern. One disease that affects these organelles results in a “salt-and-pepper” pigmentation of the retina. In another disease, these organelles take the appearance of “ragged red fibers” under a Gomori trichrome stain. In addition to the aforementioned Kearns-Sayre syndrome, the TIM/TOM complex sees the translocation of proteins into them. Enzymatic abnormalities in these organelles can result in significant oxidative stress, and cytochrome C is found within these structures. It contains inner compartments called cristae. For 10 points, name these organelles with namesake matrilineal DNA, known as the “powerhouse” of the cell.

Critics argued that this thinker treated organizations such as the UN and WTO as voluntary organizations, and not ones that are organized internally, in his last major work. He discussed the extent to which liberal democracies can deal with political arguments based on moral doctrines in "The Idea of Public Reason Revisited" and Political Liberalism. This author of The Law of Peoples wrote that social system should not "encourage propensities and aspirations it is bound to repress and disappoint," in his magnum opus, which suggests that liberalist and socialist egalitarian outlooks can coexist and introduces the “difference principle.” Criticized by Michael Sandel and Robert Nozick, this is, for 10 points, which author who discussed the “veil of ignorance” in his A Theory of Justice?

Seas of calcite predominate during times of low concentration of this element. The NIMS probe discovered that Ganymede has a sulfate of this element, which is also used to treat eclampsia. Its molten form is used to make metallic titanium in the Kroll process. The active site of rubisco contains a carbamylated lysine attached to an ion of this element. Its cationic form is used to stabilize the product of PCR, and it is also prevalent in certain reagents in a Schlenck equilibrium. It is found in Grignard reagents as well as coordinated to the porphyrin ring of chlorophyll. For 10 points, name this element with atomic number 12 and symbol Mg.

answer: index of {refraction} [prompt on {n}]

One paradox concerning this quantity, in which one calculation places it in the numerator but a formula for an identical quantity places it in the denominator, was raised by Peierls. A complex version of this quantity adds i plus the extinction coefficient, while one formula sets its square equal to a rational equation in terms of the coefficients B1 through 3 and C1 through 3. This quantity can be negative in artificial metamaterials. The arctangent of the ratio of this quantity for two materials gives Brewster's angle. Along with the sines of the angle of incidence and this quantity's namesake angle, it is used in Snell's Law. For 10 points, name this quantity that describes the speed of light in a medium, the namesake of a certain light-bending effect.

A specific type of these entities x obey a relation in which x squared divides the x minus Legendre symbol x over fifth Fibonacci number. Another type satisfies the conditions of Wolstonholme's theorem for the fourth power, though all of them satisfy that result for the third power. If x is one of these and 2x plus 1 is also, they are named for Germain. In addition to the Wall-Sun-Sun ones, these numbers divide themselves minus one factorial plus one according to Wilson's theorem. Their count is asymptotic to x over the natural log of x, and Goldberg's hypothesis states that every even number can be expressed as the sum of two of these. Fermat and Mersenne give their names to varieties of, for 10 points, what kind of number whose only factors are one and itself?

Later thinkers built on this work's assertion that a concept is “something universal which serves as a rule.” A notable commentary on this work was written by the author of Philosophy of As If, Hans Vaihinger. This work describes how one gains experience from creating a unity out of a manifold, and it presents time and space as the two pure forms of intuition. Of quantity, of quality, of relation, and of modality are the divisions into which this work places the twelve categories of understanding. It attempts to establish the necessity of certain propositions through the transcendental ideas. This work rejects the possibility of metaphysics, though it does show how other synthetic a priori propositions are possible. For 10 points, name this Immanuel Kant work, the first of his critiques.
