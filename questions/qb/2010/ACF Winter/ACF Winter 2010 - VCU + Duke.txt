Herbert Kelman identified three major causes of this phenomenon. Most psychologists divide it into informational and normative types. One experiment that demonstrated this involved a darkened room in which participants were asked to estimate the distance a dot of light moved. In addition to that “autokinetic effect” experiment by Muzafer Sherif, another experiment that examined this phenomenon was repeated by Perrin and Spencer and distinguished between “true partners” and “compromise partners.” That experiment concerning this phenomenon was performed on groups of eight people in which all but one were confederates.

answer: {ketones}

Dehydrating this compound forms an oxazole in the Robinson-Gabriel synthesis, and zinc compounds are used to generate them from thioesters in the Fukuyama coupling. Another reaction used to generate them uses thorium oxide to cyclize a dicarboxylic acid. Another method to create them uses a Lewis acid to create an acyl cloride, which undergoes an electrophilic aromatic substitution. In addition to the Ruzicka cyclization and the Friedel-Crafts reaction, these compounds can be created from secondary alcohols using the Jones reagent. They exist in an equilibrium with enols in a simple form of tautomerism. For 10 points, name these carbonyls that contain a carbon double bonded to an oxygen bound to two R groups.

answer: {RSA} encryption [or {Rivest}, {Shamir} and {Adleman}]

This algorithm is often paired with OAEP, which makes it probabilistic by adding random oracles. Now implemented via the PCKS scheme, modern versions use the Carmichael function. One pair of values generated have a product congruent to 1 modulo lambda of n. One step involves computing the totient of the product of two numbers and finding an integer that is coprime to that result. Another step in this algorithm is to find the modular multiplicative inverse of e, and the efficacy of this algorithm is proven by Fermat's Little Theorem. Its secure because of the difficulty in factoring large primes. For 10 points, name this public key encryption algorithm pioneered at MIT by the three scientists whose initials give it its name.

answer: {capacitance}

A quantum version of this quantity for 2D-electron systems is equal to the fundamental charge squared times the density of states; graphene's band structure gives it two values of this quantity. Changes in this quantity are measured in deep level transient spectroscopy. It can be increased using an inverting voltage amplifier by 1 minus A sub v, an effect exploited in pole splitting named for Miller. Its inverse is known as elastance, and for an isolated sphere its equal to four pi epsilon a. In another configuration, it is equal to epsilon times epsilon sub naught times A over d. The SI unit for this quantity is measured in coulombs per volts and is called the farad. For 10 points, name this measure of the amount of electric charge stored in a namesake electronic component.
