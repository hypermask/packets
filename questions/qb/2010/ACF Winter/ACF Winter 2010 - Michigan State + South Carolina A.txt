answer: {optical illusions}

One variety of these entities was elucidated by R. L. Gregory and P. Heard, who expanded on Hugo Munsterberg's work with his namesake type of these, and Pierce attributed the effects of one to a “boring in” theory later expounded on by Fraser, who compared these to the “twisted cord,” or Zollner types. An apparent angular distortion model was developed by Wagner, who described the effects of the canonical Jastrow and Poggendorf types, one of which features two adjacent arcs and the other which features a line drawn through a rectangle. Including examples like the Necker cube and Wittgenstein's duckrabbit, these are, for 10 points, what visual images which either distort a viewer's perception of them or offer multiple possibilities for their visual perception?

answer: {piezoelectricity}

Along with dielectric constant, this property is diminished in the pyrochlore phase of a material. Tiersten developed a system of energy balances as an IEEE model for their activity. This behavior can be explained by coupling the equation setting displacement equal to permittivity times electric field with Hooke's law, then looking at the tensor elements. Materials with a center of symmetry cannot undergo this effect, which can be explained by noting that a change in the dipole configuration or density in a bulk material is accompanied by a change in the surface charge. For 10 points, name this property discovered in Rochelle salts by Pierre and Jacques Curie, found in materials like quartz in which an electric response results from stress or strain on a material.

This author of a letter entitled “The Prayer of Twenty Millions” supported Nathaniel Banks's election as Speaker of the House, leading to this man's caning by Albert Rust. He was succeeded in his best known position by Whitelaw Reid. During the Civil War this man urged the slogan “forward on Richmond!” and he lost popularity after signing the bail bond of Jefferson Davis. This onetime ally of Thurlow Weed and William Seward joined with Carl Schurz and Charles Sumner to create an organization that pushed for civil service reform, the Liberal Republican Party. He was unsuccessful in his bid to defeat Ulysses S. Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election and died soon thereafter. For 10 points, name this founder and longtime editor of the glyph817ew York Tribune who once urged “go west, young man.”

answer: George Edward {Moore}

This man attacked F.H. Bradley's Principles of Logic in “The Nature of Judgment.” One work by this author argues that there is no reason to believe there can't be physical facts independent of mental facts, and that work asserts the absolute truth of a list of propositions including “there exists at present a human body, which is my body.” Another of his works shows that “blue” cannot be the same as “the sensation of blue” in order to argue against the idea that esse is percipi. In addition to “A Defense of Common Sense” and “The Refutation of Idealism,” he wrote a work that uses the open-question argument to show that there cannot be a meaningful definition of the concept of “good,” a result known as the “naturalistic fallacy.” For 10 points, name this British analytic author of Principia Ethica.

answer: the Earth's {oceans}

Daniel G. Wright pioneered the use of the Tumlirz equation of state for modeling the in situ density of these bodies. The ideal irregular surfaces of these bodies are compared to the reference ellipsoid by taking the angle between the plumb line and the ellipsoidal normal, which results in the “deflection of the vertical.” The geoid is an equipotential surface that coincides with their mean surface level. The Coriolis Effect causes the wind to deflect the movement of the surface of these entities rightward. Near their edges, wind-driven cooler material surfaces in a process called upwelling. These bodies are also home to Ekman spirals and lie atop tectonic plates made of basalt, not granite. For 10 points, name these bodies that include the Arctic, Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific.

answer: {Mahler's} Symphony {glyph817o.} 1 in {D}-{Major,“Titan}” [do not accept the first underlined part after “{Gustav}”]

This symphony features an oboe melody set against a round in its fourth movement, which is cited in Adorno's Physiognomik as the first example of its composer's namesake counterpoint. The “Landler” country dance is the basis for this work's second movement, which opens with a cuckoo's song played as an interval of a fourth as opposed to the usual interval of a third. Its composer described its finale as “the cry of a wounded heart” and requested that its seven horns stand up at its end, while its Blumine movement is often omitted. Its third movement, a funeral march, is based on the themes from “Frere Jacques.” Parts of the first and third movements draw from its composer's Songs of a Wayfarer. For 10 points, which D-major musical work, the first by Gustav Mahler?

answer: {RNA interference} [accept {innate immunity} before mention]

The Drosophila X virus is thought to trigger this pathway as a means of innate immunity. This pathway is responsible for guiding H3K9 methylation in the centromeric regions of S. Cerevisiae. Disruption of P-bodies leads to blunting of this pathway, which was elucidated by the discovery of the lin-4 gene. The Flavr Savr tomato takes advantage of this pathway, which relies on exportin-5 to transport the products of Drosha cleavage to the cytoplasm. Argonaute selects the guide strand to load into the RISC complex, which then can target complementary mRNAs for degredation in this pathway. Craig Mello and Andrew Fire won the Nobel Prize for elucidating this pathway. For 10 points, name this mechanism which uses anti-sense RNA to silence a gene.

The KAN was one organization founded by leaders of this movement, as were K-231 and a revival of Junák, a scouting organization. A meeting discussing this movement was held at Cierná-nad-Tisou. The end of this movement was protested by Jan Palach with self-immolation. Oldrich Cernik and Ota Šik were leaders of it, and Ludvík Vaculík wrote a manifesto supporting it, the “Two Thousand Words.” The aims of this movement were largely carried out by the Action Program. It was followed by a period of “normalization” under Gustav Husák. The policy of “socialism with a human face” was championed during this period by Alexander Dubcek, but it was soon ended by a Soviet crackdown.
