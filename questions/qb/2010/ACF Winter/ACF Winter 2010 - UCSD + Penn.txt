answer: {Cretaceous} period

The Dakota sandstone Pierre Shale are two formations dating from this period, during which the Tethys Ocean became a shallow sea. Chalk deposits left by the Western Interior Seaway during this period formed the Smoky Hills Chalk in America, and the Dover Cliffs chalk in Europe was also formed at the same time. This period closed with the eruption of the Deccan Traps in India, which may be related to an impact that resulted in a thin layer of iridium forming between this period and the one that follows it. The Alvarezes posited that the KT boundary marks the stratigraphic border between this period and the Tertiary. For 10 points, name this period in which the T. Rex lived, the last period of the Mesozoic era that probably ended with a big meteor impact at Chixtulub.

answer: {trumpet}

Vincent Persichetti's Parables XIV and XXV were written for this instrument, which has a secondary solo role in Shostakovich's First Piano Concerto. Three of them are employed at the opening of Ashkenazy's orchestration of Pictures at an Exhibition, as opposed to the one usually used. Joseph Hummel wrote a concerto for this instrument for Anton Weidinger, for whom another pioneering work for this instrument was written to utilize a "keyed" version to access low-register chromatic notes not on the overtone scale. It is featured in a notable Concerto in E-flat by Joseph Haydn. The titular five-note query in Charles Ives' The Unanswered Question is played by this instrument. For 10 points, name this valved brass instrument, whose jazz virtuosi include Louis Armstrong.

answer: {rationality} [accept {rational expectations} since that is {what} is {specifically referred} to early on]

In political science, the first chapter of Essence of Decision explores this idea in the context of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Gary Becker notably applied this concept to the analysis of addiction and crime. The sequential form of this idea determines optimal strategies in a perfect Bayesian equilibrium. Herbert Simon's notion of satisficing relies on the “bounded” form of this idea, since humans are rarely mentally able to carry out complex calculations. Utility maximization is assumed in most game theoretic situations due to perfectly exhibition of this idea. Behavior of this type is built into many macroeconomic models and is called these type of “expectations.” For 10 points, name this assumption suggesting that people optimally use all available information when making decisions.

answer: {ribozymes} [prompt on {Rglyph1197A} before mentioned]

One example of these molecules regulates the production of GlmS based on glucosamine-6-phosphate presence in the cell. Another of these molecules has an activity-essential motif consisting of G5, G8, and G12, as well as a U- turn that gives it its namesake shape. Examples of these molecules capable of catalyzing in vivo Diels-Alder reactions were described by Seelig. Another type of them might allow for production of HIV-resistant T-cells. They provide evidence for Gilbert's RNA world hypothesis, and these molecules are capable of hydrolyzing their own phosphodiester bonds. For 10 points, give this term for RNA molecules with enzyme-like catalytic activity, such as the “Hammerhead” type.

answer: {Hamiltonian}

The Thiemann operator is a candidate for this type of constraint, which would describe kinematics in quantum loop theory. Vector fields described by this adjective are obtained by rotating the gradient field components ninety degrees, and are important for determining equations of motion in phase space. Ehrenfest's theorem relates the time derivative of an observable with the commutator of this operator with that observable's operator. Cycles of this type touch every vertex of a graph once before returning to the starting vertex. When applied to wavefunctions, the operator of this type yields energy eigenvalues. For 10 points, give this term describing an operator that equals the sum of kinetic and potential energy, named for an Irish mathematician and represented by a capital H.

answer: The {Anatomy Lesson} of {Dr.} Nicholas {Tulp} [or De {Anatomische Les} van {Dr.} Nicolaes {Tulp}]

Vincent van Gogh complimented the tones of “bare earth” found in the feet of one person depicted in this work. The asymmetrical groupings of figures in this painting were inspired by the artist's desire not to replicate a similar work by Thomas de Keyzer. One figure's shoulder casts a shadow that forms a mask over the central figure's eyes. Another figure in this work holds a list in his left hand and stands in front of a scroll displaying the artist's name. The lower right foreground of this work depicts a huge open book, likely a work of Vesalius. In this painting, seven figures with ruffed collars observe the forearm muscles of the criminal Aris Kindt being held up with a forceps.
