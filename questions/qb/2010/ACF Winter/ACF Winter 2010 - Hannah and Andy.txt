answer: inflation

The Tobin effect shows how this phenomenon encourages investors to place their money in real capital projects. Its “built-in” form comes from adaptive expectations and is part of Gordon's “triangle model.” Tobin and Mundell showed that real economic effects can occur from expectation of this phenomenon, which can lead to inefficiencies from shoe-leather and menu costs. The existence of this phenomenon prevents a “liquidity trap.” The Fisher hypothesis argues that the real interest rate is independent of this phenomenon, which is measured by changes in the GDP deflator or CPI. For 10 points, name this phenomenon, coming in “cost-push” and “demand-pull” varieties, which causes the consumer price index to rise as money becomes devalued.

Zephyrus jealously blew a discus thrown by this god into the head of his lover Hyacinthus, killing the latter. This god was forced to serve as Admetus's shepherd after avenging the death of his son Asclepius. His rejection by Cassandra led him to curse that prophetess never to be believed. This god surrendered his stolen cows to Hermes in exchange for the lyre, and he and his twin sister killed the fourteen children of Niobe.

answer: {electric} field [or {E} field]

Particles of dielectric materials may be separated in a fractionation method that uses a nonuniform one of these. Band-bending occurs because it varies linearly in a depletion layer. Symmetric top molecules undergo line-splitting in their microwave spectrum due to the application of one of these. Modulators for active Q-switching lasers rely on an effect in which crystals lacking inversion symmetry become birefringent in linear proportion to the magnitude of one of these. Its flux through a surface is proportional to enclosed charge, and its curl is equal to the negative time partial of the magnetic field. Its magnitude is proportional to one-over-r for a line charge, and it is proportional to one over r squared for a point charge. For 10 points, name this vector field given in units of volts per meter.

answer: {amines}

Drug discovery research employs a synthesis that produces alpha-phosphonate examples of this functionality from a carbonyl, a hydrophosphoryl compound, and a primary one of these. A test for this functionality, which can discern between their degrees of substitution, employs aqueous sodium hydroxide and benzenesulfonyl chloride and is named for Hinsburg. CO2 is released upon the addition of hydrazoic acid through an isocyanate intermediate in one reaction to form them. PPh3 is used to reduce azides to this functionality in the Staudinger ligation. The best known synthesis of these compounds reacts primary alkyl halides with potassium phthalimide, and is named for Gabriel. For 10 points, name this functionality whose members possess a nitrogen with three single bonds to substituents.

A philosopher who wrote about this school "of the Social World" applied it to William James's concept of “Stream of Consciousness.” This school was applied to empathy by Max Scheler, a member of the Munich Circle devoted to it. One work in this field rejects the strict dichotomy between “being-in-itself” and “being-for-itself” in the interaction with the other, and that work presents a “third dialectic.” The founder of this discipline used the methods of the epoché and bracketing and proposed a principle of intentionality in works like The Crisis of European Sciences. This field owes much to Franz Brentano, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty applied it to perception. For 10 points, name this field developed in the Cartesian Meditations and Logical Investigations of Edmund Husserl.

This composer wrote a symphonic suite in which the fairy Gul-Nazar rescues a gazelle from a bird. One of his works uses the unusual time signatures 2/1 and 3/1 in its final movement, and its Andante lugubre first movement alternates a woodwind theme with a cello rendition of the hymn "An Angel Cried Out." The fourth movement of one work by this composer opens with five cadenzas played over percussion rolls and sees violins, violas, and cellos played quasi guitara. That work's third movement nearly repeats its first save in key and instrumentation, an asturian dance.

answer: {pulsars} [prompt on {neutron stars}]

The line-of-sight integral of electron column density to one of these objects is their "dispersion measure," and so- called "timing experiments" done with these objects are employed to detect the Gravitational Wave Background. One of these objects was the first known star save the Sun to possess planets. Turbulence in the interstellar medium is commonly probed using the radiation from these objects. One class of these objects is thought to originate from two mechanisms, one of which is the "spin-up" of low-mass X-ray binaries, the "millisecond" variety. Another class of them rotates due to the decay of a powerful B-field. Starquakes are thought to cause glitches in the periods of these objects. For 10 points, name this class of neutron stars that emits electromagnetic radiation.

answer: insulin

The family that contains this protein also contains a protein suspected to soften the pubis symphysis, which peaks during the first trimester of pregnancy and at delivery. Regulatory sequences of the gene that codes for this protein include MafA and the CAAT enhancer binding element, and NeuroD1 regulates its synthesis. The release of this hormone occurs in a three- to six-minute rhythm, and HGH induces the liver to secrete one of a family of growth factors with sequence similarity to it. This hormone is released following IP3 binding to the ER, triggering calcium release. For 10 points, name this hormone, secreted by the beta cells in the pancreas, which induces tissues to take up glucose and is administered to sufferers of diabetes.
