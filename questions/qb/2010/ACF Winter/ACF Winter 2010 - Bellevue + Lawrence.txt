answer: {Titanium} [or Ti before read]

Performing "electro-deoxidation" on an oxide of this metal may be able to improve on the current method of producing it and is called the Fray-Farthing-Chen Process. Along with a heavier element, extremely pure varieties of this element can be produced in the crystal bar process. When this element is combined with two oxygen molecules it yields a compound that produces the asterism in star sapphires, rutile. One method for producing the metallic form of this element yields a "sponge" form of it and replaced the Hunter Process; the creator of that method also devised a way to produce the chemically similar element, Zirconium. This transition metal is extracted in the Kroll process. For 10 points, name this strong, lightweight element with atomic number 22 and symbol Ti.

Rodriguez-Rivera et al created one algorithm for doing this for Geodesic's Great Circle which is both non-moving and reduces fragmentation. Another method for doing this portions off half of the target at any one time and is known as Cheney's Algorithm. The generational type of this process relies on the infant mortality principle to focus on recently created objects. Incremental forms of this process have fewer performance repercussions than stop-the- world techniques, and several implementations use reference counting. A feature of managed languages, they help prevent bugs related to dangling pointers and can be implemented with a mark-and-sweep algorithm. For 10 points, name this process in computer science in which data no longer being used is reclaimed in memory.

answer: {Bose}-{Einstein condensates} [or {BECs}]

The transition temperature of these systems is proportional to the particle density divided by the Riemann zeta function, all to the two-thirds power. Vortices in them are allowed via the psi-squared term in the equation describing the wavefunction of these systems. Sweeping a magnetic field through one of these causes spin-flip collisions and the Feschbach resonance, while further increasing the field causes an implosion followed by an explosion in a namesake type of nova. Their wavefunction is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. They were first created by Cornell, Wieman, and Ketterle by laser-cooling a bunch of rubidium atoms. For 10 points, name this system consisting of a bunch of degenerate ultracold bosons.
