answer: {Deucalion}

In one story, this mythological figure is the grandfather of Delphos, founder of Delphi, through the liaison between Apollo and this figure's daughter Thyia. According to the Catalogue of Women, another grandson of this figure is the Cretan runner Orsilochus, whose father had to promise Poseidon to sacrifice the first thing he saw upon returning from the Trojan War, forcing the son of this figure to sacrifice one of his children. The event with which this father of Idomeneus is most associated came about partly due to Lycaon's sacrifice of his own son to Zeus, an event after which this man's vessel came to rest on Mt. Parnassus. This man repopulated the earth by throwing stones over his shoulder with his wife, Pyrrha. For 10 points, name this Greek survivor of Zeus's flood.

answer: deserts

The “Hamada” types of these areas are rockier than other types. One type of landform found in these areas contains a “slip face” and a trough between peaks known as the “slack.” The Köppen classification breaks these types of areas down into BWh and BWk types. Clay and iron oxide stick to unexposed rocks in these areas, producing their namesake “varnish.” Closely packed rock fragments up to cobble size can form Gibber plains in these regions, also known as their namesake “pavement.” Large open areas in this climate system are called ergs. They typically form because of the “rain shadow” effect of a mountain range. For 10 points, name this type of climate characterized by dry conditions and occasionally sand dunes, typified by the Rub al Khali and Sahara.

answer: {Lennard}-{Jones} potential

One modification to this equation involves adding an embedded magnetic dipole. Kihara generalized it to account for non-spherical bodies. Barker and Henderson used a temperature-dependent diameter term in a perturbation theory used with this equation. In addition to the Stockmayer modification of it, another method decomposes the model into two piecewise terms, both with a change at two to the 1/6 sigma. A truncated version sets it to zero at 2.5 times sigma, and it is the basis of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. This equation has a coefficient equal to four times the well depth. One of its terms is based on the Pauli exclusion principle. For 10 points, name this potential used to model molecules, that has a 6th power attractive and 12th power repulsive term.

One theorem named for this man can be used to derive the Wannier functions by applying it to a single band, then summing over the u sub k. One construct named for him is used to model two-level quantum systems, usually qubits. In addition to his namesake sphere, another set of equations named for this man sets the derivative of each component of M t equal to a term proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio plus a term containing T1 and T2. The previous formula decomposes a wavefunction into an exponential term and a periodic term, and applies to particles in a periodic potential. He also lends his name to the transition regions between magnetic domains, his namesake “walls.” For 10 points, name this physicist, who with Purcell, developed NMR.
