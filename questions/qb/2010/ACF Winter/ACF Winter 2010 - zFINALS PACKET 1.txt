answer: {languages} [accept {tongues} or other equivalents]

One account of the formation of these entities is the subject of a chapter of Frazer's Folklore in the Old Testament, in which Frazer treats the myth of the Cholula pyramid and claims that Hermes created these entities for the Greeks. The Sumerian account of Enmerkar tells of how Enki is begged to unify these entities in the “Hymn of Nudimmud,” after which Enmerkar devises a new method of recording them atop the E-ana ziggurat. In another system, these entities were first differentiated as a result of residents of a plain in Shinar who improved their mud-brick-firing skills. In that story, these entities were created because of to punish humankind for showing hubris in trying to reach into heaven. For 10 points, name these entities that the Bible holds were confused after the destruction of the Tower of Babel.

answer: {Euler phi} function [or {Euler totient} function]

The Bell series of this function is equal to one minus x over 1 minus px, while the partial sums of this function show that its average order is equal to 3n divided by pi squared, a result which can be used to find the number of lattice points visible from the origin. The Dirichlet convolution of the identity function N and the Mobius function gives this function, and if a number has r distinct odd prime factors, 2 to the r divides this function of the number. Summing this function over the divisors of a number n gives n. It gives the number of elements in the group Z sub n star, and for a prime number p this function returns p minus 1. Also used in its namesake's generalization of Fermat's Little Theorem, for 10 points, name this function that returns the number of integers less than and relatively prime to the input.

answer: the {Unfinished} Symphony

Leopold Godowsky composed a passacaglia with 44 variations on the opening theme of this work, most later scores of which seem to be based off of the score published by Spina rather than the original monograph. Most drafts omit the sustained B pedal in the first horn and second bassoon at bar 109 in this piece, which open in the cellos and basses before its theme is brought in by the winds. A solo clarinet entrance brings in a second theme before passing to the oboes in the second movement of this work, during which its composer began composing the “Wanderer” Fantasy as well. It was first premiered by Johann Herbeck, who also added a third movement as a finale. For 10 points, name this eighth work by Schubert, so named for only containing two complete movements.

answer: {Boniface}

One briefly-ruling pope of this name was murdered by the holder of the Cadaver Synod, Stephen VI. Another pope of this name was a puppet of the Crescentii family who ordered the murders of Benedict VI and John XIV. A pope of this name crowned Ladislaus of Naples and succeeded Urban VI as the opponent of antipope Clement VII. One of them forced the resignation of his predecessor Clement V, and objected to the imprisonment of Bernard Saisset with Ausculta Fili. That pope of this name was imprisoned at Anagni by Guillaume de Nogaret, and he earlier forbade taxation of the clergy in the bull Clericis Laicos as part of his feud with Philip IV of France. For 10 points, give this papal name whose eighth holder asserted the supremacy of the spiritual over the secular with the bull Unam Sanctam.

answer: {Trevi} Fountain ({Fontana di Trevi})

One story about this artistic piece says that its creator was disgusted by the criticism of his local barber, so he set up a large marble vase in front of his barbershop to block his view of this work. Above a niche on the left of this work, a statue by Andrea Bergondi depicts Agrippa supervising construction of the Aqua Virgo. This piece also contains two allegorical depictions of Abundance and Health by Filippo della Valle, as well as a central sculpture by Pietro Bracci which contains figures often called the “agitated horse” and the “placid horse.” It was originally moved to face the Quirinal Palace by Bernini, but its current form resulted from a contest held by Pope Clement XII and won by Nicola Salvi. For 10 points, name this construction on the Piazza Poli in Rome, a fountain known for collecting coins.

A namesake protein component of this structure is detected by Toll-like Receptor 5. Tg737, whose mutation causes polycystic kidney disease in mice, is responsible for transport within this structure, which is also dependent upon complexes of IFT proteins. Y. Pestis uses a structure homologous to these to inject virulence factors into host cytoplasm, known as the Type III secretory system. They have a P, L, and MS ring in gram-negative bacteria, and in all organisms their central body is called the axonene. In Eukaryotes, they contain a 9+2 set of microtubules around a central pair and use dyenin and ATP hydrolysis to power their whipping motion. Similar to cilia, for 10 points, name these projections used by cells to swim.

answer: {Raman} effect

In one version of this effect, allowing higher order mutipole transitions diminishes its energy. When it emits energy proportional to 3 times the incident frequency plus or minus the frequency of a transition, it's called “hyper.” Techniques based on this effect include a spatially-offset method, and another method involves adsorbing molecules to a rough metal and is enhanced by incident radiation hitting plasmons. Only molecules which undergo a change in polarization via this effect are visible in its namesake form of spectroscopy, which often employs a continuous-wave laser. Emission occurs when the molecule either has a net gain or loss in energy, giving the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines. For 10 points, name this inelastic scattering of light by a molecule, named for an Indian physicist.

answer: Battle of the {Milvian Bridge}

One historian wrote that the victor of this battle later sought purification from a Spaniard named Aegyptus after locking his wife in a hot bath to die. Another account says that the losing commander's body was sunk into the mud the following day, and the mere sight of his head convinced the people to turn away from him. The events leading up to this battle include the death of Ruricius Pompeianus, the praetorian prefect who'd served as a key general for the loser. Prior to the battle, the victor may have crafted a labarum – composed of a straight pike and transverse beam draped by a silken cloth – after witnessing the inscription “In hoc signo vinces” in the sky. For 10 points, name this victory over Maxentius in 312 AD, which allowed the rise of Constantine the Great and is named for a structure near the Tiber River.

answer: {FRET} or [{Forster Resonance} Energy Transfer; or {Fluorescent Resonance} Energy Transfer]

Total internal reflection microscopy is often used in the single-molecule version of this technique, which popularly uses a malemide-based reaction to tag cysteine residues. Its efficiency is directly proportional to an overlap integral dependent on the fourth power of wavelength, and that calculation usually assumes an orientation factor of 2/3, meaning freely rotating dipoles. Cy3 and Cy5 are a popular pair used in this technique, which even more commonly uses CFP and YFP. Dipole-dipole coupling allow transfer of an excited chromophore's energy to an acceptor chromophore in this technique, causing a detectable shift in color when two molecules are close together. For 10 points, name this technique commonly used to screen for protein-protein interactions, in which two molecules are labelled with different dyes and then imaged.

answer: {Das Kapital} [or {Capital}]

This work attempts to discuss a “contradictory movement” that occurs “behind the backs” of the two main parties described within it. One section of this work delves into conditions during the fifteenth and sixteenth century, during which the discovery of gold in the Americas and the driving of peasants off the land accelerated a “primitive” process. This work provides a “general formula” in a chapter that distinguishes between the C-M-C and M-C-M forms of circulation. This work terms the monetization of social relationships as “commodity fetishism.” It sets out a system of value in which an object is worth the amount of work put into it, the labor theory of value. For 10 points, name this economic work edited by Engels and written by Karl Marx.

A “reconciliatory” type of this practice is permitted, but not obligatory, when one wishes to “soften the hearts” of the other side. This doctrine is invoked to derive that it is haram to kill a human being to save one's own life, since it is forbidden when it would lead to the death of an innocent person. It is permitted by a sura in Quran 3:28, and it can lead to a situation called hudna. This practice, which is similar to ketman, was taken up by a religion that does not allow converts, which allows members of the Druze to be very secretive about their beliefs. For 10 points, name this Shi'ite practice of hiding or concealing one's faith during times of imminent danger.

Late in his reign, this emperor constructed a secret central police force headed by Count Pergen, who also designed the education system under him. Around the same time, in a very sickly condition, this emperor commanded an army that famously confused the word “Halt!” for “Allah!” on the eve of battle, resulting in his infantry attacking his cavalry, firing shots in a drunken stupor. His first wife Isabella of Parma died of smallpox long before that blunder in the Battle of Karansebes. His quarrels with Pope Pius VI originated when he attempted to dissolve all contemplative monasteries in his kingdom, though he's better known for issuing the Patent of Religious Toleration and edicts on freedom of the press.
