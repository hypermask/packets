answer: {Vulcans} [or {Vulcanians}]

This culture's most famous custom often involves the greeting “Dif-tor heh smusma.” Their polytheistic religious beliefs include a conception of the soul known as the katra and an Eden known as Sha Ka Ree. The Decapodian tradition of “Claw-Plach” on Futurama is a parody of this culture's mating ritual of koon-ut-kal-if-fee, which occurs when a female refuses marriage during the mating time of pon farr. This race's telepathic abilities allow them to perform their namesake “mind-meld.” Their “Time of the Awakening” began when the philosopher Surak led a revolution that incorporated logic into the very essence of their culture. For 10 points, identify this alien species that includes Tuvok and the half-human Spock, noted for their split-fingered salute.

answer: Donald Ervin {Knuth}

This computer scientist created Metafont to produce vector fonts, but it never caught on with font designers, perhaps due to its sixty parameters. His MMIX is a fictional 64 bit RISC architecture that will replace the MIX architecture, unusual for running in either binary or decimal, as the implementor chooses, and for having bytes of either six binary bits or two decimal digits in the fourth edition of his most famous work, which is currently unfinished, and includes a volume on "Fundamental Algorithms" and fascicles on combinatorial algorithms. Version numbers for Metafont and this man's more famous program approach e and pi, respectively.

In 2001, Link et al. studied the connection between this phenomenon and the self-esteem of patients with mental illnesses, while Gerhard Falk distinguished between the “existential” and “achieved” type of them. Edward E. Jones added six dimensions of these to augment the two levels created by the author of a 1963 work about them. Its author classified the subject concept into three types: bodily, moral, and tribal. He also suggests that they are a gap between virtual and actual social identity and are the mechanisms through which society rationalizes animosity based on differences such as class or race. For 10 points, name these objects of social devaluation which were studied by Erving Goffman and are attributes that cause individuals to be classified in an unacceptable stereotype.

answer: Treaty of {Waitangi}

This treaty voided a document that was partly intended to counter the plans of Charles de Thierry, and this treaty was violated by Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Dissatisfaction with this treaty led to wars fought by the King Movement, and it was partly inspired by one side being ravaged in the Musket Wars. Instructions for this treaty were issued by Lord Normanby, and it was drafted in four days by James Busby and Lieutenant Governor William Hobson. However, the concepts of governorship, or kawanatanga, and chieftainship, or rangatiratanga, were poorly defined due to translation into the native language. For 10 points, name this treaty first signed on February 6, 1840 by Hono Heke and later by over forty other Maori chieftains, which allowed British annexation of New Zealand.

answer: the {Ising} model

The energy of a Hopfield neural network is calculated by noting that the network is equivalent to it. Formulated in matrix terms, the log of its largest eigenvalue is proportional to the free energy. Using a Metropolis algorithm with staying probability e to the negative beta times delta E can be used to solve these models. Istrail found that the three- dimensional versions of them are unsolvable. The energy in this system is equal to the sum of S sub I times S sub J times an interaction term J sub ij. A 2-dimensional version of it was solved by Onsager. Sherrington and Kirkpatrick added frustration terms to it in order to model spin glasses. Its critical fluctuations correctly model the behavior at the critical point. For 10 points, name this model which is used to model magnetic materials as a collection of spins.

answer: {electrolysis}

The Castner-Kellner process uses this method to produce alkali hydroxide, and it was applied to heavy water in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment that discredited cold fusion. First discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, it was later used by Moissan on potassium hydrogen difluoride in hydrogen fluoride to produce fluorine. The amount of chemical change produced in a given substance by a given amount of charge is proportional to its equivalent weight according to one of two laws formulated by Faraday concerning this process. Anodization and the Hall- Heroult process both make use of this process. For 10 points, name this process that typically involves a liquid medium and two electrodes and uses a current to decompose chemicals.
