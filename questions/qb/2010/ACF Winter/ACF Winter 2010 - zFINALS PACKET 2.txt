Experiments by DeVries and Correns explained the "xenia" effect observed in this organism by invoking double fertilization. These organisms, which have distinctive male inflorescence are closely related to the "teosinte" grasses. Experiments on the triploid aleurone layers of its endosperm led to the discovery of the Ac/Ds system which confers varying colour patters in this organism; that experiment led to a Nobel Prize for Barbara McClintock's discovery of transposons.

answer: {HIV} [or {human immunodeficiency virus}]

The major structural proteins of these entities use the PTAP motif to recruit the ESCRT-1 ["escort-one"] complex and the LYPxL motif to recruit the ALIX protein in order to facilitate the budding process. In addition to possessing the Gag polyprotein, these entities produce the Vif protein which counteracts the effects of the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G. They are unable to infect individuals who possess a homozygous 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 protein. The glycoprotein gp120 found on them allows them to dock onto CD4 receptors, and azidothymidine is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is used to treat infections by this agent. For 10 points, name this retrovirus that mostly infects immune cells and which causes AIDS.

answer: {activation} energy

The Vyazovkin MFK technique allows for the calculation of this quantity in terms of the conversion rate. In the rate- process theory for viscosity developed by Eyring, an analogue of this quantity is measures the formation of "holes" which fluid molecules can occupy. For gas phase reactions, this quantity is equal to the enthalpy of formation of the transition state minus 2 RT, and the height of a potential barrier in a reaction profile is analogous to this quantity. It appears in the exponential term of the Arrhenius equation, enzymes and catalysts lower this quantity of a reaction. For 10 points, identify this energy which the reactants must overcome before they can proceed to the products of the reaction.

answer: Bekenstein-{Hawking} radiation [prompt on {black}-{body radiation}]

Near the Cauchy horizon, a Rindler observer will see an analogue to this phenomenon in the Unruh effect. Its namesake temperature is proportional to the surface gravity of its source. The size of bodies in which this phenomenon originates must be small, because increasing mass decreases the power of it. It happens when a particle resulting from pair production tunnels through the event horizon. The no-hair theorem mandates that this phenomenon be in a mixed state, even for the input of a pure quantum state, a result at odds with Liouville's theorem that results in an “information paradox.” This phenomenon eventually leads to black hole evaporation. For 10 points, name this thermal radiation named for the author of A Brief History of Time.
