answer: {four}-{color} theorem [or {Guthrie's problem}]

One unproven generalization of this theorem is equivalent to the statement that chi of G is equal to or greater than the Hadwiger number of G. It is equivalent to the statement that no snark is planar. Another generalization of this theorem was proven by Ringel and Youngs and depends on the floor of an expression involving the square root of 1 plus 48g. It was proven by finding an unavoidable set of reducible configurations, using the method of discharging; a later proof improved on the quartic time algorithm used. It is a special case of the Heawood conjecture. For 10 points, name this theorem proved by Appel and Hankin via computer, which gives the minimum number of shades necessary to produce a map.

Using this system to model solvated electrons in a solution of lithium in ammonia correctly derives the wavelength of said solution's color. Modeling an alpha particle in a nucleus as this system leads to the Geiger-Nuttall formula. Assuming a deep well in the quantum-confined Stark effect allows the estimation of its energies by treating it as this system, while an iterated version of this system in one dimension gives the Kronig-Penny model. The square root of 2 over L is the normalizing constant for this system, whose energy levels correspond to n squared h squared over 8 m L. For 10 points, name this quantum system in which an object is trapped in a square container.

answer: mass {spectrometry} [or mass {spectroscopy}; or {MS}]

A method of preparing samples for this technique without significantly altering their environment is DART. Samples are usually prepared either via adding a sample to a crystal and then firing a laser at it, or by dispersion in aerosol form and subsequent evaporation. Most analyzers in this technique can rely on a quadrupole ion trap or use a reflectron to measure the time of flight. A tandem version of it is commonly used to sequence proteins, and the aforementioned techniques are used to ionize the sample before it is fragmented. It is often preceded by gas or liquid chromatography. For 10 points, name this technique in which a sample is separated into pieces and analyzed via their mass to charge ratio.

answer: The {Division} of {Labor} in Society [or De La {Division Du Travail Social}]

The final chapter of this book discusses an "abnormal form" of the title concept in which poor regulation prompts a decrease in "functional activity." Its seventh chapter largely refutes Spencer's theory of contracts, stating that positive control is on the rise due to the fundamentally restitutive nature of modern laws. This work contrasts such restitutive systems with the typically repressive systems of primitive peoples, where common experiences prompt a mechanical solidarity that is fundamentally different from the organic solidarity of modern society. Organic solidarity is then said to derive from the title concept, which increases productivity yet leads to the alienation of the individual as well as anomie. For 10 points, name this 1893 magnum opus of French sociologist Émile Durkheim.

One protein in this pathway has a G20210A mutant. This pathway is aberrantly activated by anti-phospholipid antibodies, while one pathway to initiate it relies on high-molecular weight kininogen. The aPTT and PT tests can be used to determine if particular proteins in this pathway are defective; said proteins include Hageman factor and another whose mutation causes Christmas disease. Most of the proteins in this pathway are serine proteases that cleave each other, one of which is bound to von Willebrand factor. For 10 points, name this cascade that includes Factors V, VIII, IX, X, etc, responsible for stopping the flow of blood at wounds.
