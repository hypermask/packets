She was the only figure who could bring Hrungnir more ale to drink until Thor was called to eliminate him. This mother of Hnoss travelled the world in order to find her husband. This owner of the boar Hildisvini also owned a cape of falcon feathers that allowed her to fly and a chariot that was pulled by cats.

answer: {cyclopropane}

Pyrethrin contains one of these molecules bridging an ester and an alkene moiety, and 1-1-1-propellene contains three of these molecules fused together. DBU and a diethyl malonate derivative are used to add this moeity to a fullerene in the Bingel reaction, and its bonds have partial pi character according to the Walsh orbital model. Adding a carbene to an alkene is another way of generating it; that same transformation can be performed via the Simmons- Smith reaction. Bent or banana bonding is used to explain how it relieves its incredible ring strain, which occurs due to the sixty degree angles between its carbon-carbon bonds. For 10 points, name this compound consisting of three carbons in a ring.

This experiment was used to derive a value of the parameter epsilon equal to approximately .0023, which was later more accurately measured by the Fermilab KTeV and CERN NA48 experiments. The detectors in this experiment were a set of spark chambers with magnets angled at 22 degrees, while the apparatus itself consisted of a 57-foot tube with a particle beam pointed at one side. The experiment made use of the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient synchrotron, and about one in five hundred of the detected particles were the product of the faster decay process, many more than expected. Winning its namesakes the 1980 Nobel, for 10 points, name this experiment, which used the decay of kaons into pions to show direct CP violation.

answer: Margaret {Mead}

One work by this writer introduces the idea of “postfigurative, cofigurative and prefigurative” societies. This writer's autobiography takes its name from a regional expression for a late cold spell that ruins a certain crop. The most vocal critic of this writer's work has attacked a commitment to write “for the Bishop Museum” and this writer's relationship with Dr. Charles Lane. Those attacks have come in books that describe “the Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth” and this writer being subject to “a Fateful Hoaxing.” Those attacks, launched by Derek Freeman, have claimed that this anthropologist misunderstood or was lied to by the teenage girls like Lola and Mala on the island of Ta'u.

Many of these objects are expected to be detected by NASA's WISE infrared space telescope. Gliese 229B was determined to be one of these objects through the detection of methane in its atmosphere, but a more common method to detect these objects is the lithium test. The spectral classes T, L, and Y were created in order to classify these objects, which appear on the absolute bottom right of the HR diagram. A fringe theory posits that one of these objects sends objects from the Oort cloud into the inner Solar System, which in turn causes mass extinctions on Earth; that one is the alleged twin star of the Sun called Nemesis. For 10 points, identify these low mass “failed stars,” which are not massive enough to fuse hydrogen in their cores.

answer: Battle of {Narva}

Prior to this battle, the double-crossing Johann Gummert was hanged in effigy by one side, then actually hanged by the other.

Its victor failed to immediately follow up his advantage, instead working to place his puppet Stanislaus Leszczynski on the Polish throne. The losing forces here were commanded by the Duke de Cröy, who was crushed when a blizzard blown into his men's faces aided the decisive charge by Count Rehnskjöld. It occurred when Russian forces were caught besieging the namesake Estonian fortress, though the result of this battle would be reversed nine years later at Poltava. For 10 points, name this victory for Charles XII and Sweden early in the Great Northern War.

One character in this play points out that naming a female character “Sulla” is inaccurate.

answer: {Sutton Hoo}

In 2000, the “Bromeswell Bucket,” a bronze vessel suspected to be of Byzantine origin, was found at this place. The ornamentations found on a shield discovered at this site have been linked to similar ones found near Uppsala in Sweden.
