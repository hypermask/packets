answer: {taxes} [do not accept {more specific} answers]

Both the Atkinson-Stiglitz Separability theorem and the Cortlett-Hague theorem relate this quantity for commodities to goods that are substitutable for leisure. The Lindahl form of this entity is employed in an equilibrium dependent on the personal marginal benefit of a public good. Christina and David Romer's recent study found the multiplier of a reduction in this entity to be roughly three. Ramsey developed an optimal set of rules based on the quantity demanded of each good to minimize total burden. Externalities can be limited by the Pigouvian type of them. Deadweight losses are caused by the imposition of, for 10 points, which financial charges collected by the government to finance the nation's budget?

answer: the {counties} of {Ireland}

Subdivisions of these units of land were once called cantreds, but that term was superseded by divisions of them known as baronies. The Chief Herald of the nation in which these divisions of land lie has granted many of them coats of armor since 1943, including a seal that depicts Patrick Sarsfield outstretching his hand. Naas is the seat of government of one of these units. The King's and Queen's examples of these units were established during the British Plantations movement in their home country, and those ones are today known as Offaly and Laois. These units are subdivisions of larger provinces like Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. For 10 points, name these divisions of land that include Limerick, Tipperary, and Cork, and are located on the Emerald Isle.

answer: The {Spanish Tragedy}

In one scene of this play, a character talks about the scarf he retrieved from the corpse of his slain friend with his lover. Earlier, the audience indirectly learns that the three judges of the underworld debated whether to place one character in this play in the Martian field or the field of love before sending him to Pluto and Proserpine. The climactic scene occurs during a performance of a play-within-this-play called Soliman and Perseda. Don Andrea forms the chorus of this play, accompanied by the spirit of Revenge. After Pedrigano helps Serberine kill Lorenzo's rival for Bel-Imperia's love, Hieronimo goes insane and takes revenge on everyone. For 10 points, essentially all the major male characters are dead by the end of which work by Thomas Kyd?

answer: {hydroboration}-oxidation

A dioxane-chloro version of the reagent in this reaction was developed by Kanth to increase selectivity for terminal substrates. Padra and Node developed the odorless reagents Dod-S-Me and MMS for this reaction. A common reagent used in this reaction is synthesized by adding 1,5-cyclooctadiene and some dimethyl sulfide to another compound. Its second stage involves addition of a hydroperoxide anion followed by a rearrangement with retention of configuration, while skipping that step allows the reactant to undergo a Suzuki coupling. The initial step of this reaction occurs with a particular stereochemistry due to steric hindrance, resulting in an anti-Markovnikov product. For 10 points, name this method of adding hydroxyl groups to alkenes, using boron.

answer: {Brownian} motion

One equation used to describe this process states that m a is equal to F x minus beta times the velocity vector plus eta of t. Levy stated that a process X is one of these if it is its own natural filtration and if X sub I times X sub J minus Kronecker sub ij times t for all I and J is a martingale. This physical process is the classical example of a Wiener process, and Feynman developed a thought experiment that uses a ratchet to derive work from this process. This process is described by the Langevin equation, while it is used to predict the size of molecules based on one of Einstein's Annus Mirabilis papers. It was first observed by its namesake via pollen grains in water. For 10 points, name this random movement of particles in a fluid.

answer: {Gram} stain

Alternatives to this procedure include the potassium hydroxide string test, and a process that creates a yellow solution by stimulating the release of 4-nitroaniline, the aminopeptidase test. It is partially used to determine the amount of techoic acid present in a sample, and the Zheil-Neelsen procedure can be used when this is inconclusive. Results of this process are not conclusive for Rickettsia, spirochetes, or a genus of agents whose members cause leprosy and tetanus. It typically employs an iodine mordant, and methylene blue is used as a primary agent for organisms that do not respond well to crystal violet. It differentiates organisms by the amount of peptidoglycan present in their cell walls. For 10 points, name this stain for which bacteria can be either negative or positive.

answer: Leonid Ilich {Brezhnev}

This man was the target of an assassination attempt by Viktor Ilyin. His official cult of personality was centered on an exaggerated version of his role at Malaya Zemlya. This leader's negotiations with a rival nation's leader failed to prevent the passage of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which proposed sanctioning his nation. This leader shared power with Nikolai Podgorny and Aleksey Kosygin, and he negotiated SALT II and initiated détente. The Pravda article “Sovereignty and the International Obligations of Socialist Countries” introduced a policy named for this man that justified intervention in other socialist nations; that policy was his namesake doctrine that led to his invasion of Afghanistan. For 10 points each, name this leader effectively in charge of the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982.

One of these constructs is called perfect if it is equal to its own commutator. The purpose of the Hölder program was to classify a certain type of these. Those of odd order are solvable according to the Feit-Thompson theorem. Any one of these of prime order is also cyclic. Symmetric types of this algebraic structure consist of permutations of a given number of elements. Examples of these include one that has a 194 by 194 character table created by Fisher and Greiss. One of these of order six is the smallest one of these that is non-commutative. They must be associative and have an identity, inverses and a zero element, and Abelian ones are commutative. For 10 points, name these algebraic structures that consist of a set and a binary operation performed on that set.

One work by this philosopher disagrees with P.F. Strawson's rejection of the “no-ownership” theory. This philosopher defended his distinction between veridical and non-veridical perception and advanced an epistemology he called “sophisticated realism,” a position attacked for its dependence on sense-data in J.L. Austin's Sense and Sensibilia. This thinker's “right to be sure” concept of knowledge was attacked by Edmund Gettier. This man advanced an ethical theory called emotivism. His best-known work contains chapters such as “The Function of Philosophy” and “The Elimination of Metaphysics” and champions the verificationist principle. For 10 points, name this British logical positivist philosopher, the author of Language, Truth, and Logic.

One order of this taxonomic class of animals is known as Polypteriformes and can only be found in Africa. That order is found in the subclass Sarcopterygii, and an infraclass of this group is known as Teleostei and has the most members. Primitive members have ganoid scales, while more modern ones can exhibit cycloid scales that have annuli which can be used to predict age. An operculum covering the gills is present in all these organisms as well as a swim bladder. For 10 points, identify this class of vertebrates separated into 'fleshy-finned' and ‘ray-finned,' and whose main difference with Chondrichthyes is their bony skeleton.
