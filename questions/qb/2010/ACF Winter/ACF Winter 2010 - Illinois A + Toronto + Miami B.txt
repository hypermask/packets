answer: Battle of {Helm's Deep} [or {Siege} of {Helm's Deep}; or Battle of the {Hornburg}; prompt on anything

Shortly before this event, the official leader of one side said that “The days have gone down in the West, behind the hills, into shadow” and later claimed that his men could not win against “such reckless hate.” The attackers' escape route was blocked by a force of Huorns, while the defenders were reinforced by a group coming from the Fords of Isen led by Erkenbrand. Before this event began, one participant remarked “That is no orc horn!” The defenders in this event were forced to retreat to the Glittering Caves after the attackers used “blasting-fire” to open a hole in the Deeping Wall. For 10 points, name this battle fought at the titular mountain fortress between the men of Rohan and Saruman's Uruk-Hai, which ended after Gandalf's cavalry charge and which was featured in The Two Towers.

answer: {Austro}-{Prussian} War [or {Seven Weeks} War; prompt on {German War}; prompt on {Unification War}]

Three years before this conflict, another conflict was sparked by the November Constitution, the culmination of the Eider Program. This conflict was temporarily averted by the Convention of Gastein, and a preliminary peace was arranged at Nikolsburg. Albrecht Roon organized this conflict's victorious army, which utilized a new breech- loading rifle, the needle gun. A side theater to this war included the Second Battle of Custoza and resulted in the loss of Venetia. This war was resolved by the Treaty of Prague after the victory at Koniggratz by Helmut von Moltke. It began with a dispute over Schleswig and Holstein. For 10 points, name this first major conflict in Bismarck's quest for German unification, a very short war between two major German powers.

answer: {tokamaks} [accept {spheromaks} before “{JET}”; prompt on {fusion reactors}; or {plasma devices}]

The equation governing these systems sets the minor-radius laplacian of psi equal to the sum of terms containing the derivative of pressure in terms of psi minus a term containing the poloidal current times its derivative; that equation is the Grad-Shafranov equation. One effect in these objects is a shift of the center of density away from the geometric center, a shift likewise named for Shafranov. Confinement in these devices occurs due to a driven torodial plasma current; these devices are thus similar to stellerators, which have additional helical coils. The largest of them currently in operation is JET, which will be replaced by ITER when the latter is complete. For 10 points, name these toroidal magnetic confinement devices for hot plasmas which are candidates as nuclear fusion reactors.

answer: the {Forsytes}

The unknown early progenitors of these people are consistently described as “very small beer.” This group experiences a form of apotheosis in the marriage of Michael Mont to one of its members. A so-called Buccaneer who was to marry into this family died shortly after losing a lawsuit. That man, Philip Bosinney, was sued due to his affair with a woman he met while designing a house at Robin Hill subsequently owned by four different members of this family. Irene provokes the Indian summer of this family's Old Jolyon and marries its Young Jolyon after divorcing this family's patriarch, Soames. For 10 points, name this archetypal Victorian family, the subject of a saga consisting of To Let, In Chancery and The Man of Property, all by John Galsworthy.

answer: James {Ensor}

In one of this man's works, a man on the right sitting cross-legged turns his head to watch a woman playing the piano. In another work, he depicted a woman opening a door and greeting a man sitting at a table while wearing a mask with a long nose. This artist of Russian Music painted a work in which a line of figures react with disgust at the sight of doctors experimenting on a monkey. In another of his paintings, skeletons duel with mops and brooms under the title character, who holds a sign saying “CIVET.” This artist of The Scandalized Masks, The Vile Vivisectors, and Skeletons Fighting over a Hanged Man depicted a crowd of people with masks under a banner that reads “Vive La Sociale!” in another work. For 10 points, name this Belgian painter of Christ's Entry into Brussels.

answer: {GPCRs} [or {G}-{protein coupled} receptors; or {Serpentine} receptors; accept {G proteins} until “{Frizzled}”;

Graminski and Lerner's melanophore screen is used to screen these proteins for drug targets, while other assays for that purpose include Arena pharmaceuticals' CART. Examples of them include Frizzled and Smoothened, and opsins have a structure similar to them. Axel and Buck determined that types of these proteins are responsible for sensing odorant molecules. These proteins interact with and activate Gustdusin and Transducin. Phosphorylation of these proteins leads to arrestin binding, which causes clathrin to drag them out of the cell membrane. Upon ligand binding, these proteins split their partners into the alpha and beta-gamma subunits, leading to increasing cAMP or IP3 levels. For 10 points, name these 7-pass transmembrane receptors, named their activation of G proteins.

answer: {Long Day's Journey} into glyph817ight

One scene in this work recounts the story of Shaughnessy's squabble with Harker, the Standard Oil millionaire. One character is accused of infecting a baby with measles in one scene of this work, while another scene sees Cathleen discusses one character's former dreams of becoming a professional pianist. One character in this play is an actor who resents being associated with the one role that made him famous, though he has just bought a new “vehicle” for himself. Throughout this play, Doc Hardy is called a “quack” for his treatment of James's wife, who declares that she will become a nun during a hallucination. For 10 points, Edmund's affliction of tuberculosis and Mary's addiction to morphine is revealed to the rest of the Tyrone family at the end of what play by Eugene O'Neill?

answer: Bela {Bartok}

This man composed choral work based on a colinda about sons turned into stags called “Cantata Profana.” The piano suite Out of Doors was completed by this composer of the trio Contrasts and the solo piano piece “Allegro barbaro.” A third piano concerto and a viola concerto were left unfinished at his death, while another of his works features a second section called “Game of the Couples” and a fourth section parodying Shostakovich's Leningrad Symphony. A plucked string that rebounds off the fingerboard is known as his “pizzicato,” while “Six Dances in Bulgarian Rhythm” are part of his set of 153 piano pieces. The composer of Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta, this is, for 10 points, which Hungarian composer of Concerto for Orchestra and Mikrokosmos?

answer: {lend}-{lease} program [accept {Lend}-{Lease Act}]

The proposal for this program included a comparison to putting out a house fire with a garden hose, and explained why it would not violate the Johnson Act. This program was opposed by a group headed by Robert E. Wood, and among those who expedited its operation were W. Averell Harriman and Maxwell Aitken. Edward Stettinius briefly headed this program, which was also led by Harry Hopkins. The inception of this program was supported in the “arsenal of democracy” speech, and this successor to Cash and Carry ultimately resulted in over forty-nine billion dollars in aid, mainly to Britain. For 10 points, name this program created by a namesake 1941 act that allowed FDR to send war materials to American allies.

answer: the {Lagrangian} [or {Lagrange} function; prompt on {L}]

Degrees of freedom on which this object is not explicitly dependent are known as cyclic coordinates and correspond to conservation of conjugate momenta. The Euler equations of systems are in general relations of derivatives of this mathematical object because they are derived by extremizing the time integral of this function. This quantity is dependent in general on a system's set of generalized coordinates and speeds, so it can be seen to be the momentum- to-speed Legendre transform of a similar function. This function is heuristically equal to the difference between the kinetic and potential energies of a system. For 10 points, name this function central to a formulation of mechanics complementary to the Newtonian and Hamiltonian formulations.

answer: {Guru Nanak} Dev Ji

This man angered Muslims by sleeping with his feet towards the Kaaba while in Mecca, after which he claimed that there was no way to sleep without pointing one's feet at God's house, since it is everywhere. Bhai Bala composed the most influential of the biographies of this man's life, which are called Janamsakhis. He disappeared while bathing in the Kali Bein. This man's followers argued over whether to cremate his body or bury it; the pro- cremation crowd cremated the flowers they had left for him, while the pro-buriers buried their flowers. His religious project was summed up by the quote “There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim,” which led him to found a religious office currently occupied by a book, the Adi Granth. For 10 points, name this first guru and founder of Sikhism.

answer: Robert Browning

In one work by this man, Dirck's horse Roos gives out near Hasselt and Joris's dies after sighting a “dome-spire” by Dalhem, but the speaker's “horse without peer,” Roland, survives the titular trip. The speaker claims he could “blend all hideous sins, as in a cup” because he has “God's warrant” in another poem by this man. This author of “How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix” paired “Johannes Agricola in Meditation” in Madhouse Cells with a work whose speaker claims “And yet God has not said a word!” after he strangles a woman with her own hair. The speaker of another of his poems notes that its title figure, the subject of a Fra Pandolf painting, “had a heart too soon made glad.” For 10 points, name this British author of “Porphyria's Lover” and “My Last Duchess.”
