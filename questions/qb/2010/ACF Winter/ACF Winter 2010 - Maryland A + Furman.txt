answer: {abscisic acid} [accept {abscicin II}; accept {dormin} before read]

Umezawa et al showed that the signaling of this molecule is regulated by protein phosphatase 2C. The pathway for the synthesis of this compound begins with a zeaxanthin precursor and ends with the cleavage of a C40 carotenoid into xanthoxin, which is finally oxidized to this molecule; that process of this molecule's synthesis is called the MEP pathway. Functions of this hormone include promoting gene transcription for proteinase inhibitors in response to wounding and producing a-amylase in order to act against the effects of gibberellins. It also plays a major function in regulating the closure of the stomata. For 10 points, name this plant hormone that is sometimes called dormin, which is responsible for the inhibition of seed germination, fruit ripening and budding.

answer: Vincenzo Salvatore Carmelo Francesco {Bellini}

In one work, this composer used the mourning chorus “Pace alla tua bell'amina” to interrupt the duet “Stolto! a un sol mio grido,” which was about to lead to a duel between Tebaldo and Romeo. He required another opera's primary tenor to hit the F above high C; that opera by this man sees Elvira go crazy after the Royalist Arturo becomes a fugitive. This composer of I Capuleti e i Montecchi also created a work in which Elvino refuses to believe in Amina's innocence until she crosses the dangerous mill bridge, proving she's the title character.

answer: {Claisen} condensation

Enzymatic instances of this reaction are catalyzed by bacterial type II fatty acid synthesis enzymes, and by Chalcone synthase, which contain a Thiolase fold. A modification of it replaces a reactant with succinate, while a classic version of it occurs between ethyl benzoate and acetophenone, the former of which is not enolizable. It is driven by the removal of a doubly-alpha proton in the final product and the subsequent resonance stabilization of the negative charge, and its modifications include the Stobbe and crossed varieties. An intramolecular version of this reaction is used to create five- or six-member rings and is named for Dieckmann. For 10 points, name this condensation reaction that forms beta-keto-esters, the ester counterpart of the aldol condensation.

This thinker attacked his predecessors by claiming that Homer should be beaten and that Pythagoras was a swindler. He held that thinking was common to all things, and a scholarly debate exists over whether or not he thought that the psyches of the best men were immortal. This thinker argued that contraries are co-present in objects, using the example of “the bow and the lyre,” in his doctrine of Unity of Opposites. This man proposed that the world was driven by logos, and he argued for another doctrine that was at odds with the main theory of Parmenides. For 10 points, name this philosopher who argued that the world was in a state of eternal flux, claimed that fire was the basic element, and supposedly said that you cannot step into the same river twice.

answer: “{Moonlight Sonata}” [or Piano {Sonata No.} 14 in {C}-{Sharp Minor} “Quasi una fantasia”]

This piece's second movement was described by Franz Liszt as “a flower between two chasms,” and that scherzo movement switches over to the major key and repeats its short melody twenty times throughout the piece. This work's mostly pianissimo first movement is instructed to be played with the sustain pedal depressed the entire time, and consists of both a theme which is accented at the beginning of each measure and a constant ostinato triplet motive. This piece's third movement uses a plethora of sforzando notes which gives this piano section a stormy quality and is given the tempo marking “presto agitato.” For 10 points, identify this C-minor “Quasi una fantasia” work by Beethoven that was given its nickname due to its semblance to illumination upon Lake Lucerne.

answer: {phonons}

At low temperatures, the mean free path of these particles is comparable with the dimensions of their propagation medium in the de Haas-Biermasz effect. One mechanism for the collision of these particles theorizes that the sum of the wave vectors of the original particles is equal to the final wave vector plus a reciprocal primitive translation vector, the Umklapp process. These particles always have 3 acoustic modes for a substance with greater than two atoms per unit cell. Their density of states is used to derive that the heat capacity is proportional to T cubed in the Debye Model. They drive the pairing of electrons into Cooper pairs in the BCS theory of superconductivity. For 10 points, name these bosons that propagate at the speed of sound in a solid, described as quantized lattice vibrations.

answer: {field} [accept {rational domain} until mentioned, prompt on {commutative division algebra} until

The category of these objects has the property that every morphism is a monomorphism. The spectrum of one of these objects contains one point, and the p-adic numbers for a given p form one of these. These objects necessarily have zero Krull dimension. Those with a finite number of elements have order equal to a power of a prime. Their extensions have a one-to-one correspondence with their intermediates according to the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. A division algebra is one of these without multiplicative commutativity, and can be defined as a ring with multiplicative identity, inverse, and commutativity.

answer: {catalytic contact} process

One intermediate output of this process is described as "fuming," and it ideally runs at 450 degrees centigrade. To ensure a purer end product, the gaseous products pass through absorption towers multiple times in this process's DCDA portion. Platinum catalysts were abandoned in favor of less efficient vanadium oxide catalysts to reduce the risk of poisoning in this process, byproducts of which process include oleum and sulfur trioxide. It is much more efficient than the previously used lead-chamber process. For 10 points, name this chemical process developed by a vinegar merchant which can use pyrite as an input, the preferred industrial method of producing sulfuric acid.
