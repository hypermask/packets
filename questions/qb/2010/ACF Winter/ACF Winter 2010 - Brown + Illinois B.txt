answer: Jean Auguste Dominique {Ingres}

In one of this man's paintings, one character oddly uses her left hand to grasp the red-cloaked character's chin while her right hand sits at his knee. Alabaster statues of soldiers lie strewn in the clouds above the red-caped title figure in one work by this painter, who also depicted a nude woman with her head tilted back as a hero arrives on a hippogriff in another painting. This painter of Jupiter and Thetis, The Dream of Ossian, and Roger Freeing Angelica may be better known for depicting a character about to be crowned by Nike with Moliere and Herodotus among those around him. He also painted a work featuring a concubine with elongated proportions. For 10 points, name this French Neoclassicist painter of The Apotheosis of Homer and La Grande Odalisque.

answer: the {Mekong} River

This is the central of the “Three Parallel Rivers” that name a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Pak Mun dam is located at the confluence of this river and its tributary, the Mun River. A “Friendship Bridge” spanning this river forces users to change over driving side when going from Savannakhet Province to Mukdahan Province. Pyotr Kozlov discovered that this river's source is the Lasagongma Spring on Mount Guozongmucha. Runoff from the Tonle Sap reservoir enters this river when the Tonle Sap River is formed. This river flows through Yunnan Province from its origin on the Tibetan Plateau, and it flows through Thailand, Burma, Laos, and Cambodia before emptying at its namesake delta in Vietnam. For 10 points, name this principle river of Southeast Asia.

answer: {microtubules}

Mutations in the EFHC1 gene were recently found to disrupt their formation, which is inhibited by nocodazole in flow cytometry. Stathmin and Tektin interact with these structures, and they oscillate between "catastrophe" and "rescue" in a process called dynamic instability. The Gamma-TuRC complex assists with their formation. Drugs like Colchicine disrupt the dynamics of these structures. Dyein is a motor protein which moves toward the minus end of them, while kinesin moves toward the plus end. Nine doublets of them surround two singlets in flagella and cilia, and they form the spindle fibers that separate chromosomes during mitosis. For 10 points, name these structures composed of tubulin, which, along with microfilaments and intermediate filaments, make up the cytoskeleton.

answer: {electromagnetism} [accept word forms]

The wavefunction of a two-particle system in a bound state that interacts through this fundamental force is given by the Bethe-Saltpeter equation. The gauge boson controlling this interaction obeys a form of the Klein-Gordon equation in which the energy is given by the product of the momentum and the speed of light. This interaction is described by the U(1) symmetry group. Powers of its coupling constant appear in derivations of fine and hyperfine structure. The only interaction mediated by a massless particle, the Glashow-Weinberg-Salaam theory unifies this force with the weak force. Its quantized form is graphically described by Feynman diagrams. For 10 points, name this fundamental force, which is described by the Maxwell equations and which is mediated by photons.

Paul Benacerraf used a story about Ernie and Johnny to argue that not all identities are meaningful in a paper that aims to show "what," these objects "could not be." The Heyting theory of these objects is central to the intuitionism advocated by L.E.J. Brouwer. Edmund Husserl's Habilitationschrift was a lecture delivered "on the concept of," these objects. John Stuart Mill argued that each of these objects "denotes physical phenomena.” Aristotle's Metaphysics claims that Plato thought that the Forms were these. Gottlob Frege used the ancestral relation to demonstrate that natural ones can be derived from Hume's Principle, yielding the Peano axioms in his The Foundations of Arithmetic. For 10 points, identify these objects used to represent quantities.

One section of this work follows five men wearing an advertisement for Wisdom Hely's on their hats. Another of its sections sees the protagonist rescued from a shouting match with The Citizen by the arrival of Martin Cunningham. One character in this work gets his pay from Garrett Deasy, and wakes up with his friend and the Englishman Haines in a Martello tower. This novel's protagonist climaxes as a Roman candle explodes after watching Gerty MacDowell at the beach and masturbating, in the episode “Nausicaa.” Blazes Boylan has an affair with its protagonist's wife Molly, whose “soliloquy” ends this book. For 10 points, name this novel, which parallels the wanderings of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom's with the events of the Odyssey, a work of James Joyce.

answer: {violin sonatas} [prompt on partial answer]

One work of this form in A-major incorporates a Recitativo-Fantasia and was written for Eugéne Ysaÿe by Cesar Franck. Schumann, Brahms, and Albert Dietrich collaborated on the F-A-E one, and the fifth one by Beethoven is popularly called the "Spring" due to its sunny disposition. Another of these works ends with a 6/8 tarantella in rondo form and was originally dedicated to George Bridgetower, but Bridgetower's drunken remarks convinced the composer to rename it. Tartini wrote an extremely technically demanding one called “Devil's Trill,” while Johann Sebastian Bach paired three of these works with three partitas for the same solo instrument. For 10 points, name this genre of works for a string instrument, exemplified by Beethoven's “Kreutzer” one.

answer: {analyticity} [or {holomorphicity}; accept {complex differentiable} before mention]

A function with specified zeros and specified orders of those zeros that also has this property exists as a consequence of the Weierstrass Product Theorem. According to a theorem of Liouville, a function that is bounded and has this property everywhere must be constant. A function that has this property on a closed region may be expanded in a Laurent series within that region, and that function has this property if it satisfies the Cauchy- Riemann equations within that region. The real parts of functions with this property are harmonic, and a function may fail to have this property in the complex plane due to the presence of poles or branch cuts. For 10 points, identify this property of a complex-valued function, which is equivalent to being complex differentiable.

The signing of this treaty was followed by negotiations between Thomas von Fritsch and Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg, while this treaty was negotiated by César Gabriel de Choiseul. This treaty was signed a year after the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau. It accompanied the Treaty of Hubertusburg, which decided control of Silesia. This treaty was partly precipitated by the death of the empress Elizabeth, and the Earl of Bute controversially decided not to keep Guadeloupe in this treaty. As a corollary to this treaty, Spain gained Louisiana, and in this treaty Britain gained Grenada, Tobago, and Florida, as well as almost all French possessions in North America.

Luigi Pasinetti created a mathematical system formalizing the growth theory of this thinker, a scholar of whom is J. H. Hollander. Piero Sraffa collected the works of this thinker, whom Robert Barro credited with influencing his suggestion that the timing of tax changes does not affect consumer spending. This man argued in one essay that raised tariffs on grain imports raised rents and lowered profits of manufacturers. He is credited with introducing the differential theory of rent and the law of diminishing returns. Later, this man with a namesake equivalence principle proposed his labor-embodied theory of value.

answer: {Huckel's} rule

One method of deriving this statement is solving Schrodinger's equation for the condition psi of theta equals psi of 2 pi plus theta, giving a wavefunction proportional to e to the plus or minus i n pi. It can also be derived by noting that the systems in question contain one low-lying bonding molecular orbital followed by a series of paired MOs at higher energies. Hirsch, Chen, and Jiao developed a three-dimensional version of this statement that applies to fullerenes, while another method that leads to it assumes zero-differential overlap, a computational method named for Pariser, Parr, and Pople. It applies to planar systems with conjugated double bonds. For 10 points, name this rule that states a molecule with 4n plus 2 pi electrons is aromatic, named for a German.
