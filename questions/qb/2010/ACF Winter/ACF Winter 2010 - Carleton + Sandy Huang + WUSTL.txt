answer: {Nestorianism} [accept word forms]

This belief was officially installed in one land with the Synod of Beth Lapat, presided over by Barsauma and other members of the school of Nisibis. This belief was attacked by Philip Sidetes and by Proclus, and The Bazaar of Heraclides is an apology for it. The actual nature of its main doctrine is indeterminate because of the use of the word prosopon, and this heresy was attacked in twelve anathemas. Theodore of Mopsuestia was a precursor of this heresy, and it involved the rejection of the title Theotokos, leading to it being denounced by Cyril of Alexandria at the Council of Ephesus. This heresy was prominent in Antioch and the east, and it held that Christ had two distinct natures. For 10 points, identify this heresy named for a Patriarch of Constantinople.

One work about this concept considered a quote from Longfellow's “The Builders” and an anecdote in which Fania Pascal was told that she didn't “know what a dog that has been run over feels like” as examples of Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophical opposition to it. In a 2005 interview on The Daily Show, the author of that work claimed that the desire to “produce an impression” is what distinguishes this concept from spin.

answer: {NAD} [or {Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide}; accept {NADH}]

Along with Hemin, this compound is needed to grow hemophilius influenzae in culture. It commonly serves as a donor for ADP-ribosyltransferase enzymes. This compound has a single absorption peak at 259 nm and gains a peak at 340 meters upon being converted to a related molecule. The ratio between it and that related molecule is around 700, and one class of molecules activated by it are histone deacetylases important in calorie restriction known as sirtuins. Its levels control the rate of glycolytic enzymes and the Krebs cycle as a general indicator of redox states in the cell. Its reduced form is good for ten electrons in the electron transport chain.

answer: {principal} quantum number [or n before read; accept {energy level} until mentioned]

This quantity is equal to L plus one plus the number of radial nodes of the wavefunction. In one model, the square of this quantity is inversely proportional to energy with a constant of thirteen point six. Transitioning between two different values of it gives a frequency proportional to the difference between the reciprocals of the square of two different values of it, via the Rydberg formula. The azimuthal number is bounded by one minus this value, for which different values also generate the Pfund, Balmer, and Lyman series. This number determines the energy level of an orbital, and along with spin, angular momentum, and magnetic quantum numbers completely describe an electron in an orbital. For 10 points, name this quantum number symbolized n.

Philip Pickett has suggested an interpretation of this collection involving allegorical tableaux, the fifth section of which can be interpreted as Hercules's choice between Vice and Virtue. One section of this collection may have intended for a bird flageolet or for two recorders tied together to be played when this work calls for a “fiauto d'echo,” or echo flute. One solo in another part was likely written for an instrument built by Michael Mietke, and that harpsichord virtuosic solo appears in the fifth section of this work.

answer: {Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Phillip Cantor}

This man proved that a function can be represented as a unique series of trigonometric functions. Along with Bernstein, this man names a theorem stating that two sets are equinumerous if each is equinumerous to a subset of the other. This man showed that there is a bijection between the points of the unit segment and all the points of an n- dimensional space. His namesake theorem states that the cardinality of a set is less than that of its power set. He introduced the idea that there are no sets with cardinalities between those of the naturals and the reals, the continuum hypothesis. For 10 points, name this German-born mathematician who used a diagonal argument to prove the uncountability of the reals.

A common way to analyze these substances is Epton's two-phase titration method. For high temperatures and pressures, their effects can be measured by a captive drop method. By including diffusion, Morris et al. expanded on the a model for these substances using pulsating bubble systems; that computational model of them is named for Otis. SP-A is the most common protein with this characteristic and is used in the immune system, and DPPC is the active part of another biological type.
