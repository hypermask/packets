One poem by this author describes a wall inscribed with the phrase “PARAS THIRTEEN, BOGSIDE NIL” and is an elegy for a man who “drank like a fish” before he was “blown to bits.” He included the image of a “four foot box, a foot for every year” in a poem narrated by a student who “sat all morning in the college sick bay counting bells knelling classes to a close.” This author of “Casualty” wrote of a student of Miss Walls who collects “jampotfulls” of (*) “frogspawn” in another poem. He wrote that “my squat pen rests” “between my finger and my thumb” in a poem that compares his profession to his father's labor in the bogs. For 10 points, name this poet who included “Mid-Term Break” and “Digging” in his collection The Death of a Naturalist, an Irish Nobel winner who translated Beowulf.

answer: {archaea}

One model organism of this type produces four forms of rhodopsin, including one used to create a proton gradient for ATP synthesis. Another organism of this type uses 2-oxoacid ferredoxin oxidoreductase in place of its missing alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase gene, allowing it to carry out aerobic reactions. That species is Aeropyrum pernix. One group of these organisms uses either acetate or hydrogen as a source of energy, producing a major source of marsh gas as output. Their cell membranes often contain (*) ether-linked lipids and their cell walls lack peptidoglycan. For 10 points, name this domain of organisms which includes methanogens and many extremophiles, which are more closely related to eukaryotes than bacteria.

One thinker from this country published a rebuttal of Mandeville's fable of the bees and attacked Hobbes in his essay Thoughts of Laughter after establishing an influential ethical philosophy in An Inquiry Concerning Moral Good and Evil. Another thinker from this country advocated “direct realism” in attacking the idealism of Berkeley and championed the “vulgar” or the “sensus communis.” Another philosopher from this country proposed that each person is made up of a “bundle” of attributes and argued that although it is necessary in everyday life, a justification of (*) induction is impossible. That philosopher's criticism of those who offer prescriptive instead of descriptive theories is called the “is-ought” problem and found in his A Treatise of Human Nature.

answer: 24 {Caprices} for Solo Violin [or {Paganini's Caprices}]

A technique known as ricochet is required for several of these pieces, many of which call for the extensive use of a drone note. Dedicated “to the artists,” some were transcribed by Robert Schumann, who wrote accompaniments to all of them. They are not Beethoven's piano sonatas, but one is often called “The Hunt” (*) and imitates the flute on the high notes on horns on the low notes. A “détaché” playing style is implemented on the thirteenth of these pieces, another of which sees double-stopped sixths followed by a series of up-bow staccatos. The nickname “The Devil's Chuckle,” which adorns the thirteenth one, refers to that piece's rapid trills and its composer's apocryphal relationship with Satan. Recorded by the likes of Jascha Heifetz and Itzhak Perlman, this collection's most famous piece is its last, the subject of variations by Brahms and Rachmaninoff. For 10 points, name this group of solo violin works published by Niccoló Paganini.

Occurring under the reign of Leopold I, this battle saw the decisive charge of the (*) “Winged Hussars,” which finished off the host led by Kara Mustafa. Jan III Sobieski defeated the Ottomans in, for 10 points, what 1683 battle, which wasn't the first time the Ottomans failed to capture the capital of Austria?

Many of this policy's goals were drawn from the research of Seebohm Rowntree, who isn't Henry George, but published a study named Progress and Poverty. The economist Arthur Seldon argued heavily against this policy, whose name was coined by William Temple. Asa Briggs outlined three of its main goals in a 1967 article, and Richard Titmuss wrote a series of essays about it. Gunnar Myrdal analyzed "Economic planning and its international implications" in a book titled for going beyond this policy. It was outlined in a paper that delineated five (*) "great evils" in society, which were squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease. Including the Butler Act and the formation of the National Health Service, it arose during the tenure of Prime Minister Clement Attlee.

answer: {factorial}

The sum of the squares of the reciprocals of this function evaluated at the nonnegative integers is equal to the modified Bessel function of the first kind at x=2. The Leviathan Number is found by evaluating this function at 10 to the 666th power. The rising type can be represented with the Pochhammer Symbol. Wilson's Theorem states that this function of any prime minus 1 is also congruent to -1 modulo that prime. Legendre's theorem provides a corollary to determine the number of (*) trailing zeroes of this function evaluated at nonnegative integers. When this function is evaluated at large numbers, Stirling's approximation is used. The gamma function extends this function to all complex numbers other than negative integers. For 10 points, name this function that, for positive integers n, is the product from 1 to n, and which is represented by an exclamation point.

answer: {Romanian} language [or {Româna}]

This tongue has direct and the oblique cases, and, unlike its related languages, maintains a long o/short u distinction. The future tense in this language is invoked by compounding the verb meaning "to wish," "a vrea." This language's verb for "to preserve," "a p?stra," is the source of its sole loanword into English, "pastrami." Its endangered dialects include the Megleno- and Istro- versions. The most popular regional varieties of this language are the Aro- and Daco- forms. It is identical to a language known for nationalist reasons as (*) "Moldovan" and, due to its geographic distribution, exhibits a high degree of borrowed vocabulary from Slavic tongues.

He painted portraits of Diana Sackville and his possible mistress, the courtesan Kitty Fisher, in addition to a rather effeminate looking Banastre Tarleton. One of his best-known paintings shows Colonel Acland and Lord Sydney hunting with bows, and another contains figures of pity and terror in the background as well as the artist' signature on the hem of the main subject's dress.

answer: {Clausius}-{Clapeyron} equation

A study of the planet HD209548b involved the use of this equation to model the planet's clouds. The model predicted by this equation changes slightly between particles having an attractive Yukawa potential. This equation can model the equilibrium between (*) water vapor and a hydrated compound. It is derived from a similarly named equation that relates pressure to temperature, volume, and latent heat. In essence, solving this equation will yield the coexistence curve for two states of a substance. Its simplest form states that delta P over delta T equals L over T delta V. For 10 points, name this doubly eponymous equation, which demonstrates a nonlinear relationship between the temperature and vapor pressure of a system.
