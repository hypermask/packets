answer: {cholesterol}

HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of this compound. Steps in its formation include the production of mevalonate, which is converted to activated isoprenes. Those isoprenes are condensed into squalene, which is then cyclized to form this compound. Mineralocorticoid hormones like aldosterone are synthesized from this compound. Its concentration in the bloodstream is lowered by (*) statins. This molecule maintains the fluidity of the plasma membrane at low temperatures. High concentrations of this compound in bile lead to gall stones. When this molecule is deposited in blood vessels, the resulting narrowing and hardening of their walls is called atherosclerosis. For 10 points, name this lipid often classified as either HDL or LDL, its “good” and “bad” varieties.

answer: {Alzheimer's} disease [prompt on “{AD}”]

The disruption of trkA signalling early in this disease leads to denervation of the cerebral microvascular system and the degradation of efferent projections from the basal forebrain. One form of this disease has been linked to mutations in the presenilin-1 gene. Other genetic risk factors include the ApoE4 allele. Hyperphosphorylation of a protein that normally stabilizes microtubules, (*) tau, leads to the development of neurofibrillary tangles in this disease, which is also characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques.
