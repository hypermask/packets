answer: {G} proteins

One of these proteins stimulates the development of membrane ruffles in fibroblasts, and their activity is blocked by arrestins. The conformational change occuring when rhodopsin is struck by a photon activates one protein of this type, known as transducin. Formation of the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate from PIP2 is catalyzed by (*) phospholipase C, an enzyme activated by the a-q subunit of these proteins. They may be classified as either heterotrimeric or small, like those in the Ras superfamily. These proteins are coupled to serpentine receptors, which have seven transmembrane domains and often activate adenylate cyclase, stimulating production of cyclic AMP. For 10 points, identify this class of protein highly involved in signal transduction, named for its binding of guanine-containing compounds.

answer: Sergei Sergeyevich {Prokofiev}

One work by this man is often paired with Shostakovich's Cello Concerto No. 1 as both are considered among the most difficult cello pieces and dedicated to Rostropovich. This composer of an orchestral Sinfonia Concertante based his fourth symphony on the music from his ballet The Prodigal Son. He set out to imitate Joseph Haydn in his first symphony, terming it the “Classical.” He included a (*) “troika” movement in a film score for a film about the invented Lieutenant Kije. Another of his compositions accompanies a spoken narrative with a flute representing a bird and an oboe representing a duck. For 10 points, name this Russian composer of Peter and the Wolf.

answer: {Henry Brooks Adams} [prompt on “{Adams}”]

This thinker defined “force” as something that produces work and “progress” as “the development and economy of forces” in postulating a “dynamic theory of history.” He coupled this with a theory about the exponential increase in civilization's technological proficiency he termed the “law of acceleration.” One of his theories was prompted by his time wandering through the intense heat at the (*) Paris Exposition of 1900. That theory holds that attractive force of the medieval Catholic Church produces more unity than the current many faceted world of technology. This thinker probed some of these ideas in his book Mont Saint Michel and Chartres but exposed them directly in the chapter The Dynamo and the Virgin. For 10 points, name this American author of an autobiographical “education,” the grandson of the second president.

answer: {flux}

For the Poynting vector, this quantity gives the electromagnetic power. Given by the double integral of a density vector field dotted to a normal vector of a surface, the divergence theorem has this equal to a volume integral while Stoke's theorem equates it with a line integral. For a closed surface, the total amount of one form of this equal to zero and the negative time change in that form of this quantity is equal to the emf. The (*) magnetic and electric forms of this quantity are essential in Faraday's law and both Gauss' laws. For 10 points, name this quantity, which in electromagnetism is thought of as the total number of field lines that pass through a given region.

The Russians called this country the Transcapian Province and were opposed at an unsuccessful 1916 revolt in Tejen. As a republic, this country's first president spent over six billion dollars on the massive manmade “Golden Age Lake.” That president also made his autobiographical epic called the Rukhnama required reading.

The opening stage directions for this play describe “an alarm clock lying on its face” and “a crimson bowl in which a floating votive light is burning.” The passage of one hour is signified by the momentary lowering of a curtain in this play's third act, during which one character takes a suit from a chair belonging to the protagonist, who loses a gramophone when Mrs. Madigan comes to collect three pounds. One character's brother is shot in the hip for fighting against the (*) Free State. This play includes a refrain of “a principle's a principle,” spoken by a character who is impregnated by Charlie Bentham and pursued by Jerry Devine. One title character of this play complains that when her husband hangs out with Joxer, he “struts around” like the title animal. For 10 points, identify this play about the Boyle family, set in Ireland in the 1920s, and written by Sean O'Casey.

answer: {Conservative} Judaism [or Masorti before mentioned]

The leader of the British branch of this denomination was passed over for a position after authoring We Have Reason to Believe in a scandal known as the Jacob's Affair. This group was strengthened though its opposition to the Pittsburgh Platform, which was one of the reasons for the founding of the JTS. One of the immediate sparks for the founding of this movement was an alleged “catering error” at the “Trefa Banquet,” and it is governed internationally by the Masorti Olami. This movement split in 1963 when (*) Mordecai Kaplan founded the Reconstructionist movement. It was an extension of Zecharias Frankel's Positive-Historical Judaism, which proposed keeping traditions and laws but being open to reinterpreting them. For 10 points, name this rival of the Reform movement.

answer: Joseph-Louis {Lagrange}

This man, along with Burmann, names a formula that gives a Taylor expansion of an inverse function of an analytic function. This man's identity allows one to prove the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality via the squares of real numbers being positive. He also names a theorem stating that every positive integer can be written as a sum of at most four squares. Another theorem named for him states that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of a group. With Euler, he names a differential equation fundamental to the (*) calculus of variations, and his name is given to the remainder term in a Taylor Expansion. He further lends his name to quantities useful in finding extrema of multivariate functions under certain constraints; those quantities are denoted by lambda. For ten points, name this French polymath known for his multipliers.
