answer: Indra

Krishna once convinced Nanda to call off a puja meant for this god, and had to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavana from this god's wrath by holding up Govardhan Hill. This god once hid in the stalk of a lotus plant, emerging to save his wife Sachi from the usurper Nahusa, and he disrupted the penances of Vishvamitra by sending an Apsara to distract the sage. His servants are the Maruts, and he was the second god invoked by Kunti, leading to the birth of (*) Arjuna. He tricked Ahalya into sleeping with him, but was caught by her husband, Gautama Maharishi, whose curse caused vaginas to cover this god's body. This god's weapon is Vajra, which he used to slay the dragon Vritra. He rides Airavata, a white elephant, and carries a thunderbolt. For 10 points, identify this king of the Vedic demigods, the Hindu god of war, storms, and rain.

answer: {photons}

This particle results from the gauge symmetry of the complex numbers. In Doppler cooling, this particle is shot from two directions at atoms. The Stark-Einstein law states that one molecule reacts with exactly one of these. In the Mossbauer effect, these bosons cause no recoil in solids. This spinless particle is the force carrier for the (*) electromagnetic force and the annihilation of an electron and positron results in two of these. This massless particle has momentum equal to h-bar times the wave vector and can generate current when they hit certain metals in an effect first found by Hertz. For 10 points, name this particle representing quanta of light.

answer: {Krebs cycle} [or {tricarboxylic acid cycle} or {citric acid cycle}]

Fluoroacetate is a potent toxin because one of its metabolites blocks an important enzyme in this pathway. One of its intermediates is a precursor for both aminolevulinate and eventually porphyrins. The molecules consumed in this pathway are replenished by anaplerotic reactions. This process results in the reduction of one molecule of ubiquinone via an (*) FADH2 intermediary, and its only membrane-bound step is the conversion of succinate to fumarate. This process occurs within the mitochondrial matrix, and is followed by oxidative phosphorylation.
