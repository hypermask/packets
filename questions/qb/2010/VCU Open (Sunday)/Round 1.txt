answer: {Empire} State Building

A history by Mitchell Pacelle details Hideki Yokoi's obsession with buying this building, including his betrayal by his daughter and the legal battle between Leona Helmsley and Donald Trump over it. This building is unusual because all four of its facades are visible from the street. It was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, who originally intended its (*) spire to serve as a mooring mast for airships. In 1945, a B-25 crashed into this building on a foggy day. With the backing of Al Smith, it surpassed 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building in an intense race for the title of world's tallest building, a record it would hold for over thirty years.

answer: Saint {Nicholas}

In one story about this man, he returns the young Basilios to his parents after he had been kidnapped by Arab pirates and turned into a cupbearer for the emperor. Many depictions of this figure include a tub containing three boys, a reference to a popular story in which he dreams that an innkeeper had killed those boys and intercedes with God to bring them back to life. This saint is often seen with three golden balls, an allusion to the story in which he appears three nights in a row to give a poor man (*) dowries so that his daughters could marry. That story about this Bishop of Myra and patron saint of sailors and children led to a tradition involving gifts and chimneys. For 10 points, name this Catholic saint.

answer: {Snell's} law

Combined with Cauchy's equation, this equation implies material dispersion. For calcium carbonate, the o-ray follows this equation, but the e-ray does not. While birefringence can result in violation of this law, by setting the time derivative of path length to zero, (*) Fermat's principle of least time can be used to derive this equation. It can be used to calculate the angle where, instead of passing through, light is reflected off the boundary of the two mediums.  Light entering at that critical angle undergoes total internal reflection. For 10 points, name this equation that states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence is proportional to the reciprocal ratio of the indices of refraction.

answer: {nephrons}

One region within these structures contains modified smooth muscle cells called mesangial cells and octopus-like epithelial cells with many extensions, known as podocytes. Mammals and birds possess a deeply extending type of these structures which are surrounded by long capillaries called the vasa recta. A- and B-type natriuretic peptides act on a tightly packed region of cells within these structures, the (*) macula densa. Extra aquaporins are inserted into the distal portion of these structures in response to vasopressin, increasing their resorption of water. Renin is secreted by their juxtaglomerular apparatus. For 10 points, identify these structures comprised of subunits including the proximal and distal tubules, the glomerulus, and Bowman's capsule, the smallest functional unit of the kidney.

answer: {Dirac Delta} function

It was originally used to describe a wave function in momentum space for a wave with definite momentum. The integral from -1 to 1 of this function of 1 over x is zero. An infinite series of evenly spaced ones is called a (*) comb, and the Fourier transform of that construct is another comb. The convolution of a function with this one simply yields the original function.  It was first rigorously defined mathematically by Laurent Schwartz. The integral of a function “f” multiplied by this function centered at point “a” is f(a) (“f of a”), and it is the derivative of a step function named after Heaviside. For 10 points, name this “improper” function with zero width, infinite height, and area one, often used to describe a sharp impulse.

answer: {calcium} ions [accept {Ca2+} or {Ca++}]

This substance binds to synaptotagmin to stimulate the SNARE-mediated fusion of synaptic vesicles to the cell membrane.  Along with heat, bacterial cells are treated with its chloride to make them competent, allowing the uptake of free plasmids.  In the slow mechanism for blocking polyspermy of sea urchins, the fusion of the first sperm triggers an increase in cytoplasmic concentrations of this (*) ion that allows the vitelline layer to block subsequent sperm.  It causes a conformational change in troponin C after this ion is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, opening up binding sites on myosin. For 10 points, name this ion important in muscle contraction which, which along with phosphate ions, forms hydroxyapatite, the primary mineral in bone.
