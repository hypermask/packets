answer: {linear momentum} [prompt on {p}; do not accept "{angular momentum}"]

Noether's theorem implies that because of space translation symmetry, this quantity is conserved. In relativity, a massless particle's energy is equal to this multiplied by the speed of light. This quantity can also be found by dividing Planck's constant by the de Broglie wavelength. At non-relativistic speeds, this quantity squared divided by two times the mass gives the kinetic energy. The change in this quantity is called the (*) impulse. Newton's second law states that force is proportional to the time derivative of this quantity. For 10 points, name this quantity that can be found as the product of mass and velocity and is often denoted p.

Types of these events are differentiated by determining whether their spectra exhibit the Balmer series. Some of these events are candidates for the r-process, which creates heavy elements. Another type of this event is initiated when a white dwarf accretes enough matter to undergo carbon-carbon fusion, yet another occurs when a nickel-iron core starts building up and exceeds the Chandreshekar limit, which leads to core collapse until it is stopped by (*) electron degeneracy pressure. The energy then rebounds, creating this event. These events are differentiated into the Type I and Type II varieties, respectively. For 10 points, name this giant stellar explosion.

answer: {viscosity}

One method to measure this property uses spring plates which are vibrated at uniform amplitude and frequency. The energy input is then measured. The classical method to measure this quantity uses a capillary tube, and is named after (*) Stokes. This quantity is almost independent of pressure and density in gases, but increases with temperature; in liquids, however, it decreases as temperature increases. This quantity can be calculated using Newton's equation describing fluid motion, and its kinematic version is equal to the dynamic version divided by the density. It is given by the ratio of shear stress to the velocity gradient.  For 10 points, name this property of a fluid measured in units of poise, the resistance of a fluid to flow.
