answer: {Integration} [or Finding a {Definite Integral}; accept {Finding} the {Antiderivative} before the end]

Pettis formulated a way to do this operation on Banach Spaces that's often more useful than Dunford's method; that operation is sometimes called the weak form of this.  For the “microscopic circulation” of a two-dimensional vector field, this operation for a particular region along a closed curve equals the total circulation of that field around the curve according to Green's Theorem.  Doing this with a construct named for Darboux yields the same results as using an entity named for Stieltjes.  Trigonometric functions are written in form of e^ix or e^-ix when performing this process with (*) Euler's Formula.  In one method for doing this, preference is given to Logarithmic and Inverse Logarithmic functions via the LIATE rule and that method works similar to its inverse operation's product rule.  The ratio of 3/8ths is sometimes used in one method for doing this, which is more accurate than using trapezoids.  This operation can be approximated with Simpson's Method and can also be done by parts.  For 10 points, name this operation, the opposite of finding the derivative.
