One application of this equation is used in speedometers of planes, called pitot-static [pih-toh] tubes. One law that can be derived from this equation states that the velocity is equal to the square root of twice the product of gravity and height, called Torricelli's law. It can be used to derive why the pressure drops in a constricted section of a pipe, called the (*) Venturi effect. This equation and Newton's laws of motion can be used to explain aerodynamic forces like lift on an airplane. A consequence of this equation is that when the velocity of a liquid is faster, the pressure is lower. For 10 points, name this equation named for a Dutch-Swiss mathematician.
