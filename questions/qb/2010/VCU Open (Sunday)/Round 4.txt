answer: Vitamin {A}

Overconsumption of this nutrient has been linked to long-term decreases in bone density and increased intracranial pressure. All forms of this nutrient contain an identical structural motif, a beta-ionone attached to an isoprenoid chain. This nutrient has a carboxylic acid metabolite that maintains (*) skin integrity and acts to transcribe certain genes. This nutrient's most famous function, however, is mediated by another form, which binds to opsin and isomerizes upon stimulation by light. For ten points, name this essential fat-soluble nutrient, plentiful in both the liver and carrots, whose deficiency causes night blindness.

Both the reverse-delete algorithm and its inverse, Kruskal's algorithm, can be used to find one of these objects with the cut property, whose edges have a minimum total weight. These structures are undirected graphs which are also connected and acyclic. One of these structures invented by Adelson-Velskii and Landis is self-balancing, and is closely related to another type defined by alternating nodes of two (*) namesake colors, red and black. Heaps are considered a specialized binary type of this object, and internal connection points within them are known as forks.

The genes coding for these molecules are purposefully mutated in a process called somatic hypermutation, and they sometimes undergo isotype switching. In a process discovered by Susumu Tonegawa, they are assembled by random selection of variable region, diversity, and joining segments, called V(D)J recombination. Both the nonspecific and specific type of these molecules are used in (*) ELISA. They enhance phagocytosis in a process called opsonization, and activate the binding of proteins C1 through C9 in the complement cascade. They fall into five major classes: G, A, M, D, and E. For 10 points, identify these bivalent Y-shaped proteins consisting of two light and two heavy chains, which recognize the epitopes of specific pathogens.

answer: {capacitance}

The quantum version of this quantity is equal to electron charge squared times the density of states at the Fermi energy and is used to describe two dimensional electron gases. For a concentric sphere with opposing charges on the spheres, this quantity is derived by first using Gauss's law to find the Electric Field between the spheres. Eventually, that method gives a value of 4 pi times the product of the two radii divided by the difference of those two radii for the concentric sphere. In (*) series, it is calculated as the harmonic sum of the individual values of this quantity, while in parallel, this quantity is additive. It is often calculated by dividing charge by voltage. For 10 points, name this quantity measured in farads, defined as the ability to store electrical charge.
