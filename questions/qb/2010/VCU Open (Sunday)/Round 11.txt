answer: {Doolittle Raid}

The orchestrator of this operation claimed Fort Worth Star-Telegram editor Amon Carter originated the idea for it in his memoirs I Could Never Be So Lucky Again. This action sparked the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign after one side's survivors were helped by John Birch and others. One craft that took part in this event was “The Ruptured Duck,” which was piloted by Ted Lawson, whose book about it inspired a (*) Spencer Tracy movie. The planes involved in this operation were stripped down and given double the fuel capacity, allowing them to take off from the USS Hornet and return to China. For 10 points, name this US propaganda victory in which the Air Force bombed the Japanese Home Islands in 1942.

This artist gave his doctor a roundel in which a haloed Mary leans into a railing while holding an infant Christ. He sculpted putti blowing horns and celebrating around a severed head in the bas relief of the pedestal of his sculpture Judith and Holofernes. This artist of the “Chellini Madonna” has another of his sculptures housed inside a niche made by Perfetto di Giovanni and Albizzo di Pietro; that sculpture of (*) St. Mark was initially rejected by a linen guild and rests outside the Orsanmichele. He brought back the genre of life-size equestrians with his depiction of Erasmo of Narni titled Gattamelata, and he sculpted another man holding a sword and standing on Goliath's head. For 10 points, name this Italian Renaissance sculptor known for his bronze effeminate David.

answer: The {Birthday Party}

After one character in this play's first act says “succulent,” the other replies “you shouldn't say that word to a married woman.” One character is calmed by another blowing into his mouth, though that same character agitates him by calling him “Simey” and keeps tearing newspapers into five equal strips. One character believes another character to be asleep, though he was taken away to see (*) “Monty” for “special treatment.” That character beats a drum around a room before removing his glasses and being backed up against the wall during a game of blindman's bluff, during which he attempts to rape a woman. The other woman proclaims herself to be the “belle of the ball,” an event during which Petey is absent and which was thrown together by Goldberg and McCann. For 10 points, identify this play about the boarder Stanley, who ages one year in a violent and absurd spectacle, the first-full length play by Harold Pinter.

Practitioners of this religion believe that the only two unforgivable sins are murder and blasphemy. They also believe in the existence of the Telestial, Terrestrial, and Celestial Kingdoms, three levels of heavens where all except the “sons of perdition” go after death. All boys who practice this religion enter the Aaronic priesthood at the age of twelve by becoming deacons, and the other branch of its priesthood has ranks called elder, seventy, and high priest and is termed the “Melchizedek” order. One holy book of this religion was written in (*) “reformed Egyptian” and was affirmed by the Testimonies of the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses, who confirmed that the angel Moroni had revealed the location of golden plates to Joseph Smith. For 10 points, name this religion of Brigham Young.

answer: quantum {tunneling}

The DC Josephson effect occurs because of this effect. This effect is used in STMs, which are a type of microscopes. Calculating the probability of this happening for a Heaviside step function requires using the boundary conditions that the wavefunction and its derivative have to be continuous everywhere. The probability of this happening has a hyperbolic sine squared in its denominator and this was used to explain (*) alpha decay as protons would need a large amount of energy to leave the nucleus. This effect happens when a potential barrier is greater than the energy of a moving particle and the particle moves through the barrier. For 10 points, name this quantum mechanical effect.

answer: {ferns} [accept {pteridophytes} prior to mention]

Related organisms to this division possess non-photosynthetic leaves containing a characteristic vascular trace. Some species in this division benefit from an umbrella-like covering provided by a thin film of tissue called the indusium. Their gametophyte stage is called a prothallus, and as of 2006, this group includes the plants known as horsetails. Their namesake “great radiation” occurred in the Cretaceous, though they first appeared in the fossil record around the Carboniferous period. They are more complex than the (*) lycophytes because they possess true leaves, known as fronds. For 10 points, name this division of seedless vascular plants, also called Pteridophyta.

answer: {RSA} cryptography or algorithm or {cryptosystem} [or {Rivest}, {Shamir}, {Adleman}]

One strategy in implementing this is using a number with a small Hamming weight, such as 3 or 17, in order to optimize the amount of modular multiplications; that number is usually denoted e. It also makes use of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a number denoted d, which is congruent to e raised to the negative first power modulus phi, where phi denotes the (*) totient function of the distinct integers p and q. The greatest common divisor of e and phi is 1, meaning that those two numbers are coprime, and phi ends up being equal to (p-1)(q-1) [p minus 1 times q minus 1] since both p and q are prime numbers. Based heavily on Fermat's Little Theorem, this system often makes use of a signature system and uses e and d in its public and private keys, respectively. Relying on the fact that large integers are difficult to factor, this is, for 10 points, what popular cryptography algorithm which is named after its three developers?

answer: Franz Ritter von {Liszt} [or {Ferencz Liszt}]

This composer added nine bars as a coda to the third version of his piece "Au bord d'une source." The first edition of that work joined "La Valée d'Obermann" and "Chapelle de Guillaume Tell" in three books of twelve travel-related pieces. After another composer dedicated his "Fantasia in C" to him, this composer reciprocated by writing a work with five motifs and an incorporation of four movements seamlessly into one. Thematically similar to that Piano Sonata in B minor is a symphony he wrote with an A flat major second movement containing a clarinet-violin dialogue representing a game of "he loves me, he loves me not," followed by a nigh-atonal movement in which the "Spirit of Negation" is driven away by (*) Gretchen's innocence. One collection of his works includes "The Dance in the Village Inn" and sometimes the Bagatelle sans tonalité, and another ends with "Chase-Naige" and includes "Mazeppa" and "Feux Follets." For 10 points, identify this composer of the Faust Symphony, Mephisto Waltzes, and Transcendental Etudes.

answer: {Middle English} [do not accept or prompt on "{Old English}" or "{English}"]

Evidence of female literacy in this language is contained in such corpora as the Wooing Group and the Katherine Group. The merging of dialects in this language caused the loss of distinction between the present participle and the gerund, while the lengthening of first-syllable vowels in words composed of two short syllables led to the muting of final "e." This language's writing system included an all-purpose character for velar sounds, which resembles a cursive "z" and is called "yogh." This language existed for most of its lifespan alongside (*) French and Latin, and became the sole tongue during the transition to its successor, the "Early Modern" phase. Perhaps the most well-known text in this language begins "Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote." For 10 points, identify this language, which flourished from around 1070 to 1500 in the British Isles.

Helium-3 and Boron-10 are sometimes used to detect this particle. Bothe and Becker's experimentation with beryllium thought that these particles were at first gamma rays. Discovered by James Chadwick, it was later found to be composed of two down quarks and one up quark. When these particles are not bound, they undergo beta decay, emitting a(*) proton, an electron, and an antineutrino, with a mean lifetime of around fifteen minutes. Uranium 235 undergoes fission when one of these particles strikes it, which produces three more of these particles. While carbon 12 has only six of them, carbon 14 has 8 of them. For 10 points, name this subatomic particle that has around the same mass as a proton but has no charge.
