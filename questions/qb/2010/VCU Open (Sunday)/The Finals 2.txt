answer: {superfluid}

Feynman used path integrals to map a quantum system onto “polymers” to create a model of these entities. One article studied the transition of one of these into a substance that does not conduct electricity despite classical predictions, called a Mott insulator. When rotating around a point, it can only move in whole number multiples of a minimum velocity, a property known as quantized vortices. All atoms of a material in this phase occupy the (*) same quantum state, and materials of this type can flow over the walls of a beaker without an external start to their motion. For 10 points, name this state in which a substance loses all viscosity, notably reached by helium near 2 Kelvin.

answer: RNA {splicing}

In the laboratory, morpholinos may be used to block translation or modify this process. EJC proteins are deposited about 20 nucleotides upstream of the site where it occurs, allowing errors in this process to be corrected via nonsense-mediated decay. In group I, guanosine acts as a cofactor for the first of two transesterification reactions, while in another version of this process, an adenine residue at the (*) branch point links to the 5-prime end of a cut mRNA segment, forming a characteristic loop called a lariat. This is facilitated by the action of several short uridine-rich compounds called snRNPs ("snurps"). It is self-catalyzed by ribozymes, and protein isoforms arise due to its alternative type. For 10 points, identify this process in which an mRNA transcript is modified by the removal of introns.

answer: {eutrophication} [prompt on {spring bloom} or {algal bloom} until “{anthropogenic}”]

The extent of this phenomenon can be measured by Carlson's index, and its primary symptoms include increased levels of chlorophyll a and the presence of epiphytes. It decreases both the amount of light penetrating to lower levels, and the oxygen content on the bed of a body of water. The anthropogenic form of this phenomenon, which has caused the proliferation of (*) duckweed within Lake Maracaibo, results due to runoff from sewage and fertilizers. It causes an increase in primary productivity, and the dominance of cyanobacteria frequently indicates this process. For 10 points, identify this process in which the concentration of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus within a body of water increases over time, which often leads to algal blooms.

Anthony Payne completed his unfinished third symphony, despite this composer's dying wish that no one “tinker” with it. His first symphony is the most commonly performed one, in A-flat major, and this composer intended his Introduction and Allegro as a pure display of virtuosity. He used musical (*) cryptograms in a piece dedicated to “my friends pictured within.” The first march of another of his works provides the music for the song “Land of Hope and Glory.” For 10 points, name this English composer of The Enigma Variations and The Pomp and Circumstance Marches.
