answer: {quasi}-{stellar} radio {sources} [or {Quasi}-{Stellar} Objects; or {quasars}]

Some of these objects have gaps in their ultraviolet spectrum due to the existence of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium,  providing evidence for the reionization of hydrogen around z = 6. Gravitational lensing was first confirmed by a twin of these. These objects can have redshifts greater than 5.8, which is where the (*) Gunn-Peterson trough is observed. Their variability suggests they are compact, of a size on the order of light-weeks or months. These objects are powered by accretion disks around supermassive black holes. For 10 points, name these remnants of the early universe which emit as much energy as some galaxies, are the most luminous objects in the universe, and are composed mostly of “radio quiet” types.

answer: {IR Spectroscopy}

Especially good solvents for this procedure include carbon disulfide and carbon tetrachloride, though both are highly toxic. For testing coatings and powders, this technique can be used with attenuated total reflectance. Liquids are placed between two salt plates as preparation for this technique, while solid compounds are ground in combination with (*) potassium bromide and pressed into a thin disc. This technique relies on stimulating the vibrational modes of molecules. The output from this technique is a plot of transmittance versus wavenumber in inverse centimeters and includes a “fingerprint” for each molecule. For 10 points, name this common lab technique for identifying functional groups in molecules using radiation wavelengths just longer than visible light.
