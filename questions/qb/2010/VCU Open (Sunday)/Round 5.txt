After studying sculpture in Vienna under Fritz Wotruba, this artist moved to Paris where he closed down the Rue Visconti in order to display his work Iron Curtain. An associate of the photographer Wolgang Volz, he is also known for such works as the multi-colored The Wall and the sausage-shaped Air Package. Worker Masaaki Nakamura was electrocuted (*) while trying to remove one of the 3,000 blue or yellow title objects comprising one of this artist's works, while another of his works was over 24 miles in length and was contained within two California counties. Pink polypropylene surrounded eleven islands in Florida's Biscayne Bay in a 1983 project, while in 1995 he applied his technique of “empaquetage” to the Reichstag in Berlin. This creator of Umbrellas and Running Fence requested that no flowers be sent after the death of his wife Jean-Claude, whose last completed project was a series of orange structures in Central Park. For 10 points, name this Bulgarian-born artist best known for wrapping various objects and designing The Gates project.

answer: {ammonia}

Tests for this compound and its salts include Nessler's solution and burning sulfur sticks. This chemical was first used to solvate electrons of alkali metals, producing brightly colored solutions.  When Tollens' reagent is prepared for laboratory use, a solution containing this chemical is used to dissolve a precipitate of silver-1 oxide. It is combined with (*) oxygen to produce nitric acid in the Ostwald process, and in humans, this chemical is converted into urea for excretion. One method of producing this chemical uses methane to synthesize hydrogen gas which is then reacted with nitrogen over an iron catalyst, and is called the Haber-Bosch process. For 10 points, name this chemical with formula NH3.

answer: Friedrich {Schiller}

The title character of one of this author's poems is forsaken to die alone because "However far his voice he sends, / Naught living to his cry attends," while he wrote about a "bond of truth that ne'er decays" in a poem that claims that, though bees and worms may be proficient in their crafts, "man, alone hast art." This author of "The Cranes of Ibycus" and "The Artists" wrote that "Joy be she this city bringing, / Peace be the first chime she's ringing" in his poem "The (*) Song of the Bell." He is better known for a poem that importunes the "courageous millions" to "Suffer for a better world" because the title concept will smile on the searcher of "truth's own fiery mirror" and will coax "Flowers from the buds." Also the writer of plays such as The Bride of Messina and The Robbers, for 10 points, name this German poet of "Ode to Joy."

One theorem named after this man states that an infinite series which converges only because it contains both positive and negative numbers can have its terms rearranged so that it sums to any given value. Another theorem named after this man concerns the placement of areas in the complex plane onto unit disks, and is known as his mapping theorem. He gave a famous lecture on geometry in order to earn a position in which he introduced his namesake (*) manifold. More famously, he studied a function which is the infinite sum of n to the negative s, where s can be any complex value, and hypothesized that the nontrivial zeros of that function all have real part one half. For 10 points, name this mathematician who gives his name to a method to approximating an integral using a sum of rectangles and a zeta function.

One commander at this battle said that all his battalions charged at least four times during the battle. The prelude to this battle consisted of crafty maneuvering down the Rhine by the British, away from the Dutch and toward the forces of Marshal Tallard and the Elector of Bavaria. The major mistake of the losing side was the excessive requisitioning of troops into the namesake city. (*) Eugene of Savoy commanded one wing of the Allies and John Churchill commanded the wing. For ten points, name this battle, that saved Vienna from being taken by the Franco-Bavarian army, the turning point of the War of Spanish Succession.

The original cover art of this text displayed ten small images of military weaponry and prowess.  They accompanied the main picture of a giant man wearing a crown and holding a sword and a torch, looking over a village from the hills that would otherwise have been in the background.  That original cover for this work was created by Abraham Bosse. This work's third section expresses the sentiment that no one's word can be taken as divine, though it notably says that sentiment is not true in the case of the scriptures. Its fourth section, "The Kingdom of (*) Darkness," discusses various types of ignorance, while it postulates aristocracy, monarchy, and democracy in its second section, "Of Common-wealth." Arguing for the absolute power of rulers and proclaiming that life is "nasty, brutish, and short," for 10 points, name this work of Thomas Hobbes.

answer: {telomeres}

These structures resolve a problem first recognized by Alexei Olovnikov, although they are not necessary in most bacteriophages and bacteria. Their namesake enzyme was first discovered in Tetrahymena. That enzyme is a ribonucleoprotein which carries out reverse transcription to add several repeats of a six-nucleotide sequence, (*) TTAGGG. Hydrogen bonding between those guanine residues creates a hairpin structure, which enables the rest of the lagging strand to be filled in. Although they are extremely stable in most tumor cells, these structures gradually shorten as a normal somatic cell ages. For 10 points, name these segments of DNA which protect the ends of linear chromosomes from decay.

answer: {Compton} scattering [or {Compton} effect]

Its namesake edge is formed in gamma ray spectroscopy when a gamma ray scatters off the detector because of this effect. The Klein-Nishima formula gives the generalized formula for both this and the Thomson effect for all frequencies. The inverse of this effect can be observed when photons in the cosmic microwave background interact with hot gas near a galaxy group, known as the (*) Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The change in wavelength from this effect is equal to Planck's constant divided by the mass of an electron and the speed of light multiplied by one minus the cosine of the scattering angle. For 10 points, name this effect in which a high frequency photon loses energy when it interacts with matter, and inelastic effect named for an American scientist.

Yale's M. Keith Hall claimed the Monty Hall Effect nullified the results of an experiment in which these animals were given various colored M&M's to prove they suffer from cognitive dissonance. In a thought experiment, these animals are conditioned to attack the more ambitious members of their group with blasts of cold water. Joseph Brady shocked an “Executive” one every time it failed to press a lever, until it died of stress induced ulcers.

Some aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as kanamycin, inhibit the activity of these structures. The binding of certain molecules to their A-sites is facilitated by elongation factors; those molecules are later shifted to the E-site for removal. In bacteria, they recognize and bind to purine-only segments upstream of f-met called (*) Shine-Dalgarno sequences. The prokaryotic versions of these structures are composed of two subunits, 30S and 50S. They may be free-floating in the cytosol or membrane-bound within the endoplasmic reticulum, and they name the type of RNA most abundant in the cell. For 10 points, identify these tiny structures synthesized in the nucleolus, which produce polypeptide chains in translation.
