This event launched the career of Roger Boisjoly and resulted in an undisclosed fine for Morton Thiokol. It prompted the only ever postponement of the State of the Union speech, which was replaced by a brief address that noted the 390th anniversary of Sir Francis Drake's death. The Kerwin report noted the activation of three PEAPs during this event, and it prompted a congressional hearing which saw (*) Rogers Commission member Richard Feynman use a glass of ice water to demonstrate flaws in the O-ring.

answer: {seafloor spreading} [or plate {tectonics} before {Morley}-{Vine}-{Matthews hypothesis}]

Conclusive evidence for this process was provided by the same vessel that found the first empirical evidence for the Messinian salinity crisis. That vessel was the Glomar Challenger. The Morley-Vine-Matthews hypothesis states that this phenomenon preserves the history of (*) reversal's in the Earth's magnetic field. Also found on Mars, that preservation results in bands of alternating magnetic polarization, known as magnetic striping. First proposed by Harry Hess, this phenomenon is caused by convection currents in the asthenosphere and explains continental drift. For 10 points, name this geologic process, typical of divergent plate boundaries, which led to the establishment of plate tectonic theory and by which new oceanic crust is formed at mid-ocean ridges.

answer: In {Memoriam A.H.H.}

This poem's line “Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky” is followed by eight stanzas of invocations to bells to “ring out” or “ring in.” This poem quotes its earlier assertion that nature is “so careful of the type” but “so careless of the single life” before marveling that man “trusted God was love indeed” even though “Nature, red in tooth and claw” has “shriek'd against his creed.” Its preface invokes “Strong Son of God, immortal Love,” and this poem's (*) one hundred and thirty one sections are composed of ABBA quatrains sometimes known as its namesake stanza. The narrator of this poem holds that “Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.” For 10 points, name this Tennyson poem written over seventeen years after the death of Arthur Henry Hallam.

A red and white object can be seen through an opening on the right side of this painting, which also depicts a green door behind a brown curtain. Four lamps, one of which does not appear to be as bright as the others, hang from the ceiling, which may have been painted green due to its artist's wishes to “express the terrible passions of humanity.” A clock reading 12:15 hangs above a table holding a vase of flowers and several bottles. Although a chatting couple can be seen in the corner (*) of the room, many of the seated figures in this painting are solemn-looking and have their heads resting on tables. In a letter to his brother Theo, its artist described the title location as a “devil's furnace,” which is evident by the red walls depicted in it. Completed around the same time as its artist's The Yellow House, this painting also depicts the owner of the title location Joseph Ginoux, who appears a man dressed in white standing next to a pool table in the center of the room.

answer: {chloroplasts}

When the organism Elysia pusilla feeds on Halimeda, it can actually incorporate these organelles into their bodies. Atrazine resistance can be introduced with a single base change to 110000 to 160000 base pair genome of this organelle. Electron microscopy of this organelle reveals alternating dark and light bands, which point to a sub-structure that itself contains antenna complexes. A study of heterokonts seems to indicate that these organelles resulted from multiple endosymbiosis of (*) cyanobacteria. One substance produced by this organelle is beta-cryptoxanthin, which can be converted to retinal much like a class of four compounds produced here called the carotenoids. This organelle contains an aqueous fluid known as stroma, along with grana stacks of thylakoid membranes. For 10 points, identify these plastids primarily found in photosynthetic organisms, which produce chlorophyll.

answer: {Michelson}-{Morley} experiment

Trout and Rankine performed a version of this experiment using a Wheatstone bridge to measure changes in resistance in a rotated circuit. This experiment was also modified by Kennedy and Thorndike, to test the length contraction hypothesis proposed by Lorentz and Fitzgerald. The original experimenters used a sodium lamp to produce a continuous beam of monochromatic light which was shot at a (*) beam splitter consisting of a half-silvered mirror. The entire apparatus of this experiment was able to be rotated relative to a hypothetical stationary reference medium, as it was constructed on a stone slab floating atop a pool of mercury. For 10 points, name this 1887 experiment with a null result which used an interferometer to disprove the concept of a luminiferous ether.

answer: electric field

Polarization density is equal to this multiplied by vacuum permittivity and electric susceptibility. The Debye length is the distance that mobile charge carriers can shield from these. The index of refraction can change due to one of these in the Kerr effect. In Faraday's law of induction, the curl of this vector is taken, while in Gauss's law the divergence of this is equal to (*) charge density divided by vacuum permittivity. This has a value of 0 outside of a capacitor and is defined as equal to the force that a test charge would feel at a given location in space. This is equal to k times charge divided by distance squared in Coulomb's law. For 10 points, name this vector that has units of newtons per coulomb.
