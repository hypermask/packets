This structure's Muller cells provide support functions including controlling potassium ion concentration within its inner plexiform layer. It contains M cells and P cells, which project to magnocellular and parvocellular sections of the lateral geniculate nucleus. In nocturnal animals, the tapetum lucidum lies immediately behind this structure, on the choroid. Interneurons within this structure include horizontal and amacrine cells, and (*) Tay-Sachs is often diagnosed by the presence of a cherry-red spot in a certain region. Its bipolar cells receive inputs from cells that hyperpolarize in response to light. This structure's region of highest sensory acuity is the fovea, which is surrounded by the macula. For 10 points, identify this inner layer of the eye, which contains rods and cones.

answer: Critique of {Pure Reason}

One section of this work offers such equally reasonable negative explanations as the absence of a beginning to time and the lack of an absolute condition for all things as “antinomies” to discredit the fields of rational psychology, rational cosmology, and natural theology. This work argues that the existence of things in space is a necessary condition for inner experience in a section added to its second edition, “The Refutation of Idealism.” This work is divided into a long section on the “Transcendental Doctrine of Method” and a shorter one on the “Transcendental Doctrine of Elements.” Its arguments were clarified in the (*) Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, and it argues that like mathematics and physics, metaphysics needs to limit itself to matters that are both a priori and synthetic. For 10 points, name this most important work of Immanuel Kant.

answer: friction

On an atomic scale, this property may be explained by either of two models in which it is mediated by phonons: the dislocation model, and one proposed by Tomlinson. It may be measured by an atomic force microscope or a tribometer. Darcy and Weisbach name a factor for determining it for fluid flow through a pipe, and this type of force is completely dominant at extremely low Reynolds numbers. According to (*) Amonton's laws, this force is independent of the apparent area of contact between two objects. It is responsible for damping oscillations, and in free fall, when this force balances an object's weight, that object falls at its terminal velocity. For 10 points, identify this non-conservative force which acts opposite to the direction of an object's motion, with a coefficient symbolized by "mu."

answer: {Der Freischütz} [accept The {Free}-{Shooter} or The {Marksman} before that word is read]

Much to the chagrin of its librettist Friedrich Kind, this opera's original opening scene, in which a hermit has a terrible vision of the future, was cut from the final version. A diminished seventh chord accompanies seven manifestations of evil in a scene taking place in the Wolf's Glen, and in this opera's first act the drinking song “Hier im ird'schen Jammerthal” is sung in order to enrage the protagonist, who wants to marry the daughter of Cuno. In Act II, Aennchen accidentally knocks down (*) a portrait, hurting a woman who dreams that she will be killed in the form of a white dove; that woman also makes a bridal wreath using a possibly-magical rose and is named Agathe. After he is defeated in a contest by the peasant Killian, the protagonist Max is shown by the forester Caspar the power of magic bullets that will allow him to win the marksman's competition the next day.

Pisano periods are concerned with repetitions in these entities, while the Gellin-Cesaro identity relates five members of this set. The divisibility of entities in this set by a prime p are related to the Legendre symbol of p over 5. According to Zeckendorf's Theorem, every positive integer can be written as a sum of one or more distinct terms in this set.
