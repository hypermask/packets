answer: Sir Hiram Stevens {Maxim}

This man's lesser known inventions included a precursor to the inhaler which used pine vapor as well as the modern mousetrap. He's not Joseph Swan, but did claim to invent the light bulb before Edison. This man then began work on a device that would be first used in the First Matabele War by the British. His namesake device was sold primarily by Basil Zarahoff after it was mass produced. Because of overheating problems, this man improved his device by adding a cylindrical water filled case that went around the barrel. That gun could fire at 600 rounds per minute because of a spring system that utilized the guns recoil in order to empty and reload the breech. For 10 points, name this American born, British inventor whose namesake machine gun was the basis of the Vickers guns used by the great powers in World War I.

answer: {Cepheid} Variables

Cecilia and Sergei Gaposchkin found that a more symmetric subset of these stars found in the Magellanic Clouds are systematically brighter than predicted, and the Baade-Wesselink Method can be used to find their size. The shortest known period of one of these stars in a binary system is 507 days in S Muscae, leading to the theory that most observed examples are on their second or high crossing of the instability strip. Metal-poor examples of these stars are called W. Virginis. A shark-fin curve represents their most distinction feature, which is caused He-plus ionizing to He-two-plus, leading to a pressure gradient and subsequent expansion. For 10 points, name this class of variable star with period longer than RR Lyrae that is often used as standard candles.

answer: {Ralph Vaughn Williams}

One suite, by this composer for viola, small chorus, and orchestra consists of six movements each labeled with a verse from the Song of Solomon, and takes its title from the Latin for “flower of the field.” In addition to Flos Campi, this composer stayed in the port town of King's Lynn for nearly three months collecting folk songs he later used in his Norfolk Rhapsody. The last movement of his third symphony opens with a pentatonic recitative for wordless soprano voice with muted percussion, and his second symphony opens with the harp sounding the chimes of Westminster. He wrote the score for the 1948 biopic, Scott in the Antarctic, much of which he reused in his seventh symphony, Sinfonia Antartica.

answer: An American {Dilemma}: The {Negro Problem} and {Modern Democracy}

This work calls the medium of plenipotentiaries through which the two central groups communicate “The Glass Plate.” The sixth section of this text's introduction offers a warning to the reader, which notes that the search for scientific knowledge depends on valuations as well as facts. It cites George Washington Cable in order to show the predominance of the “static assumption.” It notes that the central paradox presented by the “American Creed,” is partially resolved once a distinction is drawn between equality and equal opportunity, and this work articulates a vicious cycle of oppression and blame on the subtitular group described as the “principle of cumulation.” Cited in Brown vs. Board of Education and funded by the Carnegie Foundation, for 10 points, name this sociological analysis of US race relations written by Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal.

One test for this disease screens for the proteins ESAT-6 and CFP-10 emitted by the bacteria that cause disease; that method is the QuantiFERON Gold test. Drugs used in treating this disease include one which inhibits autorepressors by attaching to RNA polymerase holoenzyme and one which binds to a protein reductase known as InhA, thus blocking synthesis of mycolic acid and preventing the creation of the cell wall. Those drugs,  rifampicin and isoniazid, are part of the Directly Observed Therapy, Short Course, or DOTS, which is prescribed to treat this disease . One type of infection by this disease sees bacteria invade the circulatory system, creating seed like spots on the lungs; that version is known as the miliary form. For 10 points, name this disease caused by a mycobacterium which infects the lungs.

In a translation of this poem, J.B. Leishman included the line "His gaze...is so misted with tiredness," though he is sometimes contrasted with a more plodding translator Edward Snow who described one figure in this poem with the line "his gaze...holds nothing anymore." A translation by Leonard Cottrell describes "a noble will that stands there numb" and describes that prisoner with the line "along a nerve, awareness darts - arriving in his heart, it dies." The translation by Robert Bly describes the exhibit as "bars, a hundred thousand bars, and behind the bars, nothing." Composed at Rodin's advice after a trip to the Jardin des Plantes, for 10 points, name this Rilke poem about a big cat.

answer: {Liquidity Trap}

Eggertsson and Woodford showed that this phenomenon can be caused by central bank adherence to a Taylor Rule. The government can address this phenomenon with a ‘rules vs. discretion' dichotomy and making announcements, because this phenomenon is caused by consumers' future expectations. It can lead to deflationary pressure and in this situation consumers avoid bonds because they believe interest rates will rise. Friedman offered a solution to this problem involving helicopters, and according to the Keynesian theory, the effective interest rate of zero makes monetary policy ineffective, but this condition can be addressed by issuing debt, a process called quantitative easing. For 10 points, name this situation during the Great Depression as well as modern Japan in which institutions hoard money.

answer: Willard Van Orman {Quine}

One essay by this thinker uses the hypothetical philosophers McX and Wyman to respond to the problem of nonbeing, and also employs the example of a "round square cupola" to critique a Russellian analysis of names. This thinker defines such words as “Creation” and “Anomaly” in his “Intermittently Philosphical Dictonary” titled Quiddities. In addition to writing "On What There Is," this thinker used the example of a native uttering a foreign word “gavagai” upon seeing a rabbit to expound upon his idea of the indeterminacy of translation, a concept discussed in both Ontological Relativity and Word and Object. For 10 points, name this philosopher who aimed to eliminate the distinction between analytic and synthetic truths of logical positivism in his "Two Dogmas of Empiricism."

answer: {Entropy} [accept {S}]

A formulation of this quantity due to Kolmogorov is derived by dividing phase space into infinitesimal hypercubes and is equal to an integral of the Lyapunov exponent over possible trajectories. By relaxing the requirement of additivity, Renyi generalized one form of this quantity using a parameter alpha. Von Neumann's formulation of this quantity sets it proportional to the trace of the density matrix times the natural log of the density matrix, though this quantity is more commonly understood in a Gibbs state and in a form named for Shannon, where it measures the amount of information needed to encode a state. In equilibrium thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy is equal to the enthalpy minus the temperature times this quantity. For 10 points, name this quantity which, according to the second law of thermodynamics, always rises.

answer: {Jacquerie}

Samuel Kline Cohn argues that the inefficiencies of a fiscally bureaucratic state and lingering effects of a previous famine were the impetus of this event. One chronicler of this event wrote about an attempt to pass constitutional reforms to the monarchy, called the Grand Ordinance. That bill was primarily backed by the head of the Third Estate, Etienne Marcel, who took over Paris with a peasant army that would eventually lose when besieging the fortress at Meaux. The leader of this event was tortured and murdered at a peace conference at Mello, which resulted in the now leaderless army being massacred in the subsequent battle. That leader was Guillaume Cale. For 10 points, name this popular revolt that was sparked by high taxes and the capture of King John II of France at the Battle of Poitiers, which has its name taken from its leader's nickname Jacques Bonhomme.

In 1811, this work was copied in bronze at the request of the Righetti brothers and was put in the courtyard of the Palazzo Brera in Milan. When finished, Vivant Denon advised that it should be the centerpiece of the titular patron's museum instead of the statue of Laocoon. At the base of this statue, a cloth is tied around a stump which actually supports the statue itself and seems to support the titular man's sword. He also has a toga draped over his left arm which is supported by his contraposto pose. The titular figure holds a long staff as well as an orb on which a gilded depiction of Nike stands. The archenemy of the titular apotheosized figure acquired this sculpture after purchasing a lot of art from the looting after Waterloo. For 10 points, name this sculpture by Antonio Canova featuring a French Emperor as a God of War in a seemingly contradictory role.
