answer: {quantum Hall} effect [or {quantized Hall} effect; or {QHE}]

The discovery of this effect was announced in a paper in which Michael Pepper and Gerhard Dorda were two of the three authors. The topological nature of this effect can be understood in terms of Fredholm indices and Chern numbers. The only known physical objects that can be considered anyons exhibit one form of this effect. That same form of this effect was discovered by Tsui and Stormer, and is seen at the electron Landau level filling fractions. This effect is used to define a standard of resistance as well as to give a very accurate determination of the fine-structure constant. This effect was first identified in the inversion layer of a MOSFET by a man who noticed that a plot of voltage versus magnetic field strength showed several plateaus. For 10 points, name this effect that was discovered by Klaus von Klitzing.

answer: {Cephalochordata} [accept {Amphioxus} or {Branchiostoma}; prompt on “{lancelets}” before mentioned”]

Pikaia and Yunnanozoon are two of the oldest known fossils of them. Food is digested in the iliocolonic ring and is enzymatically broken down in their hepatic cecum. The mouth of these organisms consists of a wheel organ that draws in water which is filtered by cirri on the oral hood. Like tunicates, water passes through a body cavity consisting of metapleural folds called the atrium and out the atriopore of organisms in this subphylum. Food particles are trapped in mucus by pharyngeal slits. These organisms are noted for their v-shaped musculature and flexible, body-length rod structure. For 10 points, identify these lancelets noted for having myomeres, notochords, and all the other distinctive characteristics of chordates.

answer: {Sapir}-{Whorf} hypothesis

An article by Geoffrey Pullum exposed one piece of “evidence” used to support this result, and David Bohm's Wholeness and the Implicate Order took one worldview implied by it and attempted to impose it on English by increasing the use of verbs. James Cooke Brown developed Loglan for the purpose of testing this hypothesis, whose original form contrasts the SAE view of time and continuity with that of the Hopi. Pullum's “The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax” demonstrates that Arctic peoples do not have significantly many more words for snow than other languages, weakening support for this statement. For 10 points, name this hypothesis named after two American linguists that states that one's language determines one's thought processes.
