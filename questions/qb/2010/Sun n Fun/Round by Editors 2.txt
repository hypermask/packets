answer: Max {Born}

This physicist co-developed an equation which defines the nonlinear generalization of electromagnetism, which is named after him and Infield. This physicist also co-names an equation that uses the electrostatic potential of an ionic lattice and a repulsive potential energy term, which has in its denominator the ion distance raised to his namesake exponent, which takes values between 5 and 12. The corresponding special relativistic equivalent of the classical rigid body is known as his eponymous rigidity. The statement in quantum mechanics that an observable corresponding to the Hermitian operator A with a discrete spectrum for a given wavefunction will have a measure equal to an eigenvalue of A is known as his rule. Sharing the Nobel Prize in physics with Walter Bothe in 1954, for 10 points, name this German who also has an approximation named after him and Oppenheimer.

answer: A. {J. Ayer}

This thinker described “what he saw when he was dead” in “The Undiscovered Country,” and attempts to eviscerate Wittgenstein's private language argument in The Concept of a Person and Other Essays. Like Bertrand Russell, this thinker engaged the Jesuit priest Frederick Copelston in a series of BBC debates on the nature of religious language. In his magnum opus he obviates religious statements as meaningless since they are neither tautologies nor can they be empirically verified, which leads to him to a meta-ethical principle known as emotivism. For 10 points, name this British logical positivist philosopher, author of such works as The Problem of Knowledge and Language, Truth and Logic.

This work begins with the story of Monameki in a section titled by a Guy de Teramond work. In “The Days and the Seasons” the author questions whether the story of Cimidyue represents the transition from the mythic genre to the novel.  Another section deals with the “quarrel between the sun and the moon” in the porcupine redaction in the section “The Wolfish Appetite.” This work, unlike the first two sections of the larger work in which it appears, deals with the myths of North American tribes. Followed by The Naked Man and preceded by, for 10 points, From Honey to Ashes, name this third section of Mythologiques, which ostensibly explains the beginnings of certain customs by Claude Levi-Strauss.

Relations prior to the first of this set of conflicts between the eponymous groups began to deteriorate when Christopher Newport attempted to find new trading partners. One engagement which triggered these conflicts involved the ransacking of the burial platforms of the wyroances in a raid led by John Martin. The first of these wars began when George Percy was sent to attack the Pasapahgegh capital. The arrival of the distressed “Third Supply” and the murder of John Ratliffe were the pretexts for the first of these conflicts and the storming and subsequent exile to Tangier Island of Chief Opechancanough's men by William Berkeley ended the second. Resolved by the Treaty of 1646, for 10 points, name this series of conflicts between settlers of the Virginia Colony and a local Indian tribe led by initially Wahunsunnacwah.

answer: density {functional} theory [accept {DFT}]

This theory replaces the dependence on the external potential, v of r, by a dependence on the density distribution from a straightforward generalization of the Legendre transform from the chemical potential to the number of particles. Considered the successor to the Thomas-Fermi model, this theory grew out of a 1964 paper, which stated that there is a unique relation between the external potential and the ground state electron density and reformulated the variational principle for electron densities. Those results are known as the Hohenberg-Kohn theories.  In this theory, one can use the Kohn-Sham equations to compute the molecular properties using the same algorithms used for Hartree-Fock methods. For 10 points, name this non-perturbation theory, an ab inito method for determining electron structure.

Alexius Comenus tasked Euthymius Zigabenus, a preparer of The Panoply, to refute the beliefs of this sect, who believed that the symbol of the cross is to be abhorred rather than venerated. Followers were divided into the slushateli, viarvashti and savarsheni. The earliest existing record of their theology comes in a work written in Staro-Slavic by St. Kozma and the name of this group means “Dear to God.” This sect rejected a pessimistic form of Paulician dualism, holding that everything, save the human soul, was created by Satan, the elder brother of Jesus. The Eastern European precursors of the Cathars, for 10 points, name this Gnostic dualistic sect emerging in Bulgaria in the 10th century.

answer: {protein folding} [prompt on partial answer]

One model to understand this process involves a bacterial chaperone system known as the GroEL/GroES protein complex, which is thought to sequester its target in its hydrophobic center and prevent aggregation. Conversely, another model claims that only uniqueness, stability, and kinetical accessibility of the central structure in this process are the necessary conditions for this to proceed, which is known as Anfinsen's dogma. This is hypothesized to be a directed process, since a random search for all possible configurations to find the lowest energy state would take 1077 years, though in reality local formations can occur in 10-100 nanoseconds, a result known as Levinthal's paradox. For 10 points, name this process where long unbranched chains of amino acids spontaneously change shape to form their three-dimensional stable or native configuration.
