answer: {cyclic AMP} [or {cAMP}; or {cyclic adenosine monophosphate}]

The 8-Br variety of this molecule is a brominated derivative of it, and is therefore longer lasting. In the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, this molecule acts as an acrasin by regulating the process of aggregation. After determining the role of epinephrine in the liver, Earl Sutherland discovered this molecule. By permanently activating a G-protein, cholera increases the amount of this molecule produced. It binds to the catabolite activator protein in the lac operon when glucose levels are low. This molecule's production is catalyzed by adenyl cyclase, while its inactivation is performed by phosphodiesterase. It usually functions by activating protein kinase A. For 10 points, name this second messenger derived from ATP.

answer: {saxophone}

The choral work Chant Sacre contained the first use of this instrument in an arrangement conducted by its composer in 1844, the same year that this instrument was exhibited at the Paris Industrial Exhibition.  This instrument was used in Georges Bizet's L'Arlesienne suites 1 and 2. Hector Berlioz was a good friend of the creator of this instrument, and described it in an 1842 magazine article.   Played by such figures as Andres Lundegarde and Eugene Rousseau; Benjamin Vereecken wrote a book about the Foundation of playing this instrument, which was also notably featured in Charles Ives' Symphony No. 4 and Sergei Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kije and Larsiene suites.  For 10 points, name this namesake single-reed woodwind instrument, which plays a famous solo in Bolero.

answer: Charles {Bukowski}

One poem by this author discusses “watching tired housewives” who try “to fight off/their beer-maddened husbands.” Another poem by him mentions “a tomb of a room/without cigarettes.” In addition to “And The Moon And The Stars And The World” and “Poem For My 43rd Birthday,” Ecco Publishing has released a number of new volumes by this poet including The Flash of Lightning Behind the Mountain. He castigates poets, poetry and himself in “B as in Bullshit,” and a novel by him is about a man who searches Los Angeles for a job. In addition to Pulp, another work follows the same protagonist and his love Jane Conney Baker, known as “Betty.” For 10 points, name this author who included Henry Chinaski in works like Post Office, Factotum and Ham on Rye.

answer: {Zeeman} Effect

Mössbauer spectroscopy involves the observation of phenomena including isomer shifts and this.  An equation describing it contains an electron spin g-factor of approximately two. It was first observed by its namesake in the D lines of sodium and its anomalous variety occurs when electron spin contributes to this phenomenon. A potential energy associated with it is proportional to the Bohr magneton, the Lande g-factor, and the z component of the total momentum. This is the magnetic analog to the Stark effect, and in strong fields it becomes the Paschen-Back effect. The inverse type of it considers absorption lines as opposed to spectral lines. For 10 points, name this splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field.

answer: {Niddah} [accept “{separation}” until mentioned or {clear knowledge} equivalents like “{ritually impure state} a {woman} is in {because} of {menstruation}”]

One can use a bedikah to determine if a person is still in this state. Many of the rules related to this condition are described in Leviticus 15:19-30, and an abnormal version of this is known as Zavah. The name for this is used in the description of the red heifer ceremony in reference to the “waters of sprinkling, and Abraham ibn Ezra suggests that this condition is related to menadekkem which means “to be cast out.” Also naming the Talmudic section concerning laws regarding sexual relations, such relations are forbidden in this state. Typically lasting for seven days after which a mikveh may be performed, for 10 points, name this term from Judaism that means “separation” and generally refers to the state in which a Jewish woman is considered ritually impure due to her menstrual cycle.

answer: Isaac Bashevis {Singer}

He wrote about the effect that a convert had on the local villagers in one novel, while the real-estate investor Boris' Upper West Side party is attended by a number of academics including Professor Shrage and Halperin, whose moustache made him look like Nietzsche. In addition to Shadows on the Hudson, his interest in vegetarianism can be seen in works like The Slaughterer, and he wrote another novel in which the title character is the daughter of Bashele and Zelig and is loved by a writer named Aaron Gredinger, who is nicknamed Tsutsik, and is titled Shosha. This author's first published novel focuses on two characters who commit adultery on the eve of Yom Kippur.  For 10 points, name this author of Satan in Goray and The Family Moskat, a Yiddish-language Nobel laureate from Poland.

answer: Battle of {Tondibi}

The losing commander at this battle had just taken control of his country after a viceroy who had previously failed to subdue the Kebbi and quell the Katsina revolt.  The winning commander at this battle was able to maneuver his arquebusiers into place against the opposing forces' cavalry, and the noise of the gunfire and cannon sparked a stampede by the cattle that the losing commander at this battle had hoped to use to as a screening force for his infantry.  The winning side captured the salt mines of Taghaza before advancing to this battle's site just north of the capital of its losing side, Gao.  For 10 points, name this battle, in which Askia Ishaq II was defeated by Judar Pasha, a 1591 battle that eventually resulted in the destruction of the Songhai Empire.

answer: Archaeopteryx

Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer described one of the initial discoveries of a fossil of this animal, and its first skeleton was found near Langenaltheim, Germany before being given to Karl Häberlein.  This species features a notable hyperextendable second toe, sometimes referred to as a "killing toe" and John Ostrom found that this species was similar to the family Dromaeosauridae.  The least complete skeleton of this animal is currently located at the Teylers Museum, and the most complete specimen of this animal was discovered by Jakob Niemeyer before being traded for a cow.  The Haarlem and Berlin Specimens are examples of, for 10 points, what animal, whose fossils were found in the limestone deposits of Solhnofen, Germany, a primitive species of bird?

answer: {Markovnikov's} rule

A formal nucleophilic substitution at enantiopure 1 when catalyzed by titanium(IV) chromate can be classified as anti-this rule, and that term also describes hydroboration.    This rule occurs because of induction and hyperconjugation, and because of the formation of a stable carbocation during an addition process.  This rule is also illustrated by the reaction of propene with hydroboric acid. This rule was stated after its namesake observed the reaction between hydrogen iodide with vinyl bromide, and it was based on another rule. For 10 points, name this rule, which states that when a protic acid is added to an alkene, the hydrogen atom gets attached to the carbon atom with the greatest number of hydrogens.

answer: The {Subjection} of Women

This work claims that "the anxiety of mankind to interfere in behalf of nature, for feat lest nature should not suceed in effecting its purpose, is an altogether unnecessary solicitude", and this work also claims that "the unspeakable ignorance and inattention of mankind in respect to the influences which form human character" is the greatest "of all difficulties which impede the process of thought".  This work's author wrote that his purpose in writing this work was to explain that "the principle which regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes...is wrong in itself", and it ends by asserting that women have been left with a Hobson's choice between being an odalisque or a domestic servant.  For 10 points, name this early feminist essay by John Stuart Mill.
