answer: {MAP Kinases} [or {Mitogen}-{Activated Protein Kinases}]

The pyridyl nitrogen of one inhibitor of this class of molecules forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain amido nitrogen of residue 109, which is found in the ATP pocket. That inhibitor is pyridine-imidazole, and these enzymes are activated by dual phosphorylation of conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation loop. In 2003, the pyridol-pyrimidine class of these molecule's inhibitors were shown to have a previously unseen degree of specificity for the alpha isoform of one class of this molecule, which is activated by lipopolysaccharide. For 10 points, name this enzyme whose JNK and p38 classes respond to stress stimuli, and which has a namesake cascade.

answer: {Xian} (shee-an) incident

The main coordinator of this action lived in a house where hams hung from the ceiling, because he followed an alternative medical regime under which he ate nothing but ham. It was resolved partially due to the efforts of Australian advisor W.H. Donald, and it was a direct protest of the extension of the Encirclement Campaign for “bandit suppression.” Culminating in the formation of the second United Front, it involved the capture of a man who fled to the hills in his pajamas, and was perpetrated by two men who were dismayed by orders to attack Yenan in order to rout survivors of the Long March. Those generals, Yang Hucheng and Zhang Xueliang, wished an end to the policy known as “domestic pacification before external resistance,” and thus kidnapped Chiang Kai-Shek in, for 10 points, what 1936 event marking the beginning of Nationalist-Communist collaboration against Japan's occupation of China?

David Whitcomb developed Scorpion molecules for use in this assay, which can also use a reporter that has a FAM fluorescent reporter tethered to a TAMRA or MGB quencher. Dimers can be detected by adding a dissociation stage at the end of this assay and searching for spurious peaks. A common method of analyzing the data in this assay is the REST software, or if efficiency is set to 1 the delta-delta Ct method is sufficient. GAPDH or Hexokinase are commonly used housekeeping genes in this assay, which also employs either Taqman probes or SYBR green fluorescent dye. Operating on the assumption that a more abundant DNA molecule will amplify more quickly, for 10 points, name this variation of PCR often used in gene expression studies, which is capable of assaying for the amount of transcript or sequence in a sample.

answer: First and Second {Thessalonians}

Problems in translating these two texts include the meaning of the term “katechon,” which means either “the power that restrains lawlessness” or “an agent of Satan.” That term appears near a passage that reminds listeners that the end of the world will not come until after the “lawless man” is revealed. Both John Smith and Vladimir Lenin used as a slogan a passage from one of these texts, "He who does not work, neither shall he eat." The first of these texts also condemns the mourning of the dead, because the dead will be resurrected. Usually placed between Colossians and First Timothy, this pair of texts is notable for the lengthy thanksgivings which open each one. For 10 points, identify these New Testament epistles, addressed to converts made by Paul in Macedonia.

answer: {pentose} phosphate pathway [accept {phosphogluconate pathway} or {hexose monophosphate shunt}]

In one step of this process the hemiacetal hydroxyl group located on carbon 1 of the glucose 6-phosphate is converted into a carbonyl group via dehydrogenation, which then generates a lactone and a NADPH. Also in that same phase, oxidative decarboxylation occurs, wherein a NADP+ becomes an electron acceptor, producing another molecule of NADPH, CO2, and ribulose 5-phosphate. The primary rate controlling enzyme in this process is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In plants, it is suggested that this process is used primarily to produce intermediates for new plant constituents such as ribose for RNA and erythrose 4-phosphate. Consisting of an oxidative and non-oxidative phase, for 10 points, name this alternative pathway to glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol and creates 5-carbon sugars.

answer: {Kabbalah} and Criticism

The author of this work initially presents descriptions of Gnosticism and Neo-Platonism, as they represent two opposing visions of one of his title subjects. In a later section of this work he presents a succinct summary of the “nature of poem,” and presents the religious, organic, rhetorical and metaphysical illusions that are present within poetry. This text presents his concept of the “dialectic of revisionism” and clarifies its function for strong poets and strong critics, a topic he has taken up in other works such as The Anxiety of Influence. Relying on the scholarly studies of Gershom Schloem and Isaac Luria's “misreading” to the trace the evolution of the title subject from the medieval book of Zohar, for 10 points, name this work of literary criticism which examines the mystical Jewish tradition written by Harold Bloom.

Experiments in this field include Lawrence Sherman's Minneapolis research as well as the product of research into six hundred events in Philadelphia by Marvin Wolfgang. The first person to use a statistical approach in this field was Adolphe Quetelet, who noted the "astonishing constancy" of the male/female ratio. Its other luminaries included a man who wrote a namesake textbook, Edwin Sutherland, the inventor of “atavism,” Cesare Lombroso, and a figure who wrote of the disconnect between social goals and available means causing “strain,” Robert K. Merton. Samuel Romilly was one of the first people to put ideas of this field into practice, having been influenced by the work of Cesare Beccaria. For 10 points, identify this field which studies people such as Richard Speck, Bernie Madoff, and John Gotti.

answer: {Bayesian} statistics

For this statistical approach, even if the parametric space usually labeled omega is zero, and thus a singleton, hypothesis testing can still proceed if one assigns a positive probability to pi sub naught, for the simple hypothesis. In this statistics, one can choose a prior density giving equal weight to all possible values of theta, in the case where little information can be obtained regarding past events, which are known as non-informative priors. The central feature of this statistical approach is the synthesis of the prior distribution and current sample data into a posterior probability distribution. Utilizing its namesake's theorem, which relates the conditional probability and its inverse, and first discussed in the 1763 essay “Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances,” for 10 points, name this statistical method named after an English Presbyterian minister.
