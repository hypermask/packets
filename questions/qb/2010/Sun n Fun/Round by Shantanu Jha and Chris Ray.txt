answer: The {Lower Depths} or {Na dne}

One character in this play gives three soliloquies extolling truth and choice and concluding “Man is superior to his belly!” Another character claims he is a pilgrim and sings of how the “road is lost in darkness,” a theme taken up in a song about life as a prison sung by Krivoi Zoba and Bubnoff. The Qu'ran is championed by the Tartar, and Klescht occupies himself with a perpetually broken lock while his wife Anna dies despite the comforting words of Luka, whose well-intentioned chicanery incites the ire of Sahtin.  Natasha turns on her lover Pepel when he kills Kostilioff, who owned the title location, which is a large underground lodging house. For 10 points, name this play, the most famous of Maxim Gorky.

answer: A {Theory} of {Justice}

This work draws on Wilhelm von Humboldt's The Limits of State Action in formulating the community of humankind that extends across time. This work formulates a “four-stage” sequence for the flow of knowledge and one chapter considers the connection between excellences, shame, and the primary good of self-respect. It permits an “excusable general envy” in one chapter, while the first chapter discusses the point where principles and judgment meet, called “reflective equilibrium.” It introduces the liberty principle and difference principle as part of the title concept “as fairness,” though it also introduces the “original position.” For 10 points, name this work of moral and political philosophy by John Rawls.

The eighth of these works shows a mauve-and-black circle with a light red halo in the top left, while the last has an uncharacteristic black background. The fourth was reprinted in an essay on Scriabin, and that work depicts a castle on a mountain and violet sabers brandished by battling Cossacks at the top left. One shows a thick, curving black line across the canvas as barely discernable angels blow their trumpets in the top right. The sixth uses a rosy pink and white vortex at left as one of its three centers, another of which is marked by the use of parallel lines to indicate rain. Including works called Resurrection and Deluge, for 10 points, name this painting series with a musical name, a group by Wassily Kandinsky.

answer: {Palladium}

The allylation of nucleophiles with allylic halides is one example of the Tsuji-Trost reactions catalyzed by this element. Eaborn discovered that it can catalyze the reaction of aryl halides with hexa-n-butyldistannane, and more broadly it underlies the reaction of vinylic and aromatic systems with organostannanes in the Kosugi-Migita-Stille coupling. Also used for the coupling of alkenes and either halides or pseudohalides in the Mizoroki-Heck reactions, this element's chloride is reduced by calcium carbonate before lead acetate is added in the creation of a catalyst which is named for Lindlar. For 10 points, name this element, the least dense of the platinum group metals.

answer: Election of 1924

One convention prior to this election saw the capitulation of New Jersey Governor George Silzer.

answer: {Merovingians}

Christianized by men like St. Columbanus, their decline began when judges began to be appointed only within their own regions after the Edict of Paris.

answer: {CSF} or {Cerebrospinal} fluid [or, {apparently}, {Liquor cerebrospinalis}, {worst martini variant ever}]

The presence of beta-2 transferrin is a method used to differentiate this substance, whose electrophoresis in MS patients uniquely displays gamma region spikes known as oligoclonal bands. A study linked violent crime with abnormally elevated levels of a certain protein in this substance while its primary synthesis occurs in the choroid plexus. It enters the bloodstream through the venous sinuses, where specialized villi indent the dura mater from the arachnoid and allow this substance's secretion. Analyzed in a serum albumin ratio test, it is separated from the circulatory system by the blood-brain barrier.
