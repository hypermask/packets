answer: {buffer overflow} [accept {buffer overrun}; prompt on {code injection}; prompt on {overflow}; accept {stack smashing}]

Lam and Ruwase developed a dynamic approach to stop this from occurring called CRED. Utilizing one of these often involves a NOP sled and one common method of stopping their use places a randomized canary values to be checked in the prologue and epilogue. Recent advances in countering them include instruction set and address space randomization. They commonly involve functions like scanf and strcpy, which are found in C. They are common in languages that do not do bounds-checking on arrays. For 10 points, name this type of flaw in a computer program where data is written beyond the intended boundary of a data structure and are a common source of security vulnerabilities.

answer: {Mach} number

The actual pressure coefficient is equal to the low velocity pressure coefficient divided by the square root of one minus this value squared according to the Prandtl-Glauert rule. When the local value of this approaches unity, the freestream value of it, is termed critical. When this number is equal to one at a nozzle, choked flow can occur and when it's less than 0.3, the flow is considered incompressible. This is equal to the velocity of the flow divided by the square root of the product of RT and the ratio of the specific heats at constant pressure and volume respectively. That denominator simplifies to the speed of sound in the medium, meaning this value is the ratio of velocity to the speed of sound. For 10 points, name this number that is greater than one for supersonic velocities.

Considering the social contract, this man proposed the Staatsburgervertag as a worldly manifestation of the Rechtslehre, or “doctrine of right.' This thinker argued that man discovers his own limitations in his conception of the Anstoss, or “check.” This man proposed that the system of philosophy one chooses depends on the type of person one is in distinguishing between his own philosophy and dogmatism. This thinker proposed the “self-positing of the I” as the foundation of his worldview, the Wissenschaftslehre. In another work, this man argued that laws contrary to morality cannot be the creations of a divine being; that work was published without his name, leading it to be attributed to Kant.

answer: {carbene} [accept {Fischer carbene} before “{high oxidation states}”]

One approach to synthesizing this compound was described by Hegedus and Semmelhack. The reaction for one type of these with alkynes to yield alkoxyphenols was discovered by Karl Dötz and is better known as a benzannulation reaction. One classical way of making these is done by conducting a nucleophilic addition of an organolithium compound to a metal carbonyl and then treating with a trialkyloxonium salt. This compound can be found in Grubb's catalyst and those with high oxidation states and an unpaired triplet state are named for Schrock, which contrast with those named for Fischer. For 10 points, name these organic compounds with a divalent carbon atom that has only six valence electrons.

answer: Daniel {Kahneman}

With Jackson Beatty, this psychologist discovered that when students listened to numbers they had to memorize, their pupils dilated, and contracted when reciting the digits. Along with a common co-author he proposed a problem testing people's understanding of Bayes theorem called the cab problem, and explored the occurrence of people giving special weight to a particular probability called the certainty effect.  This lead to his most famous theory, which is expanded upon in Choice, Values, and Frames. It comes out of the Allais paradox and says that decisions have editing and evaluation phases. That theory supersedes expected utility theory and predicts that people will be risk seeking during losses.  For 10 points, name this man who with Amos Tversky proposed prospect theory.

Abreu-Goodger and Merino devised the most prominent software for detecting these structures that can come in “tuning fork” arrangements. The proposed moco and tuco examples bind to metal containing components and one associated with the B. subtilis glycine cleavage operon has both type I and II components that act cooperatively. They are associated with TH1 box binding to TPP and thus can regulate thiamine biosynthesis. These structures with an expression platform and a natural aptamer are found in the 5' UTR and work by the formation of a stem loop that either stops transcription via terminator loops or prevents transcription by hiding the Shine-Delgarno sequence. For 10 points, name this form of gene regulation in bacteria where the mRNA binds a metabolite and thus turns on or off the expression that mRNA.

answer: {urea} cycle [accept {ornithine cycle} before mentioned]

Sodium phenylburate is often used to treat suffers of disorders of this pathway. Defects in transporters found in this pathway can lead to HHH syndrome and Lysinuric Protein Intolerance. N-acetylglutamate is an allosteric activator of a key enzyme in this pathway. Aspartate and Citrullyl-AMP are used in one step of this reaction to form arginosuccinate.  Like a connected pathway, fumarate is a byproduct of this reaction. In the mitochondria, citrulline is formed using a transcarbamoylase. Two amino acids that are part of this pathway are arginine and ornithine, and this cycle is sometimes named for the later. This cycle allows the body to deal with overconsumption of protein. For 10 points, name this cycle which generates a namesake compound allows the body to remove excess nitrogen.
