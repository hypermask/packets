answer: Battle of {Boyaca}

In this battle's run-up, the eventual loser attempted to anticipate the opposition's advance to the capitol but they were beaten by an all-night march through a shortcut near Tunja. General Anzoátegui's move to split the Spanish rearguard and vanguard near Casa de Piedra proved decisive during this conflict. Along with General Santander, and arriving from Papia after a narrow victory at the Battle of Vargas Swamp, Bolivar was able to flank General Barerio's rearguard. After the Spanish forces fled, Coronel Juan Taira was left alone on a bridge, which now commemorates the victory. Beginning a series of victories for the Independentist armies culminating in Ayacucho, for 10 points, name this August 1819 battle fought in what was then New Grenada near Bogota, Columbia.

It is possible that it was painted as a sign for a café operated by Belloni. A statue with very narrow eyes and large ears stands concealed by trees on the right side of this painting. Just beside that statue is a man in a white flame-like pointed hat and a man with noticeable red clothing that surround a woman wearing white. Those characters in this painting used as a signboard for the Théâtre de la Foire are known as Léandre, Isabel, and the Captain. The Doctor sits low to the left of the titular figure who stands predominantly in the foreground of this painting. His large white shoes have pink laces and he is dressed in all white, baggy clothing. A portrait of a Pierrot during intermission, for 10 points, identify this work about the titular clown painted by Jean-Antoine Watteau.

answer: {compact} [accept word forms]

This type of surface has a finite number of triangles in its triangulation, examples of which include a torus. A Hausdorff space is termed “para” this when each open cover possesses a finite open refinement. On a continuous set of functions, this property is possessed by a subset which is uniformly closed, equicontinuous, and pointwise bounded as a result of the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. Further, it is possessed by any set for which there exists a finite subcover for every open cover or, in the real number case, when every sequence has a convergent subsequence according to the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem. For 10 points, name this property which, according to the Heine-Borel theorem, is possesses by any nice set that is closed and bounded.

answer: {Pataliputra} or {Patna}

Hiwen Thsang in the 5th century found an abandoned city near this city's location, which was then called Kusumapura. Diodoros claims that this city was founded by a Herakles-like figure, Bala-Rama, a brother of Krishna, though native sources attribute its founding to Raja Udayaswa or Ajata Satru.  Pliny mentions that it may have been sacked by the Graeco-Bactrians, but this is disputed. During the Mahajanapada period, it was the capital of the Magadha kingdom.  It was strategically placed on the south bank of the Ganges River, so the later Indian empires that used it as a capital and cultural center were able to effectively administer northern India. This was particularly useful for the Nanda, Mauryan and Gupta dynasties, which all used it as a capital. For 10 points, identify this Indian city, currently the capital of the state of Bihar.

answer: {femaleness} [prompt on “{sex determination}”, “{gender determination}”, or the like accept things that {suggest} that {thing we} are {talking} about is {female}]

In Drosophila, one molecular basis for this characteristic is the production of Sxl protein, which allows for production of the Tra molecule that blocks an intron in the DSX gene, yielding a truncated Dsx protein. In cucumbers, one can make this determination by the presence of higher levels of ethylene promoted by the F/f gene. In humans, those with this characteristic produce a large silencing Xist RNA early in development to carry out the lyonization process. That process serves to inactivate about 85% of a certain chromosome in individuals with this determination, whose phenotypic qualities are seen in individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome. For 10 points, name this characteristic possessed by humans with two X chromosomes.

answer: William {Hazlitt}

This author attempted a definition of “genius” in his essay about street performers, “The Indian Jugglers.” His work subtitled “The New Pygmalion,” a thinly veiled description of his attempts to seduce Sarah Walker, provoked much outrage. That book, Liber Amoris, preceded another scandalous work, an essay in first person depicting this author's visit to an illegal bare-knuckles boxing match titled “The Fight.” That essay was collected with other pieces, including the essay in which he describes reading Lyrical Ballads in manuscript, “My First Acquaintance with the Poets,” and his “On the Pleasure of Hating,” in the collection Table Talk. Known for his personal and casual style, in contrast to his friend Charles Lamb, for 10 points who was this Romantic-era author of The Spirit of the Age?

answer: {Fronde}

A speech given by Omer Talon presaged the first phase of this event. The title of a tract by Pierre Scarron attacking the title figure lends its name to the torrent of abusive publications accompanying this event, sometimes considered the first mass use of the printing press for propaganda. The agreement to nullify the king's letters of cachet as well as the July and October declarations of parliament ended the first phase in the Peace of Rueil. That first phase began in earnest with the arrest of Pierre Broussel for leading anti-tax legislation, leading to the second Day of the Barricades in Paris. Followed by a second phase involving intrigues against the regency of the young king, for 10 points what is this uprising against the policies of Cardinal Mazarin from 1648-53?

answer: {François Villon}

One of this author's poems notes, “Necessity makes people err, And hunger drives the wolf from the woods.” Two lines from one of this man's poems were adapted in a Berthold Brecht poem set to music by Hans Eisler and Kurt Weil for the work, The Roundheads and the Pointedheads. In that poem, “Nannas Lied” Brecht kept this author's interrogative but changed the time frame. The lines by this author written while he awaited his execution, “Brothers, men who live after us, Let not your hearts be hardened against us,” are used to open Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. Author of “Ballad of the Hanged Men,” for 10 points, name this medieval French poet who wonders, “Where are the snows of yesteryear?” in “Ballad of the Dead Ladies,” and wrote The Great Testament.

answer: {alcohol dehydrogenase} [prompt on “{ADH}”]

The cinnamyl-specific variety of this enzyme catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of lignin monomers. First isolated in yeast and later horse liver, this enzyme has an active site containing His-51 and Ser-48 residues that participate in key deprotonation steps. The active site is similar to carbonic anhydrase in that four cysteines form a tetrahedron around a zinc atom that coordinates to this enzyme's main substrate. It functions by transferring protons from that namesake substrate to NAD+ or NADP+ to generate an alkoxide, which then yields a carbonyl product. For 10 points, name this enzyme responsible for oxidizing alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, thereby serving a role in ethanol metabolism in those who drink the hooch and an oft cited cause of hangovers.

answer: {Naming} and {Necessity}

The author of this work is sensitive to a piece of terminology that invites the spurious problem of “transworld identification,” and thus to avoid Weltangst the author suggests one can replace “possible worlds” with modal talk. This work uses the phrase “The table is made of wood” and the statement of Goldbach's conjecture as examples of non-contingent a posteriori statements to clear up a confusion between a priori vs. necessary statements. Fundamentally, this works draws an explicit distinction between “giving the meaning” and “fixing the referent,” which is essentially a critique of Frege's use of sense, in order to establish a theory of non-rigid and rigid designators. For 10 points, name this work, originally a set of three lectures, which attempts to rehabilitate a Millian theory of names by Saul Kripke.

answer: Francis {Marion} [prompt on “{Swamp Fox}” before mentioned]

In anticipation of this man's advancement, Col. John Coming Ball dispatched a sentinel, who heard this leader's horses crossing the Willtown Bridge. This leader nevertheless ordered Maj. Hugh Horrey to attack the Tory flank, while this figure headed east of Dollard's Tavern, during the Battle of Mingo Creek. This man's nemesis conducted the Waxhaw Massacre, helped General Cornwalis to victory at Camden, and attempted to set a trap for this leader at Jack's Ferry. After this man's heroics at Parker's Ferry in August, 1781, this figure was appointed brigadier general, and after the war served in the South Carolina senate. For 10 points, name this Revolutionary War hero, who earned his evasive nickname from Banastre Tarleton, the "Swamp Fox."

In one section of this novel, “His Life until the Age of 12” relates the wrongful arrest of his father for the theft of Murray's heifer and an odd accusation of tranvestism made against the central character. Though fictional, the author of this work attempted to mimic the writing style of its central character as evinced by Jerilderie Letter, and thus outside the frame narrative “S.C,” the novel proper contains no commas. Consisting of 13 sections, each ostensibly written by the central character, after that character and his love Mary Hearn rob two banks successfully, she emigrates to San Francisco, while he and the title group are betrayed by Thomas Curnow and are cornered in Glenrowan located in Victoria. For 10 points, name this Booker-prize winning historical novel about an Australian bushranger and outlaw, written by Peter Carey.

answer: Battle of the {Metaurus} River

The prelude to this battle saw an aiding army make significant progress, outmaneuvering Publius Scipio in Hispania, and arriving in Gaul later that year. Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius were sent to engage the armies later that spring. Initially cautious, the interception and foiling of the plot to merge the armies together set the stage for the main conflict. Realizing that the two consuls had merged themselves, Hasdrubal had prepared to retreat, yet his guides betrayed him and he was left to search futilely along the banks of the namesake river for an exit. Forced to face the consuls in battle, Hasdrubal held ground until Marcus Livius crashed and broke the Iberian flank. For 10 points, name this 207 BC battle a decisive Roman victory in the Second Punic War, in which Hasdrubal Barca met his inglorious and headless end.

answer: {aspartate} or {aspartic} acid [accept {D} or {Asp} before mentioned]

In 1980, Steiner et al showed that E. coli mutants could convert this compound into quinolinic acid, a precursor to NAD. Biosynthesis of pyrimidines begins with carbamoylation of this amino acid, two molecules of which are contained in the catalytic site of pepsin. Interconversion between it and oxaloacetate provides the antiporter activity necessary for malate transport into mitochondrial matrix. The fibronectin motif for integrin binding consists of arginine, glycine, and this amino acid, whose side chain with pKa 3.9 makes it useful in the catalytic triad of proteases along with serine and histidine. Its N-methyl D version stimulates namesake receptors implicated in epilepsy. Possessing one less carbon than the similarly structured glutamate, for 10 points, name this amino acid symbolized D or Asp.

answer: {Cass Gilbert}

After obtaining his first major commission, this architect brought along Rafael Guastavino, who introduced the “Catalan vault” to American architecture. After building the Beaux-Arts inspired, Minnesota State Capitol, this architect aesthetically broke with his influences to construct the red brick, Italian Gothic Realty Company Warehouse.  He utilized the Spanish Renaissance style for Battle and Sutton Halls on UT-Austin's campus. Much of his lasting contribution can be seen in such works as the West Street and New York Life Buildings, where he used neo-gothic ornamentation to stylize a rectilinear skyline. For 10 points, name this turn of the 20th century American architect and pioneer of the skyscraper, designer of the U.S Supreme Court and Woolworth buildings.
