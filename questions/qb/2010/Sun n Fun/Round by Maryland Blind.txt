answer: Frank Owen {Gehry} [accept {Ephraim} Owen {Goldberg}]

Skansa Beacon Inc. and this architect were being sued for design and construction flaws related to moisture buildup for a recent addition to the MIT campus. He entered the public conscious with corrugated cardboard furniture such as his Easy Edges Wiggle Side Chair. He designed the successor to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, $147 million over budget, but it received praise despite heating adjacent sidewalks to over 140 degrees with its stainless steel exterior walls. One building designed by this architect circumvented legal restriction on building height by being classified as a work or art, that building is the Jay Pritzker Pavilion. His most famous deconstructivist work utilized seemingly random curves to catch the light and sits above the Nervion River. For 10 points, name this Canadian-American Pritzker prize winning architect of the Guggenheim Bilbao.

answer: {Charterhouse} of {Parma}

A character in this work gets fake papers, which describes him as a dealer of barometers. After a character in this work is betrayed to the Austrian police, his banishment decree was modified by the Baron Binder, which demanded that he eschew all reading material written after 1720 except for the novels of Sir Walter Scott. After being arrested, the jailer's wife is able to conceal that character and provide him with the belongings of a soldier who had been arrested for stealing a cow and some silver spoons. Aunt Gina and Count Mosca try to assist the main character in this novel by sending him to seminary in Naples. The central character, an ardent admirer of Napoleon who grew up near Lake Como, ends up fighting at Waterloo. For 10 points, name this novel about the life and adventures of Fabrice del Dongo, who ends up becoming a monk in the title establishment by Stendhal.

answer: {Population inversion} [prompt on "{lasing}"]

Techniques such as PC-SPI and adiabatic RF pulses can be used to accomplish this during NMR spectroscopy. Intersystem crossing can trap materials in this state, as in phosphorescence, and these states are usually stabilized by selection rules preventing rapid spontaneous decay from a triplet spin-state. This condition cannot exist in a two-state quantum system according to Einstein's A and B coefficients, and this state is sometimes described by a negative temperature. Sometimes achieved via pumping, this state is required for an optical gain greater than one, via stimulated emission. For 10 points, name this situation commonly found in lasers in which the majority of particles exist in an excited state.

answer: {Etruscans}

After the greatest naval victory of this people and one of its allies, Diodorus claimed that they stoned to death the prisoners at the city at which this culture erected its Sarcophagus of the Spouses. Dionysisus of Halicarnassus relates that these victors at the Battle of Alalia saw their army of half a million repulsed by forces led by Aristodemus at Cumae, losing their control of Campania. Aristodemus also defeated an army of these people led by Arruns, at Arcia. Arruns's father had earlier been so impressed by a youth who stoically put his left hand into a fire after being captured by these people that he lifted his siege of Rome. Lars Porsena was a leader of, for 10 points, what civilization which provided many early Kings of Rome, including Tarquin the Proud, a predecessor of Roman culture eventually absorbed into Rome?

answer: The {Blood Knot}

Though it's not The Maids, a wind-up clock in this work allows characters to act out imaginary events, and one character claims he "can wrap up in the smell of” another when he dons his overcoat. One character in this play soaks his feet nightly in bath salts because he has footsore from his job as a gatekeeper at the zoo, and at the climax, that character spends his life savings on a suit instead of saving to buy a farm. One scene sees two characters play roles in apartheid and nearly come to blows. Those two characters invite a white pen pal to Port Elizabeth, but that woman, Ethel Lange, gets married and never visits. For 10 points, name this play about light-skinned Morris and dark-skinned Zachariah by Athol Fugard in which the title object is the bond between brothers.

answer: {Franz Lehár} [or {Lehár Ferenc}]

This composer wrote the song “You Are My Heart's Delight,” which was popularized by Richard Tauber. One work by this composer features grace notes on the second and third beats of its first theme, which also features a triangle and arpeggios by the harp. That work, which includes a coda in its sixth motif featuring ascending trumpet arpeggios as a parody of Wagner is often included in this composer's best known work. That work by this composer features a subplot where Camille attempts to seduce Valencienne with a fan with the words “I love you” written on it.” That work also sees the bar Maxim's replicated by the singer of the Vilja Song, Hanna, who seeks to marry Danilo. For 10 points, name this composer of “Gold and Silver Waltz,” which is often incorporated in his The Merry Widow.

answer: {Silurian} Period

The Arisaig Sea Cliffs date from this geologic period, during which eurypterids or sea scorpions first developed. The monograptus forms a useful zone fossil for this period, which is associated with limestone because of an explosion in coral reefs notably populated by brachiopods and crinoids. The supercontinent Laurasia began to form at the end of this period, which began with the Llandovery epoch and ended with the Pridoli. Both freshwater fish and jawed fish first appeared at the end of this period, as did cooksonia, the first vascular plants. This period was marked by stabilized, warm climates, and it was named by Sir Roderick Murchison while studying fossils in South Wales. For 10 points, name this period of the Paleozoic following the Ordovician and preceding the Devonian.

answer: Council of {Ephesus}

At this church council, a resolution was passed affirming that Antioch had no jurisdiction over Cyprus. Acacius of Mitylene defended another figure by quoting him as saying "We must not say that God is two or three months old." The emperor and Count Candidian supported the heretic denounced at this council, which was confirmed by St. Sixtus III. In the fifth session, John of Antioch was excommunicated, and the sixth session declared that one should not make any creed beyond the Nicene Creed. St Cyril accused the principle defendant of heresy at, for 10 points, what third ecumenical council of 431 that condemned Nestorianism?

This modern country is home to the ruins of Naletale, a site occupied by the Torwa, which are not far from the much larger ruins of Dhlo Dhlo, which was the home base of the Rozwi people. A historically questionable leader named Nyatsimba Motota left the area in what is now this modern nation to establish the city of Zvongombe in an area now part of this modern nation's northern neighbor while looking for salt. The above-named tribes were all Shona states, the predecessors of whom were creators of namesake birds carved from soapstone which were found in the ruins of the Great Enclosure of this nation's most famous site. For 10 points these peoples populated the plateau named for what modern nation in which Ian Smith was forced out when it was known as Rhodesia?

answer: {Josiah Royce}

He discussed the First World War in his work The Hope of the Great Community, and the potential for the namesake institution to promote peace in War and Insurance. This thinker propounded that the "central and essential postulate" of every religion is that "man needs to be saved," which was in direct reply to William James's The Varieties of Religious Experience, found in this thinker's The Sources of Religious Insight. In another work, instead of an Absolute mind, he posited the world as a universe of signs interpreted by a community of minds and guided by spirit of truth seeking. For 10 points, name this American absolute idealist who wrote The Problem of Christianity, The Philosophy of Loyalty, and The World and the Individual.

answer: {Yuri Dolgorukiy} (accept {Borey class})

Its central weapon system, slated to replace the Sineva, carries the NATO designation SS-NX-30. That system, however, has suffered at least seven failures in thirteen tests since 2004, the last occurring in December 2009, when that system fell victim to a possible third stage malfunction, which generated a much-photographed death spiral in the atmosphere over Norway. That system is called the Bulava. This class of vessel is meant to replace a class made famous by The Hunt for Red October, the Typhoon. For 10 points, name this forthcoming class of Russian ballistic missile submarine, sometimes referred to by the name of the first boat in the class, which is named after the Russian prince credited with founding Moscow.

answer: {Joseph S. Nye Jr.}

This thinker describes as "useful inefficiencies" the tendency of politicians to shelter interest groups from globalization. He claims in one work that the attraction of hard currency is too great for all but the most resolute despots to ignore, and cites the example of European indecisiveness in Yugoslavia to explain why there must be a power broadly acceptable to as a leader. This man co-developed the concept of “complex interdependence” in Power and Interdependence and he attacks foreign policy decisions that promote arrogance, unilateralism, and parochialism in his book Paradox of American Power. His most important theory suggests that the ability of a polity to attract others is through the legitimacy of its policies and the values that underlie them. For 10 points, name this co-founder, along with Robert Keohane, of neoliberalism and proponent of soft power.

answer: {Brideshead Revisited}, The {Sacred} and {Profane Memories} of {Captain} Charles Ryder

The introduction to the latest Random House edition of this text was written by the recently deceased critic Frank Kermode. One character in this work named her horse Beelzebub because “if you can ride the devil, you can ride anything.” A search for Effie at the Old Hundredth lands “Boy” Mulcaster in jail, and he is bailed out by the Canadian Rex Mottram, Julia's fiancé. Julia's brother first met the protagonist one night at Oxford by throwing up in his window, a precursor to his severe alcoholism later on. The novel opens as that protagonist, an architectural painter and soldier, unexpectedly catches sight of the titular estate. For 10 points, name this work narrated by Charles Ryder, a novel by Evelyn Waugh.

answer: {Microtubules} [accept {tubulin} until "{depolymerization}"]

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is caused by a mutation in a gene coding for a molecule associated with these. The drug Taxol prevents their depolymerization, as does nonhydrolyzable GTP, but Colchicine, colcemid, and nocadazol inhibit their polymerization. Tau proteins form these molecules into bundles, and MAPs bind to them. Kinesins and Dyenins move toward the plus and minus end respectively of these structures, and they form a nine plus two pattern in flagella. They form linear filaments from alpha and beta tubulin dimers, and are formed at the aster, though in animal cells they originate from a centrosome. For 10 points, name these components of the cytoskeleton along with actin fibers and intermediate fibers, molecular fibers that form spindle fibers during mitosis.

answer: Act of {Settlement}, 1701

One legislative response to this action was passed only after the Scottish parliament threatened to withhold needed funding and troops for Marlborough's forces in the War of Spanish Succession. That threat forced Royal Assent for the Act of Security, which briefly removed Scotland from the effects of this earlier legislation. One mandate of this legislation was the elimination of the monarch's power to appoint and dismiss judges, instead giving judges the right to serve until the monarch's death, with 1761 revision providing for lifetime tenure. Its provisions were finally extended to Scotland after the signing of the Treaty of Union. Fears of the accession to the throne of the “Old Pretender,” James Stuart, drove, for 10 points, the passage of what British act, which selected Sophia, Electress of Hanover, as successor and mandated that English monarchs not be or be married to Catholics, passed in 1701?

A Peter Taylor short story about the Dorset couple shares its title with this painting. One figure represented by a bald old man whose arm extends through most the top of this painting. An old woman pulling at her hair in the background of this painting is said to represent either Jealousy, or the effects of syphilis. Two discarded masks, in the right foreground, mirror the mask-like face of Oblivion in the background, who is trying to wrest a curtain from one of the title figures. In front of the curtain, a girl with a honeycomb and a snake's body peeks out from behind a putto throwing flower petals. One of the central nude figures appears to be slipping her tongue into her son's mouth as he gropes her breast. For 10 points, name this ambiguous allegorical painting by Bronzino.

This figure judged his son worthiness to marry Suseri-hime by having him sleep in a room full of snakes. This figure was convinced to engage a monster, when a couple near the River Hi offered their daughter, and this figure instructed that couple to brew eightfold-sake and construct attendant cupboards. A calmer version of this figure is said to have counted and named the plants and animals with his son, O-kuni-nushi. He once lost a bet with a relative when be bit her fertility beads to produce children, but more famously he threw a flayed horse through her sitting room scaring her so much that she hid in a cave.

One man who prevented one of these actions was later outed as gay by Harvey Milk, who convinced columnist Herb Caen to write that ex-marine Oliver Sipple was homosexual against Sipple's wishes. Sipple had caused a person attempting this action to misfire, leading the bullet to ricochet and graze a cab driver. Another attempt at this action was foiled by the man who is now head of security for the US Olympic Team, who at the time was able to jam the skin of his thumb into the firing mechanism of the gun used by another person attempting this action. Taking place just seventeen days apart, after the second of these actions the intended victim was able to go ahead with his meeting with Governor Jerry Brown in California. For 10 points, what action was attempted by Sarah Jane Moore and Lynnette “Squeaky” Fromme in September, 1975?

Some accused the author of this poem of plagiarizing part of Lydia Sigourney's poem “Musing Thoughts” published in her collection The Token. The “kingly halls” and “Babylon-like walls” are not lit by “rays from the holy heaven” and the "wilderness of glass" gives no hint that "each idol's damned eye" is bejeweled, though "a stir is in the air" that resembles "no earthly moans” suggest a “void within the filmy Heaven.” The "wreathed friezes" contain "the viol, the violet, and the vine" but the "shrines and palaces and towers" "resemble nothing that is ours." The poem ends with "waves" that "now have a redder glow" and "Hell, rising from a thousand thrones" and it opens with the observation that "Lo! Death has reared himself a throne." For 10 points, name this Edgar Allen Poe poem about the titular underwater town.

answer: Effective {Nuclear Charge} [accept {kernal charge}, accept {Z} or {Z}-{eff} or {Z}-{effective}, accept "{shielding constant}" until "{this quantity minus s}"]

This parameter is varied in Hartree-Fock methods to improve numerical stability, at first increased and then slowly reduced to its correct values as orbitals begin to converge. A set of equations used to correct this quantity were motivated by the trial wavefunction psi proportional to the negative exponential of an effective value for this quantity minus s. That set of equations were semi-empirically derived by Slater and can be used to find these values for use in the Allred-Rochow form of electronegativity, which assumes that this value decreases due to the shielding effect. For 10 points, name this value which, via Coloumb's law, determines how strongly electrons are bound to an atom.
