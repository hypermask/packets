Willa Cather's essay “148 Charles Street” describes her first meeting with this writer and her Boston-marriage partner, Annie Fields. One of this author's novels depicts the growing friendship between Helen Denis and Kate Lancaster, who visit the title town. Besides Deephaven, this author set her tale of Nan Prince's upbringing by the title character as an independent-minded young woman in the same state. However, A Country Doctor does not take place in this author's fictional town of Dunnet Landing, setting of many stories and her novel in which Mrs. Todd represents life on the land and Captain Littlepage life on the sea. Also author of a short story in which Sylvy refuses the hunter's bribe of ten dollars and a knife to provide the whereabouts of the title bird, for 10 points who is this author of The Country of Pointed Firs and “A White Heron”?

answer: Sadducees

This clan's interpretation of biblical law led them to reject immortality of the soul and resurrection, and their rejection of the application of purity laws to anyone outside the Temple and its priests led their antagonists to consider their women menstrually impure. Closely allied with the Boethusians, their influence reached its peak under John Hyrcanus and Alexander Janneus, though their power in the Gerousia was eliminated in the reign of Queen Salome Alexandra, who supported their primary rivals. Their main dispute with those rivals was this clan's rejection of oral law and all practices not named in the Pentateuch. With a name perhaps derived from the Temple priest during Solomon's time, Zadok, for 10 points what was this aristocratic, priestly clan of Jerusalem, the rivals of the Pharisees?

answer: {Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet}

One can show via the martingale convergence theorem that the proportions of different colored balls will approach a distribution named after this man for Polya's Urn. A certain kind of decomposition of a metric space, also known as a Voroni diagram is sometimes known as his tessellation. A proof that “a plus n times d” where a and d are coprimes contain an infinite number of primes is contained along with many of his other contributions to number theory in Dedekind's Lectures on Number Theory, and that result is his arithmetic progression theorem. The statement, “there does not exist an injective function on finite sets, whose codomain is smaller than its domain,” is a formalization of, for 10 points, this French mathematician's articulation of the pigeonhole principle.

answer: {Hausa} States

The quasi-mythological progenitor of this historico-political entity was given the nickname “The Man on the Ass” by Ibn Khaldun; that father of the founders of this entity was said to be a prince from Iraq named Bayajida, or Abu Yazid. Folklore asserts that Bayajida legitimized his right to rule in the city of Daura by killing a snake called Sarki, leading that name to be applied to later rulers of this polity. This kingdom's birane, or walled cities, were described as surrounded by walls of 25-60 feet by Englishman Hugh Clapperton, who visited the remains of this polity in 1826 after it had been subsumed by the Sokoto Caliphate. Emerging in the tenth century, for 10 points what was this collection of seven city states in what is now Nigeria and Chad?

answer: Giuseppe {Arcimboldo} (or {Archimboldo})

This artist collaborated with Giuseppe Meda on the gonfalone, or painted banner, of St. Ambrose of Milan. Gregorio Comanini describes this artist's creation of a musical notation system using colors instead of notes, which is lost. He created elaborate costume pageants for his best-known patron, including one in which that future monarch played an armored dwarf combating court members dressed as monsters and knights. He later created that monarch's wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities, as well as a portrait of that Habsburg Emperor based on an elegy written by Sextus Propertius. Best known for depicting Rudolf II as Vertumnus, for 10 points, who was this painter best known for composite portraits using vegetables, fruit, fish or other objects?

answer: “{Take Five}”

The first four measures of this song are carried solo by the drums, with the hi-hat and ride cymbal interrupted between the second and third beats by an extra snare strike by drummer Joe Morello. A repetitive E-flat-minor piano vamp-figure played by the band's namesake leader enters in the fifth measure, with the bass of Eugene Wright entering in the song's eighth measure and playing only on the first, fourth, and fifth beats. The alto sax of the song's composer then comes in with the primary melody, a hummable riff which made this the first instrumental single to sell over a million copies. Written by Paul Desmond in 5/4 time, for 10 points what is this tune, the best-selling jazz single of all time, first recorded on the album Time Out by the Dave Brubeck Quartet?

answer: {Debye}-{Hückel} equation

This formula includes a constant that is taken to be one and a half moles per kilogram to the one-half power according to the Bates-Guggenheim convention. The Pitzer equations can apply it to higher ionic strengths and Lars Onsager modified it to account for Brownian motion. Its extended version contains a B coefficient that is multiplied by the square root of ionic strength and is generally determined empirically. In order for it to be applicable, the solvent must be without structure and the solution must be dilute. According to this formula, counter ions cause electric potential to be screened at a distance greater than a length named for one of its formulators. For 10 points, name this doubly eponymous equation used to calculate activity coefficients.

answer: {Chile}

The exploits of the Spanish heroes Rengo, Tucapel, and Lautaro are recounted by Alonso de Ercilla in this nation's founding epic, La Araucana. Creacionismo was a Modernist literary movement created in Paris by a poet from this country, Vicente Huidobro. A more recent novelist from this nation wrote the memoir The Boom in Spanish-American Literature: A Personal History, as well as a novel in which the narrator Humberto takes on various guises, including The Mute and El Imbunche, while ostensibly telling the story of the deformed Boy, whose father Jeronimo surrounds him with freaks so he'll seem normal. Along with the author of The Obscene Bird of Night, Jose Donoso, this nation also produced the author of Crepusculario and Residence on Earth, as well as a collection of poems that includes “Tonight I Can Write.” For 10 points this is what nation, home to Pablo Neruda?

answer: {Miller} v. {California}

The decision in this case led to the abandonment of the so-called “Memoirs” test. Vagueness in this case's definition of its central focus led to challenges to its own namesake test by using worries over incitement to violence against women, though many city ordinances using this rationale were struck down by the decision in American Booksellers v. Hudnut in 1985. Its third prong was narrowed by the holding in Jenkins v. Georgia that the movie Carnal Knowledge could not be found patently offensive solely by the view of community standards regarding pornography. For 10 points, what was this 1973 case, the other two prongs of which stated that for a work to be obscene it had to be patently offensive and lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value?

answer: {Object Relations} Theory or {ORT}

Henry Guntrip introduced the concept of the repressed ego into this branch of psychology, coining the term “in and out” oscillation to refer to schizoid behaviors developed from inadequate development of this branch's namesake interactions. Guntrip synthesized the biological focus of D.W. Winnicott with the psychological focus of this one of this theory's central figures, Ronald Fairbairn. First developed by Karl Abraham, this theory's best-known advocate suggested the title interactions stemmed from an unconscious desire of an infant to transfer its death instinct to the external world, leading to “good” and “bad” forms of the title entities based on whether they give or withhold desires, such as milk. For 10 points what is this psychoanalytic theory most associated with Melanie Klein?

answer: {Sandmeyer reactions}

Hinds disproved Hodgson's hypothesis that iodide ion could catalyze this reaction, which can be used to convert GABA into GHB. The observation that this reaction also produced polymers of acrylonitrile established that its mechanism, still not fully understood, used radicals. Discovered when its namesake tried to synthesize phenylacteylene from cuprous actelyide and a benzene compound, the Schiemann reaction is a subtype of it that uses fluoroborate ion. An example of this reaction is the synthesis of p-chlorotoluene from p-toluidine. Usually catalyzed by copper (I) compounds, for 10 points, name this reaction that utilizes a diazonium salt to substitute the amine group in a primary aromatic amine.

answer: “The {Waking}”

The reader is advised to “take the lively air” in this poem, as “Great Nature has another thing to do/To you and me.” The speaker exclaims, “God bless the ground! I shall walk softly there,” and he “hear[s] his being dance from ear to ear.” A critical factor in one's interpretation of this poem is whether the repeated words “to sleep” are read as an infinitive or prepositional phrase. The poet breaks the rules of the villanelle form in the odd numbered stanzas by not exactly repeating the last line of the first stanza, “I learn by going where I have to go.” What is this poem that titles a 1953 collection by its author, Theodore Roethke, for 10 points, in which the speaker “wake[s] to sleep” and takes the title action slow?

answer: The {Third Man}

This movie's score features zither music by Anton Karas, and its namesake theme achieved #1 status on the Billboard Chart in 1950. Its extensive use of Dutch-angle shots, as exemplified in the “magic lantern” montage in which Major Holly convinces the protagonist that the title character is responsible for harming children, won cinematographer Robert Krasker the film's only Oscar, despite it later being voted the greatest British film of the 20th century. In its most memorable scene, the title figure, after a ferris wheel ride with the protagonist, tries to justify his crimes by noting that Italy under the Borgias produced great artists like Michelangelo, while the Swiss, with “500 years of brotherly love,” only produced the cuckoo clock. Featuring Joseph Cotton as Holly and directed by Carol Reed, for 10 points what is this Film Noir classic in which Orson Welles plays Harry Lime?

This race's contribution to the Greek attack on Troy was 40 ships commanded by Leontes and Polypoetes. Heracles, while allied with the Dorians, killed one general of this race, Coronus, in battle. Coronus's father was a famous member of this race who angered Zeus by insisting that mortals worship his spear. That mortal had been granted the wish of being changed into an invulnerable male after being raped by Poseidon. Being invulnerable, Caeneus had to be pounded into the ground during battle with their best-known enemies. Descendents of Ixion, for 10 points what is this race of Thessaly who, at the wedding of their king Pirithous, famously clashed with their cousins, the Centaurs?

answer: {Albany Regency}

This political organization elected Charles E. Dudley to fill the senate seat vacated by the organization's best-known figure when he took a governorship in 1829. John Adams Dix, Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln, was prominent in this organization and its later conservative offshoot, the Hunkers. Much of this organization's leadership had originally been part of a faction called the Bucktails who opposed the building of the Erie Canal specifically and DeWitt Clinton in general. This group's power waned after its incumbent governor, William Marcy, was defeated in 1838 by the Whig William Seward. For 10 points name this political machine associated with Martin Van Buren which controlled Democratic politics in New York.

answer: {bad faith} or {mauvais foi}

Ronald Santoni's 1996 work titled partly for this concept argues that its formulator and his commentators misguidedly opposed it to “authenticity.” This concept's formulator repeatedly associates it with images of petrification, literally calling it a desire for the “permanence of rock,” in his book Anti-Semite and Jew, stating that the anti-semite desires to be “a pitiless stone” because of his fear of his own liberty. This concept is described as a collusion of “flattery” between a certain Second Empire novelist and his audience in its formulator's book The Idiot of the Family, a study of Flaubert. Emanating from the anguish between the “dividedness” of the human situation between facticity and transcendence, for 10 points what two-word term names Sartre's conception of the human proclivity toward self-deception?

answer: {Redlich}-{Kwong} equation of state (Prompt on {RK}-{EOS}, should that come up)

One of this equation's successors used temperature-dependent omega coefficients and is more useful for liquid-phase enthalpies. Studied at high pressures by Zudekevitch and Joffe, Peneloux and Rouzy introduced a constant to this equation so that it would hold better for hydrocarbon chains of greater than about ten carbons. Many improvements on this equation use Pitzer's acentric factor so that it will hold better for substances in the liquid phase. The Peng-Robinson equation is one notable improvement as is the Soave modification.  The van der Waals correction parameter for molecular attraction is divided by the square root of temperature in this equation. For 10 points, identify this two-parameter, cubic equation of state that is just one of many improvements on the ideal gas law.

answer: The {Sleepwalkers}

The namesake of this novel's second section symbolically sometimes touches and fantasizes over a small reproduction of the Statue of Liberty. Medics wager two packs of cigarettes on whether a physically and psychically dismembered infantryman will live; Godicke's parts miraculously do knit together, and he survives. 26 chapters in this novel's third section provide the interplay between a “ballad” narrated by Bertrand Muller about the ill-fated love affair between a Salvation Army girl and a Jewish man and an essay by Muller examining the effects on people living between vanishing and emerging ethical systems titled “The Disintegration of Values.” With section titles: 1888, 1903, and 1918, as well as for Romanticism, Anarchy, and Realism, this is, for 10 points, what Modernist novel by Hermann Broch?

answer: {Constitutions} of {Clarendon}

This document clarified the handling of disputes over frankalmoign by mandating jury determination of cases brought before the Assize of Ultram. Another provision moved the adjudication of advowsons from ecclesiastical to secular courts. Restricting the travel out of the country by bishops without the monarch's permission, its promulgator argued for this document's necessity by citing the laity's outrage at the behavior of “criminous clerks.” Eight years after the signing of this document, its promulgator was confirmed as Lord of Ireland after humbling himself before Pope Alexander III for his role in the slaying of this document's most vocal opponent. For 10 points, the repudiation of his initial support for what 1164 set of laws enacted by Henry II led directly to the eventual assassination of Thomas a Becket?

answer: {Tzvetan Todorov}

This thinker critiqued the fanatical “ultra-materialist” view of the title time period as responsible for much of the horror of the 20th century in his book In Defence of the Enlightenment. He dedicated another book to the “memory of a Mayan woman devoured by dogs,” whose body he describes as the site of double colonization in the book's final chapter, “Las Casas's Prophecy.” That book, The Conquest of America, was followed by a work in which he challenged the idea that the gulags and concentration camps of the 20th century were places where man's essential virtues broke down. Author of Facing the Extreme, for 10 points, name this writer, a Bulgarian structuralist who examined the idea of the “uncanny” in The Fantastic: A Structural Approach to a Literary Genre.
