answer: {Epithelial}-{Mesenchymal Transition} [or {EMT}]

This temporary process is triggered when MMPs from stroma cells activate latent growth factors like TGF-beta 1 from the extracellular matrix. In monolayer cultures, this process involves vimentin, fibronectin, and N-cadherin being expressed rather than the normal expression of cytokeratins and E-cadherin. Addition of metalloproteinase-3 stimulates this process to cause the regular polygonal shape of certain cells to become more fibroblastic.  During healing of a wound, this change allows some cells to become motile and invasive because they could then move into the wound site to fill in the gap. Name this change in which cells from one type of germ line lose their anchoring connections to neighboring cells so that they resemble another type of cells from mesodermal origins, a shift in contrast to MET.

answer: {Artemis}

A temple to this deity as Limnatis was the site of the first battle between Messenians and Spartans, when the latter attacked the temple with ephebes dressed as women. Kallimakhos tells that this deity was worshipped as Hegemone in Ambrakia after she slew Phalaikos, using a lion cub, and an Athenian myth says that this deity was appeased at Brauron by teen girls “playing the bear”. This deity was worshipped as Laphria, complete with holocausts of wild animals, after Oineus refused to make offerings to her, causing this Potnia Thauron, or Mistress of Beasts, to dispatch the Kalydonian Boar. Another myth explains that this goddess helps women in childbirth, just as she aided her own mother with the birth of her brother. For 10 points, name this daughter of Leto and sister of Apollo.

answer: {Pierre Bourdieu}

This man argued against Hobbes' "all against all" view of social struggle, and instead argued that social life is similar to a game in which the rules are only understood by the privileged few. With Jean-Claude Passeron, this man wrote The Inheritors, which looked at the relationship between French students' social origins and academic achievement and concluded that education operates to legitimize division among classes. The subject of the film Sociology is a Combat Sport, this man also theorized that class fractions influence differences in aesthetic preferences in his book Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste. For 10 points, name this French sociologist, the author of Outline of a Theory of Practice.

answer: {phonons}

The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian is frequently used to consider electron interactions with these particles in conjugated polymers. Anharmonic forces between these particles can produce thermal resistance in nonmetals in what is termed a flip-over or Umklapp process. The contribution of these particles to the specific heat of a solid was treated by Debye by considering their density of states in an atomic lattice. Ionic crystals typically exhibit both their acoustic and optical forms, and BCS theory predicts these particles' interaction with electrons to yield superconductivity. For 10 points, name these bosons used to quantize the vibrational modes of a lattice.

answer: {Skara Brae}

In The Megalithic Builders, Euan MacKie identified this site, as well as Durrington Walls, as home to a sacred elite due to no evidence of game animals and its fine pottery. That pottery, Grooved Ware, is shared by this site with sites like Rinyo on Rousay and differs from the contemporary Unstan Ware found at Knap of Howar. The smashing of stones produced this site's characteristic discoidal knife, which was named by Gordon Childe for the bay on which this site lies, the Skaill Knife. House 7 here is the only one associated with human burial and had a door which could be locked from without, but shared the characteristic thick midden-filled walls of the other houses here. Consisting of the remains of ten houses, this is, for 10 points, what late Neolithic site on Mainland Orkney, the best preserved Stone Age site in Europe?

answer: {Dawes General Allotment} Act [or {General Allotment} Act or {Dawes Severalty} Act]

According to several works by Leonard Carlson, this act was detrimental to farming activity among populations not previously accustomed to the activity. David Jerome served as the head of one commission created by the Springer Bill to enforce this act, and the Supreme Court ruled in one case stemming from this act's passage that Congress's plenary power allows it to abrogate federal treaty requirements. That case was Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock. Though this act was repealed by the 1934 Wheeler-Howard Act, the 1906 Burke Act increased the number of forced fee patents issued under this act for the homesteads it provided in order to encourage greater acculturation. For 10 points, name this 1887 law, named for a Massachusetts senator, which broke up tribally owned reservations into 160-acre plots for individual Native Americans.

answer: {Higgs} Boson

A predicted super-partner for this particle would be a weak iso-doublet and have a hypercharge of one half. It is suspected that this super-partner, if combined with binos and winos would create the lightest possible super-symmetric particle, which would possibly be stable, and hence is a candidate for dark matter. This particle itself could not be more than 1.4 TeV in mass because otherwise it would be possible for certain probabilities not to sum up to one in scattering process. Current predictions for its mass are between 115 GeV and 150 GeV while its spin is anticipated to be zero. For 10 points, name this currently hypothetical particle, the carrier particle of its namesake field, responsible for the symmetry breaking that leads to particles gaining mass, the target of a high profile search at the Large Hadron Collider.

On the right of one of these works, a man on a telephone watches a couple having sex, as a pile of blood-drenched clothes sit in the center; another of these works depicts smoke seeping under a door on the left, as a melting figure enters the room on the right. Those two works were “Inspired by T.S. Eliot's Poem ‘Sweeney Agonistes'” and “by the Oresteia of Aeschylus” respectively. A set of three of these works are known as the “Black” and were inspired by the suicide of the artist's lover, George Dyer. In the most famous of these works, the leftmost figure hangs its hairy head, hiding its face, the central, blindfolded figure bares its teeth, and the mouth of the figure on the right is screaming at an impossibly wide angle. For 10 points, name these multi-panel works by an Irish artist, which include Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion.

answer: William Somerset {Maugham}

Selina Hines recently published a biography on "the secret lives" of this author. The author's lovers Alan Searle and Gerald Haxton probably disapproved of the statement that, “the homosexual has small power of invention, but a wonderful gift for delightful embroidery.” One of this author's short stories, the basis of the silent film Sadie Thompson, tells of a missionary's attempt to save a fallen woman who has moved to Pago Pago.  He reused elements from that short story “Rain,” in a novel about the painter Charles Strickland who becomes blinded by leprosy after he moves to Tahiti. The collection The Casuarina Tree includes such stories as the "Before the Party" and "P and O." For 10 points, name this author of The Moon and Sixpence and Of Human Bondage.

This people once ruled a vast trading empire first from the capital at K2, then from Mapungubwe, and Manyika was this people's first state to mine gold year-round, prompted by European traders. This people fought a series of wars in the late 17th century called the Changamire Wars, leading to the rise of Dombo as head of the Khami-based Rozvi Empire; Dombo was responsible for expelling Portuguese from among this people. Maputu and Torva-ruled Butwa were successors of an earlier state of this people, which dominated gold and ivory trade to the Indian Ocean down the Zambezi, Limpopo, and other rivers, and which is most noted for a massive stone city. For 10 points, name this southern African people, which built the city of Great Zimbabwe and which are the largest ethnicity of the modern state of Zimbabwe.

answer: {ghrelin}

This protein is responsible for the activation of the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase in a pathway that includes Akt by acting as a ligand for GHSR, a growth hormone receptor. When found in the hippocampus this hormone contributes to neurotrophy, and its active form has a notable octanoylated form.  Patients with Prader-Willi disease are found to have increased levels of this hormone. Produced by P/D1 cells, it was first discovered by Kojima et al. in 1999. One function of this hormone features the suppression of fat utilization in adipose tissue. Antagonistic to leptin, for ten points, name this hormone also found in the epsilon cells of the Islets of Langerhans that is produced in the stomach and stimulates appetite as its main function.

answer: Word of {Faith} Movement [or Word of {Faith} Theology or {Word}-{Faith} Movement; accept “{Faith Movement}”, “{Faith Message}”, and “{Faith Formula}” but prompt on “{Faith}”; accept “{Positive Confession}”, “{Health} and {Wealth Theology}” and “{Prosperity Theology}” or {charismatic Pentecostal theology} before {each} is mentioned]

In a 1980 paper rejecting this theological movement, the Assemblies of God denied its emphasis on “rhema”, or the spoken word, imbued by the Holy Spirit with God's creative and revelatory power. Other controversial beliefs of this theology include belief in Christ's spiritual death and the claim that humans are gods. The earliest basis for this theology appears in the writings of Baptist minister E.W. Kenyon, who developed belief in “positive confession” of Biblical promises, and it was popularized by Kenneth Hagin, who is regarded as the “father” of this movement. This theology is at the heart of popular devotional material such as the “Prayer of Jabez” and prominent contemporary promoters include T.D. Jakes, Benny Hinn, Fred Price, and Kenneth and Gloria Copeland. Emphasizing “health and wealth”, this is, for 10 points, what charismatic Pentecostal theology, often called “prosperity theology”?

answer: {Jahn}-{Teller} effect [accept {pseudo Jahn}-{Teller effect} before {Longuet} is {spoken}]

One possible cooperative example of this effect is the vibronic theory of ferroelectricity, an idea that was first suggested by Bersuker. Longuet-Higgins was responsible for the first demonstration of this effect in optic spectroscopy by calculating energy levels of a system with the E-e problem. This effect is similar to the RTE, and the pseudo type of this is demonstrated in the stereochemical non-rigidity of molecules and ions as well as in fluxional behavior. This is most often encountered in octahedral complexes of the transition metals as well as six-coordinate copper II complexes. For ten points, name this doubly-eponymous effect where non-linear molecules experience a geometrical distortion under certain conditions.

answer: {Paris} Symphonies [prompt on “{Haydn's symphonies}” or similar answers]

One of them features a Capriccio second movement that is marked largo, and it begins simply and slowly before an outburst of a repeated note motif in its Allegro spirituoso. According to Nikolaus Harnoncourt, another of them is actually a suite consisting of overture, gavotte, menuet, and contredanse, and its second movement Romance contains four variations based on a song that began “La gentile et jeune Lisette”. This one was supposedly played by Marie Antoinette as she awaited execution, a fact that may have given it its name. Another one features a last movement that sounds like a low bagpipe drone or the dancing titular animal. Commissioned by the Masonic lodge called Loge Olympique in 1784, for 10 points, name this group of six symphonies that include The Hen and The Bear by Joseph Haydn that are named for a city that is not London.
