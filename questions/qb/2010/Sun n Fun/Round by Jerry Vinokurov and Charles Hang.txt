answer: {sigmatropic rearrangements} [prompt on “{rearrangements}”]

The mechanism of one of these types of reactions was elucidated by tagging an allyl phenyl ether with carbon-14, resulting in the determination that that reaction was specific to which carbon of the allyl group was bonded to the ring. That type of this reaction is used to synthesize 4-pentenoate esters from enolates or silyl enol ehters of allylic esters, and is known as the Claisen variety. Depending on whether the moving group in these types of reactions remains associated with the same or different face, these reactions are classified as suprafacial or antarafacial. An example of this type of reaction occurring in 1,5-dienes according to the 3,3 mechanism is known as the Cope type of this reaction. For ten points, identify this class of reactions characterized by the migration of a group attached by its namesake bond to the terminus of an adjacent pi electron system.

answer: {Diode}

One variety of this type of device works because quantum mechanical tunneling causes an increase in voltage to result in a decrease in current. That variety is noteworthy for the small size of its key component, which is often about one hundred angstroms wide, and is known as the tunnel variety. Another type of this device works by being reversed biased, thus keeping the voltage close to a namesake voltage. That variety often used as a shunt voltage regulator is named after an American physicist who also has a namesake pinning. One common type of these devices uses materials with a direct band gap, and like all of these devices, consists of a semiconducting chip doped with impurities to create a P-N junction. Including Zener varieties, for 10 points, name this device which conducts electric current in one direction, the most famous type of which emits light.

answer: Paolo {Veronese}

Jean Paul Richter noted that one work by this painter features a noblewoman kneeling as the head of the title grouping before her sons and nephews, who play Alexander the Great and his friend Hephaiston. Richter explains that it promotes the lesson of magnanimity expressed that work by this painter, The Family of Darius. In addition to that work, this artist painted a work in which the title occurrence is dwarfed by three large arches and notably includes dogs, Huns, and drunken revelers; that work resulted in this paitner being accused of irreverence. This artist also created a work where a lamb is being butchered on a classical balcony where revelers party around a haloed figure staring at the observer. For 10 points, name this Venetian painter of The Feast in the House of Levi and Wedding at Cana.

answer: {deep inelastic scattering}

This experimental technique yields a measurement of two functions which are related to each other by the Callan-Gross relation. When this technique utilizes polarized particles, its results are analyzed using the Ellis-Jaffe sum rules, which yield a result sometimes known as the “proton spin crisis,” and in this technique, the rate of J/psi production can be used to infer the gluon energy distribution. In the high energy limit, the structure functions probed through this technique depend only on the ratio of energy transferred to the square of the four-momentum, a phenomenon known as Bjorken scaling. Performed by firing high energy leptons at hadronic targets, for ten points, identify this experimental technique which provides experimental evidence for the idea that hadrons are made up of quarks.

answer: {occasionalism}

Simon Foucher was one of the first who criticized this philosophical position in Critique of the Search for Truth, and its central concept may have originated with Louis de la Forge. It was advanced by Johann Clauberg in his treatise, "On the Joining of the Body and the Soul in Man," and a version of this philosophy was advanced in a work entitled True Metaphysics by Arnold Geulincx, who also built an ethical theory from it. Descartes explicitly rejected this philosophy in his Meditations quipping, "I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel," and its most famous advocate advanced it in works like 14 Dialogues on Metaphysics and On Religion and Search After Truth. For 10 points, identify this philosophy which claims God is the only efficient cause for all events, most famously expounded by Nicholas Malebranche.

answer: Singapore

The worst disaster to ever occur in this port came in 1978, when the Greek tanker Spyros exploded while docked at this port. This port can be defended from the air via the Tengah Air Base, and in 1961 this city was devastated by the so-called “squatter fire”, a result of the highly flammable shelters that this port's homeless population used. Early in its history, this port was embroiled in a scandal over government sponsorship of gambling, which resulted in the dismissal of its second governor, Major Farquhar. Tengku Hussein, the Sultan of Johor, ceded the land on which this port was built. This port was founded to compete with Dutch-held Malacca by Sir Stamford Raffles. For ten points, name this independent city-state at the tip of the Malay Peninsula.

answer: {dative} case

Arabic does not have distinct forms for this noun case, but instead uses the prefix “li”. In Classical Greek, this noun case can serve five different functions, including indicating the possessor of an object or the purpose of an action. In Latin third declension i-stem nouns, this case is marked by a long i, and its Latin third person reflexive pronoun was “sibi”. This noun case is one of two that has distinct forms in German but not in English. Romance languages like Spanish exhibit separate forms for this case only in pronouns, while in English this case is marked by the preposition “to” in front of a noun. For ten points, name this noun case used for indirect objects.

answer: {Bobby Orr's flying goal} [accept {Orr's goal against} the {St. Louis Blues} or similar until they are named]

This event was recently depicted in sculpture by Harry Weber, though the most famous depiction of this event is due to Ray Lussier. The man against whom this action was taken was a replacement for Jacques Plante, and this action was made possible partly by the fact that the man who carried it out had blocked a chip by Larry Keenan. This action was made possible when the man who committed it made contact with Noel Picard after the former had beaten goalie Glen Hall, and it occurred 40 seconds into the first overtime period of the fourth game in the Stanley Cup finals. Committed against the St. Louis Blues, for ten points, identify this action which enabled a sweep of the Blues by the Bruins and which was committed in iconic fashion by a Bruins defenceman.

answer: {Wernicke's} aphasia [accept “{aphasia}” before “{lemma process}” is {spoken} prompt afterwards]

In one model of this disorder, its dysfunctions are modeled as interruptions to the lemma process. Another model of this disorder links it to damage to the left middle temporal gyrus and posterior inferior temporal gyrus, which interrupts the processing stream linking representations from the superior temporal sulcus with those in the left angular gyrus. Those who suffer from this disorder exhibit preserved semantic priming, and the mechanism of this disorder may involve the deficit in the pathway from input phonemes to semantics or within semantic representations themselves. This disorder results from damage to the left temporal lobe and can result in logorrhea. For ten points, identify this disorder which, unlike conduction aphasia and Broca's aphasia leads to the inability to comprehend language and is named for its German discoverer.
