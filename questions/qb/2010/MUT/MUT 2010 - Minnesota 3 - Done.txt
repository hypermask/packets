In the measurement of this property, Taylor vortices are eliminated in "Cup and bob" instruments, and for ideal gases, this quantity scales with the three-halves power of relative temperature. It is related to thermal diffusivity by the Prandtl number. The drag force on a body is proportional to this quantity, the body's radius, and its velocity according to the Stokes law. Another form of this quantity is equal to the ration of the shear stress and the shear velocity, and the Reynolds number is inversely proportional to this quantity. Fluids for which this property is constant are called Newtonian. For 10 points, identify this property of fluids which describes their ability to resist flow.
