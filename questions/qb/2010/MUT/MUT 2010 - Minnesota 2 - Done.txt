Wilhelm Ostwald developed the "isolation method" for deducing these, which involves adding an excess amount of one reactant and assuming that the remainder of the components have a pseudo-constant effect.

answer: {photoelectric} effect

The probability of absorption via this effect is proportional to the cube of the atomic number and linearly with the mass density. An early observation of this effect was due to Heinrich Hertz, who observed stronger emissions from a spark gap in a dark box with a quartz lid compared to one with a glass lid. Robert Millikan's experiments with this effect gave the Planck's constant within 0.5% accuracy. It only occurs when the energy of the causative particles is greater than the work function of the target, and Albert Einstein won the Nobel prize for his work on this effect. For 10 points, identify this effect that sees the emission of charged particles from materials when high-frequency light is shone on them.
