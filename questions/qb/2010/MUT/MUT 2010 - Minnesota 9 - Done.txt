answer: {DNA} [or {deoxyribonucleic acid}]

One method of determining certain modifications of this substance involves treating it with bisulfite, and a type of bonding named for Hoogsteen is sometimes observed in this substance. The binding of proteins to this substance can be studied via footprinting assays, and proteins which bind to this substance usually contain structures such as zinc-finger domains and leucine zippers. Chargaff's observations helped interpret the bonding of its constituent parts. For 10 points, identify this substance composed of thymine, adenine, cytosine, and guanine, which is located in the nucleus and which can be transcribed to give RNA.

answer: {Young's} modulus

In beam theory, the bending moment is given by this quantity times the moment of inertia times the curvature of the beam. The limit to which this quantity can be applied is squared and divided by twice this quantity to give the resilience. The quantity 1 plus Poisson's ratio times twice the shear modulus gives this quantity, and it can be used over ranges where the stress is less than the yield strength. According to the generalized Hooke's law, this tensor quantity is the ratio between the uniaxial stress and uniaxial strain, and can thus be found from the slope of a stress-strain curve. For 10 points, identify this quantity which has units of pressure and which describes the stiffness of a material.

The magnitude of this condition is measured by Theil's index which relies on entropy theory and by the Atkinson index which relies on the equity-sensitive average income. Okun acknowledged the existence of "leaky buckets" which decreased the efficiencies of programs that sought to decrease this. Kuznets' hypothesis suggests that this undergoes a U shape curve in a developing economy, and its magnitude is also given by the Robin Hood index. The area to the right of the 45 degree line, called the Gini coefficient, is one method of describing this condition, and it is depicted graphically via the Lorentz curve. For 10 points, identify this condition in which individuals have a differential amount of wealth.

answer: ideal gas law

An alternative method of stating this law is that its namesake substances must have a compressibility factor of unity. Deviations from it tend to zero at a temperature named for Boyle, at which the first order approximation to the virial equation is equivalent to this statement. It assumes that particles of the namesake substances have zero volume, participate in perfectly elastic collisions, and have no intermolecular attractions; those assumptions were first corrected for by the van der Waals equation of state.  For 10 points, identify this law which states that certain substances can be described by the equation of state PV=nRT.
