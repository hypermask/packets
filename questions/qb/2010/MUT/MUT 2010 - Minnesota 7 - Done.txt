answer: {acetic acid} [accept {CH3COOH}]

In the Woodward cis-hydroxylation, an alkene is converted into a diol using this compound as the solvent. The industrial synthesis of this compound occurs via the "insertion" of a CO moiety into a methanol molecule from a syn-gas mixture, and is catalyzed by a ruthenium-iridium complex; that procedure was pioneered by British Petroleum, and replaced the rhodium-based Monsanto process. August Kolbe demonstrated its synthesis from carbon disulfide. When it is free of water, it is referred to as its "glacial" form, and bacteria of the genus acetobacter produce this compound by the oxidation of ethanol. For 10 points, identify this compound which is found in low concetrations in vinegar.
