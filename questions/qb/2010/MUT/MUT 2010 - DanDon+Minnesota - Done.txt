answer: power

In statistics, this term describes the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is indeed false, or the probability of not committing a type II error; that quantity, which increases with sample size, is given by 1 minus beta. The square of the modulus of a Fourier transform gives the "spectrum" of this type, and the inverse fourier transform of that spectrum gives the autocorrelation function. In optics, this quantity has units called diopters which have dimensions of inverse length.  In physics, this quantity is equal to the rate of energy dissipation, and is given by an object's force times its velocity. For 10 points, identify this quantity which is given in terms of watts.

The use of difference in these entities to create meaning in Proto-Indo-European is called ablaut. “Clusters” lack them, and one follows a cluster and a glide in units characterized by Sievers' law. If one of them follows the second aspirate in a word, the first aspirate is lost by Grassman's law. “Strident” ones are characterized by an epiglottal trill. “Rhotic” ones occur when they follow the letter “R.” The “gliding” variety of them occurs when they change quality during pronunciation, in which case they are called diphthongs. For 10 points, name these sounds that underwent a “great shift” in English, where examples of them include “A,” “E,” and sometimes “Y.”

answer: {nitrogen fixation} [prompt on {nitrogen reduction} or equivalents]

The Azolla ferns form symbiotic relationships with Anabaena cyanobacteria to help the ferns in this process, and some cyanobacteria used specialized structures called heterocysts to perform it. Nif genes code for the enzymes which accomplish this process in bacteria, and those complexes have an iron-molybdenum enzyme which transfers 6 electrons by consuming 12 ATP. It is most commonly performed by plants which have bacteria called Rhizobia in their root nodules. On the industrial scale, this is accomplished with the help of an iron catalyst and is co-named for Carl Bosch. For 10 points, identify this process which sees the reduction of a certain element from its oxidized form into ammonia.
