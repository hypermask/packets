answer: {polymers} [do not accept or prompt on "{monomers}"]

One of the most accurate thermodynamic models describing them is the FJC model, and in that model, they can be thought of as various segments whose dimension is the Kuhn length. Another thermodynamic theory developed by Flory and Huggins describes their interactions in solvents. "Block" varieties of these are simply two or more different ones of these which are covalently bonded, and reactions in which these substances are produced from free radicals have initiation, propagation, and termination steps.  For 10 points, identify these substances which are composed of several building blocks, examples of which include polyethylene and polypropylene.

answer: {fatty acids} [prompt on {fats}; accept {long chain carboxylic acids} or equivalents]

The rate limiting step in the synthesis of these compounds is the formation of malonyl-coA from acetyl coA. That reaction is catalyzed by a complex containing beta-keto acyl synthetase and the acyl carrier peptide. Prior to oxidation, these compounds are transferred to the mitochondria via a carnitine intermediate. Methyl esters of these compounds are often utilized as biodiesel, and triglycerides consist of a glycerol backbone which is esterified with three of these compounds. For 10 points, identify these substances, which have a carboxylate group and a long aliphatic chain, whose "omega-6" and "omega-3" variants are consumed as dietary supplements.

answer: {piezoelectricity} [accept {piezoelectric effect}]

Woldemar Voigt developed a set of tensor equations to describe the linear behavior of materials exhibiting this effect, and a rank-3 tensor with 18 coefficients is used to describe materials with this property. Titanate salts of barium and lead are used in microphones because they exhibit this property, and Langevin developed a submarine detector that relied on this effect. This effect occurs in materials lacking a centre of symmetry and has an inverse effect called electrostriction. It was first observed by the Curie brothers in their studies of Rochelle salts. For 10 points identify this effect which sees the production of current in response to the application of a mechanical stress.

answer: {curvature} [accept {torsion} until mentioned]

The Frenet-Serret formulae relate torsion and this quantity to a set of three vectors. One type of this quantity is given as the determinant of the shape operator and is the product of the two "principal" values of this. The "intrinsic" type of it is undetectable to observers who are not on the manifold, and is exemplified by the Gaussian type of this quantity, while the Ricci and Reimann tensors also describe this property. The "extrinsic" type is defined as the derivative of the tangent angle with respect to the arclength at a point.  This quantity is the inverse of the radius of the osculating circle associated with a curve. For 10 points, identify this quantity which roughly describes how much a plane or a line is bent.
