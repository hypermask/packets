answer: Adolph {Fick's} Laws of diffusion

Their formulator confirmed the predictions of these relations by showing that a non-linear profile of specific gravity versus distance was obtained for water when it was placed in flasks containing sodium chloride with varying funnel areas. One of these expressions is analogous to Fourier's law of heat conduction. The second of these relations can be obtained by substituting the first into the continuity equation, and the first one describes the linear dependence of mass flux on the molar average velocity of the species. For 10 points, identify these laws which relate the diffusive flux to a phenomenological diffusion coefficient, and which were developed after Graham's law of effusion.

answer: {Davisson Germer} experiment

It wasn't performed by Rutherford, but this experiment was independently verified by George Thomson, who observed weak edges of an Airy disk. The detector in this experiment was a Faraday box that measured a peak intensity at a 50 degree angle, and it utilized particles which were accelerated in a 54 volt potential. Its setup involved the firing of electrons at a crystalline nickel target, and its results showed that the diffraction pattern obeyed Bragg's law, and thus confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis of wave particle duality. For 10 points, identify this experiment which was performed by two Americans working for Bell Labs.

answer: {microtubules}

CLASP proteins bind one end of these structures and help inhibit a process called "catastrophe." These structures can have persistence lengths of 3-4 mm, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the average cellular diameter. These structures can be severed by katanin. Drugs such as paclitaxel stabilize these structures and prevent their depolymerization, where colchicine prevents its dimeric subunits from coming together. Shortening of these structure at the kinetochore ends of the spindle apparatus helps chromosomes walk towards poles during mitosis and meiosis. For 10 points, identify these structures which are components of the cytoskeleton and which are made of tubulin proteins.
