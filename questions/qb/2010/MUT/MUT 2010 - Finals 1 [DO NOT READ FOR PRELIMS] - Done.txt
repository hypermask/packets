answer: {mass spectrometry} [accept {mass spec}]

In one form of this technique, Sinapinic acid and CCA form a matrix in which the analytes are embedded after zip tipping. That form sees a laser fire a beam at the matrix, after which the sample vaporizes and picks up a proton. In another form, the analytes are passed through volatile compounds like acetonitrile, and a high voltage causes the solution to form fine droplets. The former technique is the MALDI variant, while the latter technique is called electrospray ionization. The peak with the highest intensity is called the "base peak" and the early methods of performing it involved firing electrons at the sample. For 10 points, identify this technique which gives information about the ratio of a namesake quantity to charge.

answer: {Pauli} exclusion principle

This statement implies that for the liquid drop model, isotopes with unequal numbers of protons and neutrons will have a lower binding energy that decreases with the square of the number difference. This statement can be mathematically represented by determinants composed of spin orbitals, which change sign upon permutation of rows. Another consequence of it is the electron degeneracy pressure that supports the formation of white dwarfs, and it implies that electrons occupying the same orbital must have opposite spins. For 10 points, identify this statement which implies that no two fermions can possess the same quantum numbers, developed by an Austria physicist.
