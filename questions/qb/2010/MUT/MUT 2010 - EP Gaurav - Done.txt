answer: {activation} energy

In electromigration theory, the median failure time is function of this quantity and current density according to Black's equation. In food processing engineering, it is proportional to the square of the mean temperature divided by a thermal "resistance constant." This quantity expresses the fact that the rate constant of a reactant is temperature dependent, since it is proportional to the derivative of the rate constant with respect to inverse temperature. It is often represented as a hump in a graph plotting the rate of reaction versus time. Catalysts speed up reactions by reducing this quantity. For 10 points, name this quantity that gives the minimum energy required in a system for a reaction to occur.
