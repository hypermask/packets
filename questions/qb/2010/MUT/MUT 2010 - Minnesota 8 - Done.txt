answer: {glycolysis} [accept {Embden}-{Meyerhoff pathway}]

The end product of this pathway is decarboxylated by TPP and transferred onto a lipoic acid arm after which it is released as a thioester, and the fact that cancer cells primarily utilize this pathway was observed by Otto Warburg. A hexokinase performs the first committed step in this pathway by phosphorylating the initial substrate. The production of DHAP and G3P in this pathway is catalyzed by an aldolase, while an irreversible sees the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase. For 10 point, identify this process which sees the production of 2 pyruvate molecules from 1 glucose molecule, and whose name reflects the fact that glucose is broken down in it.

answer: {paramagnetism} [accept word forms]

The SBM theory attempts to describe enhanced nuclear relaxation in NMR in the presence of dissolved ionic species with this property; in that theory, ions with this property contribute unpaired electron density to enhance relaxation. Zavoisky discovered the resonant absorption of microwaves by materials exhibiting this property in a constant field, which is the underlying principle of electron spin resonance. It is exhibited by materials with a positive magnetic susceptibility, and is often observed in materials with unpaired electrons, exemplified by liquid oxygen. For 10 points, identify this behavior which occurs when a material becomes weakly magnetized in a parallel orientation to the applied magnetic field.

The fact that a parameter commonly analyzed in this discipline  is downward biased towards zero if orthogonality is violated is called the "iron law" of this discipline. "Within-differencing," "first-differencing," and "long-differencing" are methods of panel analysis in this discipline. The "probabilistic approach" towards this discipline was pioneered by Trygve Haavelmo, and Ragnar Frisch is considered the founder of this discipline.

This substance is subjected to the chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand tests, and measurements of its quality include TSS and TDS. One property of this substance can be tested for by a circular disk divided into black-and-white quarter-segments and mounted on a pole, a device called a Secchi Disk. Thermal differences in this material can result in different concentrations of carbon dioxide in different layers of it, which can cause a CO2 eruption to occur.
