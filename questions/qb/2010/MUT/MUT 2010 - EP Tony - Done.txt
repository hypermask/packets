answer: {neutrino}

The mass matrix of these particles has an eigenvalue on the Dirac scale, and another eigenvalue on the Majorana scale; the balance between those eigenvalues explains the seesaw mechanism for their unusual properties. A sine-squared of 2 theta term and a square of mass difference term are found in the equation which predicts the probability density of their flavors; the switching of these particles between flavors is called their namesake "oscillation." They were first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli, who sought to explain the violation of energy conservation in beta decay. For 10 points, identify these particles which come in the "electron," "muon," and "tau" varieties, and which are known to be extremely light.

The HeliScope technology performs this activity using single molecule samples, and the Phred program assigns quality scores to the ouput of this process. Examples of this activity which rely on the SOLiD technology include one in which the release of a PPi group causes luciferase to oxidize luciferin and release light.  Sanger's chain termination method is a "wet" method of performing it, while an early method of performing this activity with large samples was the "shotgun method" which relied on cloning of random portions of the chromosome.
