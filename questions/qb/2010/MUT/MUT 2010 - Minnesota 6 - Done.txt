Every one-percent increase in this quantity corresponds to a two-percent loss in potential GDP in the “gap version” of Okun's law. Keynes's attacks of Pigou's work about a “theory” of it led Pigou to formulate the “real balance effect” whereby a rise in this quantity leads to a drop in prices, which eventually results in this quantity becoming zero.
