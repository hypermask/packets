answer: {integral transforms} [accept {Abel transform}, {Weierstrass transform}, {Fourier transform where appropriate}]

One of this type of operation is used to effect a time-step on a temperature distribution on an infinite rod and employs a Gaussian with exponent coefficient one over four t; that one is named for Weierstrass. These operations employ a function of two variables, one a dummy, called the “kernel function” or “nucleus”; the kernel is two t over square root of t squared minus u squared for the Abel one. One of these operations is unitary according to Parseval's theorem and moves from the time domain to the frequency domain. For 10 points, name this type of map which uses its namesake operation to take a function to another function, one example of which is named for Fourier.

Polymerization in one type of these entities was first modeled by Smith, Ewart, and Hawkins. These entities exhibit maximum viscosity at their point of zero charge.
