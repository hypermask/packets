answer: {Anna Fierling} [or {Mother Courage}]

This character insists that a cook purchase and prepare a capon that “would only feed to music—one march in particular was its favorite.” Earlier, this character sells a silver-chased belt for half a guilder while claiming it is worth two and sings “what fires that blood is my red meat” in a song used to peddle boots and food. This character's nickname recalls an incident in which she drove through gunfire in Riga to sell loaves of bread to soldiers, and in an attempt to warn her, her child dies while beating a drum.

Jasper Johns's Racing Thoughts and Kaspar Malevich's Solar Eclipse with [this work] both feature recreations of it, the former in black and white and the latter with two red Xs. Fernand Leger created a version “with keys,” while E.H. Gombrich pointed out the distinctive sfumato at the corners of the eyes. Margaret Livingstone claimed that this painting's most famous feature is captivating because it is not perceptible by foveal vision and thus nearly disappears when it is looked at directly. Featuring an added mustache in Duchamp's parody L.H.O.O.Q., for 10 points, name this painting famous for its subject's lack of eyebrows and enigmatic smile, a portrait by Leonardo da Vinci.

answer: Jurgen {Habermas}

This thinker divided social formations into primitive, traditional, and liberal-capitalist categories in a work that labeled social crises as “unresolved economic steering problems.” This author of Legitimation Crisis discussed the “dissolution of epistemology” in Knowledge and Human Interests. One of his works posits freedom, equality, and consensus must precede the universal validity required for discourse ethics. His most famous work proposes that coffeehouses developed in the eighteenth century to mediate the state and society.

answer: Panic of 1837

One incident during this event saw New Yorkers break into stores to steal barrels of grain. That incident was called the “Flour Riot.” Poor farm conditions in Britain led up to this event, which included a 75 percent drop in the price of cotton. It was instigated by an act issued by Levi Woodbury in an attempt to slow inflation and land speculation by requiring the purchase of land in gold or silver. The granting of surplus government funds to pet banks may have contributed to this event along with that act, the Specie Circular. For 10 points, name this financial crisis that occurred during the presidency of Martin van Buren.

One character in this work bathes in a pool of invincibility but closes his eyes, leaving them vulnerable to an arrow. Another character is kissed on his shoulders, where two black snakes who feed on human brains grow. One character castigates his horse until he realizes he is merely being warned of a dragon; that character defeats a demon disguised as an Onager and kills the White Demon. That character serves Kai Khosrow and undergoes seven labors in this work, which tells of wars with Afrasiab and the Turans and ends recounting the history of the Sassanids.

Despite being hit by fifteen separate shells during this battle, the ship Warspite managed to survive it. Hipper and Beatty fought each other at the “Run to the South” phase of this battle, during which the V4 and the Black Prince sank. Those commanders had learned from their earlier battle at Dogger Bank during the previous year.

Kusenko and Segre demonstrated that these particles could explain pulsar kicks. Taking the determinant of a matrix with elements zero, Dirac mass, Dirac mass, Majorana mass gives the mass of an as yet undiscovered form of this particle as the larger root by the “seesaw” mechanism. Warm dark matter may be composed of that “sterile” type of this particle, and the PMNS matrix predicts their flavor oscillations. They were first proposed by Wolfgang Pauli as a method of preserving conservation of mass and momentum in beta decay, and the Super-Kamiokande device detects them. For 10 points, name these leptons with tau, muon, and electron flavors.

answer: The {Egoist}

The prelude of this work notes that the title figure is “condemned to strip himself stark naked" as the form of pathos, but is not allowed to “rush at you, roll you over, and squeeze your body for the briny drops.” Character insights in this novel often come from Mrs. Mountstuard-Jenkinson, while its main action begins when Harry Oxford begins giving it to Constantia Durham, terminating her engagement to the title character. Vernon Whitford's education of  Crossjay occupies much of the novel, and Clara Middleton contemplates marrying the protagonist, who is rejected by Laetitia Dale.

answer: alkenols

A lactone of this functionality is the starting point of the Fujimoto-Belleau reaction, and acetyl CoA in this form adds to a protein-bound carboxylate chain in fatty acid synthesis. Silyl ethers of this type are used in a pair of reactions developed by Teruaki Mukaiyama. These compounds are the initial result of the oxy-Cope rearrangement. Reagents used to form the conjugate base of this functionality include KHMDS and LDA. A rare example of one of these compounds being more stable than its keto tautomer is phenol. For 10 points, name this functional group consisting of an alkene with a hydroxyl group on an sp2 carbon.

This work's narrator recalls first seeing the main character's family being driven to church by a wild-eyed slave. One character tells his fifteen-year-old mistress, “Too bad you're not a mare like Penelope. Then I would give you a decent stall in the stable” because she had borne him a daughter, not a son. That man had cheated a Chickasaw chief out of a hundred acres of land and married Ellen as part of his “design” for greatness. Rosa helps explain why Henry killed Charles Bon rather than let him marry Judith to this book's narrator, Quentin Compson. For 10 points, name this novel about Thomas Sutpen, one of many works set in Yoknapatawpha County by William Faulkner.

A series of four-note sequences, beginning with an accented forte chord, climax in a fortissimo in this piece's seventeenth measure. Its rhythms have been described as combinations of dactyls and spondees, while the coda of its first movement features an unusually chromatic bass passage. An allegretto theme and variations in A minor forms its second movement. A shift from the home key to C major, F major, and back from the home key shapes its long poco sostenuto introductory passage, which has no slow movement and which Wagner called “the Apotheosis of the Dance.” For 10 points, name this symphony in A major that followed its composer's “Pastoral” sixth.

answer: {ATP synthase}

One experiment to investigate this enzyme used nickel-binding histidine residues to affix one end of it to a glass surface and allow researchers to observe a rotating actin filament bonded to its other end. Its beta subunits can assume three different configurations with different binding affinities for its substrate, and this enzyme is inhibited by compounds like oligomycin and vancomycin. This enzyme's alpha/beta hexamer and gamma “stalk” comprise its F1 complex, and a, b, and c subunits comprise its F0 complex. This enzyme's action is driven by proton flow across the mitochondrial membrane. For 10 points, name this enzyme that adds an inorganic phosphate group to ADP.

A formation-based classification of these entities is due to Lucas and Howarth. One type of them with high sand concentration in Sweden is called Veiki, and another class of these structures is named for De Geer. Flow over a sandur is channelized when the snout has retreated from one type of this structure. Large, rippled ridges characterize the Rogen type. Irregularities in a glacier's retreat lead to the “recessional” type. Norway's Giant's Wall is an example of the “terminal” type, while side basin shearing gives lateral ones. They are composed of an undifferentiated mix of rock and soil called till. For 10 points, name these rock deposits left by glaciers.
