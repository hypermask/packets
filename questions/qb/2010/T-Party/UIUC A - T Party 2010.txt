answer: {methylenation} [accept equivalents like {adding} a {methylene group}; accept {adding} a {CH2 group} before “{CH2}” and prompt on it afterwards; prompt on {making} a {terminal olefin}; prompt on {alkylation}]

This operation can be accomplished using a bis-iodozincio compound in the absence of metal salts in an ionic liquid as a single substitution, or via the reaction of formaldehyde to a malonic ester in the presence of an amine, a reaction named for Knoevenagel. Using a compound with two cyclopentadiene ligands, a titanium carbenoid, this operation occurs as a single substitution at a carbonyl in the Tebbe olefination. The group added in this reaction is named for how it would appear following homolytic cleavage, a neutral one-carbon species with two unpaired electrons; that group is the simplest carbene. For 10 points, name this type of reaction in which a CH2 group is attached.

answer: {selection rules} [prompt on {transition rules}]

In general, these statements can be found by inspection by considering that the symmetry of the integrand in the transition integral is the direct product of the symmetries of the transition moment operator, and the conjugate-initial and final wave functions, as that symmetry dictates when that integral is zero. For hydrogen-like atoms one of these exists for all multipoles against the case in which the initial and final states have zero total angular momentum; consequently, transitions between such states do not occur. Transitions subject to one of these are known as allowed or forbidden. For 10 points, name these quantum mechanical strictures that dictate when a transition is possible.

answer: {vortex} [or {vorticity}]

The Strouhal number governs flow that arises due to these phenomena. Helmholtz is the namesake of three theorems that concern the physical shape of these objects, and when these objects possess no shear factor, their equation of motion shows that all points in them possess the same angular velocity. Theodore von Karman is the namesake of a sheet that shows how these objects can induce motion in fluids. For 10 points, name this phenomenon that is the namesake of a characteristic measured by taking the curl of the velocity of a fluid or taking circulation and dividing it by area, a fluid phenomenon that swirls.
