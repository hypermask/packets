answer: {cycloaddition} [prompt on {pericyclic reactions} before mention; prompt on {Diels}-{Alder reaction} before mention; prompt on {DeMayo reaction} before mention; prompt on {1,3 dipolar cycloaddition} before mention; prompt on {cheletropic reactions} until mention; prompt on any answer that {includes} the names {Suarez} and {Sordo throughout}]

An example of a subset of this type of reaction is the reaction of sulfur dioxide with butadiene, a cheletropic reaction. Photochemically induced examples include the DeMayo reaction. Many alkaloids are synthesized using the 1,3 dipolar variant of this subtype of pericyclic reactions, the [2+2] type of which is thermally forbidden. The endo product is preferred in the reaction of this type in which an alkene reacts with a conjugated diene to produce cyclohexene derivatives. The combination of unsaturated molecules to form a cyclic product with a reduction in bond multiplicity is, for 10 points, what kind of reaction exemplified by the Diels-Alder reaction?

answer: {Blood Wedding} [or {Bodas} de {Sangre}]

In this play, the lines "sleep rosebush" and "sleep carnation" follow mention of a lullaby, while one character drops orange blossoms a few days after hearing the neighing of another character's horse.

The mother of a main character wishes her son had been born a girl so that he would not “find death by gun or knife”. Act III features a discussion with three woodcutters and the entrance of both the Moon and Death.   Eventually, that groom meets death disguised as a beggar woman before fighting Leonardo Felix to the death. For 10 points, name this play depicting the title event, a work of Federico Garcia Lorca.

Elias Unger, the president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, tried unsuccessfully to prevent it. Further adding to the chaos was a fire that began at the Stone Bridge. The first major relief effort for Clara Barton's Red Cross, this event was determined to be an “act of God,” although many blamed Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie's resort club for lowering the South Fork Dam.

answer: {spleen}

This organ produces the tetrapeptide threonine-lysine-proline-arginine, known as tuftsin, and one part of it expresses a receptor with “collagenous structure” called MARCO. This structure is enlarged in Banti's syndrome. Sheaths around blood vessels in this structure are known as PALS. Unlike most of the gut, this organ forms from mesenchymal tissue, and this organ contains the cords of Billroth. This organ's marginal zone separates its red and white pulp; the former contains around half of the body's monocytes, and the later makes antibodies. Enlarged in mono, for 10 points, name this organ that filters the blood and lymph.

answer: {strong nuclear} force [or {strong} interaction; accept early {lattice QCD}; do not accept “{color force}”]

Wilson loops arise in a computationally tractable model of this force that uses a lattice to simplify path integrals. In one context, this force obeys a screened Coulomb potential named for Hideki Yukawa and operates via meson exchange, its “residual” form. Separating particles bound by this interaction, which is modeled by the SU(3) group, requires enough energy to form particle-antiparticle pairs that bind to the original particles, meaning that those particles are never free, a phenomenon known as confinement. This force becomes weak at small distances and binds quarks with gluons. For 10 points, name this fundamental force, the most powerful of the four.

answer: {Diophantine} equations
