A triphenyl derivative of it is used alond with DEAD in the Mitsunobu reaction, and a reagent often used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl bromides is this element's pentabromide. Most of the body's supply of this element comes in a mineral of calcium and this element called apatite. Allotropes of this element include the chain-like red and the tetrahedral white, and the Wittig reaction requires a ylide containing this element.

answer: {mantle}

Schilling's ridge-sink model describes phenomena here, and convection cells here exhibit “soft turbulence.” The carrot shape of kimberlite pipes owes to their origin in this region. Studies of mid-ocean-ridge basalts suggest its convection occurs only in two layers. This structure may contain a post-perovskite phase where P-waves attenuate in its D-double-prime layer. A velocity discontinuity in this region is named for Inge Lehmann. Its upper limit is named for Mohorovicic [moh-oh-ROH-vee-chihch], which separates its uppermost layer, the asthenosphere, from the crust. For 10 points, name this plastic layer of the earth's interior between crust and core.

answer: {resonance} [or {delocalization} of electrons]

Examples of this property include the norbornyl cation and diborane's three-center two-electron bonds, and this phenomenon's greater strength as stability decreases makes it more active in excited states, allowing dyes to function. This property's effect on the electron donating or withdrawing character of a group is called the mesomeric effect, and its stabilization energy is named for Dewar. Molecules with this property include the carboxylate ion, which has two bonds of order three halves, and they are shown as a hybrid of Lewis structures.
