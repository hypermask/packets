answer: {serine} [or {serine protease}]

One member of a class of molecules named for this residue has a neutrophil form that breaks down the outer coat of Gram-negative bacteria. The transport of another member of that class named for this residue is deficient in cystic fibrosis, leading to myconium ileus; those members are elastase and trypsin. This residue donates a proton to a histidine residue, which accepts a hydrogen bond from aspartic acid, allowing its hydroxyl group to act as a nucleophile in the “catalytic triad” characteristic of a family of proteases named for this residue. For 10 points, name this amino acid with a hydroxy-methyl sidechain.

answer: CMBR [or {cosmic} microwave {background radiation}]

It displays a gravitational redshift that occurs either as particles enter and exit potential wells that stretch over time or at the surface of last scattering. Below about 218 gigahertz, its intensity falls due to interactions with high-energy electrons in an effect used to find galaxy clusters. Those phenomena cause anisotropies in this entity, once studied by COBE and now by WMAP. This phenomenon has a thermal black-body spectrum equivalent to about with a peak frequency of 160.2 gigahertz, giving a temperature of two point seven Kelvin. For 10 points, name this ubiquitous electromagnetic phenomenon, named for the part of the spectrum where it shows up, the residue of the Big Bang.

A “deep” form of scattering that has this characteristic uses high-energy electrons to probe hadrons, confirming that they are composed of quarks. A process of this type results in a blue or red wavelength shift termed Stokes and anti-Stokes lines in Raman scattering, and high-frequency photons interact with matter and increase in wavelength in a process of this type. This property results when a collision generates heat or requires deformation, and when this condition is total, two objects often stick together. For 10 points, give this adjective describing a collision in which kinetic energy is not conserved.
