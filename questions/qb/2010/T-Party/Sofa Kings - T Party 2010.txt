answer: tumor protein {p53}

This protein is ubiquitinated by Mdm2, and ubiquitin can be cleaved from it by USP7. This protein forms a complex with Bcl-xL that is disrupted by a protein called PUMA. HPV infection leads to the production of an inactivator of this protein called E6. This protein tetramerizes via its C-terminal domain, allowing it to bind DNA. Mutations in this protein can lead to Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and it activates the transcription of the WAF1 gene, which binds to CDK2. This protein can trigger DNA repair in case of damage and can halt the cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint. For 10 points, name this protein which initiates apoptosis and protects against cancerous growth in the body.

answer: {gas}-{liquid chromatography}

Methods for using this procedure's “inverse” form to find solid surface energy were developed by Dorris and Gray and by Schultz. This procedure's results can be summarized for a pair of compounds as a Kovats index. Common detectors for this procedure include hot wire detectors and flame ionization detectors. Some devices used for this technique have walls coated with a progression of stationary phases. The retention time in this technique depends on boiling point and solubility, both of which affect its partitioning behavior with the mobile and stationary phases. For 10 points, name this type of procedure where the vaporized analyte is separated and often carried through by helium.

Karpa and Weitz carried out a version of this experiment on polaritons, quasiparticles that model slow light. This experiment is mimicked by population inversion in a MASER. Employing an extension of this experiment's apparatus led I. I. Rabi to discover his eponymous oscillation. The results of this experiment accorded with the later hypothesis of Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit. This experiment featured a nonuniform magnetic field that deflected a beam of silver atoms, giving two beams rather than a continuous distribution.
