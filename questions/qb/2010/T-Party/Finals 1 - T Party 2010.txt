answer: {nitriles}

The Kuwajima synthesis of Taxol used a diethylaluminum compound to get to this functional group from a ketone. A partial solvolysis of this functionality is named for Pinner, and amides and this functional group form from an aldehyde and azide in the Schmidt reaction. These react with benzene derivatives to give imines because of their electronic similarity to acylium cations. Phosphorus pentachloride reacts with amides to give these. Aryl ones are made from halides in the Rosenmund-von Braun reaction, and alkyl ones in the Kolbe synthesis. For 10 points, name this functional group whose simplest example is cyanide, with a carbon triple-bonded to nitrogen.

answer: Battle of {Shiloh} [accept {Pittsburg Landing} until mentioned)]

One controversy during this battle was the tardy appearance of General Lew Wallace, who had led his troops down the wrong road. Near the end of this battle, the losing side's calvary under Nathan Bedford Forrest mounted a wild counter-charge at a site called “Fallen Timbers.” P.G.T. Beauregard took command of the losing side after his superior, Albert Sidney Johnston, was slain. This battle saw sieges of the Union positions at the Hornet's Nest and later at Pittsburg Landing, which is an alternate name for this battle. For 10 points, name this key 1862 victory for Ulysses S. Grant in southwestern Tennessee, the bloodiest two-day battle of the Civil War.

answer: Alexander Nikolayevich {Scriabin}

One of this man's works is marked “mysterious” and “concentrated” and features a number of interruptions marked “surge of terror”. A hand injury inspired the dark F-minor key of his first piano sonata, while his first symphony ends with a paean to the glory of art. The phrase “with a heavenly delight” marks the recurring theme of his White Mass Sonata, while the movements of his third symphony are “Struggles”, “Delights”, and “Divine Play”. His “Mystic chord” features in his apocalyptic unfinished Mysterium, while he used a clavier à lumières for a similarly synesethetic work. For 10 points, name this composer of The Divine Poem and Prometheus: The Poem of Fire.

answer: pions

A baryon state that decays into a delta baryon and one of these, or one or two nucleons and one of these, is the Roper resonance. The energy of cosmic rays is bounded at around five times ten to the nineteen eV because collisions with CMB photons would produce these particles at higher energies. These particles are the standard triplet representation of SU(2) isospin symmetry. One type of these usually decays into a muon and its neutrino, and the other usually forms two photons or can form a photon, electron, and positron in Dalitz decay. Its charged versions are the up antidown and the down antiup. For 10 points, name these first-generation mesons, the lightest.

answer: {Theodor Adorno}

One work by this thinker rejects idealism since it prioritizes to the “epistemic subject” and claims that suffering is “objectivity that weighs on [that] subject”. That work also discards Kant's distinction between noumena and phenomena in favor of a fluid “non-incidental” experience. Another book that this thinker contributed to contains an excursus that labels de Sade's Juliette a Carsteian dualist. That work examines the “mass deception” of the title concept and the deliberate commodification of art in the section “The Culture Industry”.

answer: {gluconeogenesis} [or {gng}]

This process has an enzyme that converts bicarbonate to carbon dioxide and then binds and transfers it as carboxyl; that enzyme has a biotinyl-lysine swinging arm motif.

answer: {convergence}

Egorov's theorem relates two types of this property for measurable functions. A theorem named for Vitali applies when a dominating function cannot be found; when one can, Lebesgue's dominated this theorem applies. This property also makes Fatou's lemma reduce to that theorem. The pointwise type of this property is weaker than the uniform type. On the complex plane, this condition's equivalent is named for Cauchy, since there, it's possible for each element past some point to be arbitrarily close, without approaching a unique value. For 10 points, name this property lacked by the partial sums of the harmonic series, which requires that a sequence has a limit.

answer: {protein sequencing}

One method for accomplishing this employs a Curtius rearrangement followed by the hydrogenolysis of the resulting benzyl carbamate. This process can benefit from labeling with Sanger's reagent or dansyl chloride. One method for accomplishing this ends each step with the cleavage of a thiazolinone; that adduct resulted from the reaction of phenylisothiocyanate with the N-terminal residue; those processes are the Bergmann and Edman degradations. Anfinsen's hypothesis suggests that determining this allows the reconstruction of tertiary structure. For 10 points, name this process through which the primary structure of a polypeptide is determined.
