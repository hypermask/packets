answer: {viscosity}

For a dilute gas, this quantity is proportional to the square root of the product of mass and temperature, divided by collision diameter squared times the collision integral. This quantity scales from a reference temperature, for an ideal gas, as the square root of temperature. Those results are the Chapman-Enskog equation and Sutherland's formula.

This quantity, the ratio of shear stress to shear velocity, is zero for Newtonian fluids, and superfluidity occurs when this quantity is zero.
