Glauconite is a mineral of this type, though it lacks a characteristic property, and the "windows" which allow weak forms of radiation to pass through Geiger counters are usually made of these minerals. "Bird's eye" patterns are exhibited by two of these minerals when placed under cross-polarized light. One type of these minerals is a lithium source, lepidolite, and another has a chromium-rich variant called fuchsite and gets its name because of its use in Russian glass. Containing such minerals as biotites and muscovites, for 10 points, identify these phyllosilicate minerals, many of which exhibit perfect basal cleavage.

answer: anaphase

The onset of this event is regulated by levels of RCS1, and a complex key to this event is activated by the Cdc20 cofactor. This event proceeds when a complex alternatively called the cyclosome degrades securins, leading to the activation of separases which cleave residual cohesin; that complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the APC/C. Spindle poles begin to move apart during the later part of this stage, and its early portion sees the shortening of microtubules due to depolymerization at the plus ends. For 10 points, identify this event in which sister chromatids begin to move towards opposite poles of the cell, a stage of mitosis which precedes telophase.

answer: {enthalpy} [prompt on {H}]

Vertical lines on Mollier diagrams display transformations in which this quantity is unchanged. This quantity remains constant for a system in a throttling process. The van't Hoff equation states that the derivative of the natural log of the equilibrium constant with respect to inverse temperature is equal to negative change in this quantity divided by the ideal gas constant. For transformations occurring at constant pressure, it is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, and the product of temperature and change in entropy subtracted from change in it is the change in the Gibbs energy of a reaction. For 10 points, identify this thermodynamic quantity symbolized H.

answer: {punctuated equilibrium}

The Bak-Sneppen model incorporates self organized criticality in an attempt to explain this hypothesis, and Geliser and Walker attempted to explain the existence of homochiral biological molecules in the light of this theory. The paper in which it was introduced began with a discussion of a passage by N. R. Hanson regarding the "cloven hoofprint of theory." It was proposed as an interpretation of the stability of morphospecies, and it suggests that periods of stasis are interspersed with cladogenic events. It contrasts with the theory of phyletic gradualism. For 10 points, identify this theory which suggests that evolution happens in bursts rather than proceeding at a linear rate.
