answer: {Raoult's} law

Along with the Gibbs-Kelvin relation, this relation appears as a b over R cubed term in the Kohler equation that relates saturation in cloud condensation nuclei. The first practical application of it was determining molecular weights of compounds through a differential thermometer developed by Ernst Beckmann.

Similar to a law stating that the pressure of a gas is proportional to the concentration of a gas, for 10 points, name this law which states that the vapor pressure of a solvent is proportional to the mole fraction of a solute.

answer: {peptidoglycan}

Autolysins effect the breakdown of this substance, and bactoprenol transfers its monomers. Pentaglycine structures crosslink alanine-glutamine-lysine-alanine chains in this substance. It is composed of alternating N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues, and those tetrapeptide chains have unusual stereochemistry. Its beta-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds are hydrolyzed by lysozyme.

For 10 points, identify this substance found in bacterial cell walls, which contains both sugar residues and amino acids.
