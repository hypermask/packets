answer: Edvard Hagerup {Grieg}

A work by this man “battles” against a Tchaikovsky work played by the orchestra in Franz Reizenstein's Concerto Popolare. One of his works features a march for the clarinets and bassoons in the third movement and opens with a timpani roll and a solo flourish; that work takes its key from a similar work by Schumann. Another of his works opens with a piece called “Arietta” and contains his “Wedding Day at Troldhaugen”. For 10 points, identify this composer of a Piano Concerto in A minor and the Lyric Pieces, who wrote “Anitra's Dance”, “Morning Mood”, and “In the Hall of the Mountain King” for his incidental music to Ibsen's Peer Gynt.

answer: angular {momentum}

The spherical harmonics have eigenvalue h-bar2 l (l + 1) under this operator's square. The commutator for operators representing two components of this quantity is plus or minus i h-bar times the operator for its third component. Slater determinants are used to force fermion wavefunctions to be asymmetric as required by one type of this quantity. Hyperfine structure results from one interaction involving this quantity, as does Russell-Saunders coupling and the splitting of signals in NMR. Expanding this quantity in the uncoupled basis requires Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. For 10 points, name this quantity equal to the product of inertial moment and angular velocity.

One work by this thinker contrasts the social experience of “normals” to those who possess tribal, bodily, or moral discrepancies between their virtual and actual social identities. This thinker compared the medicalization of mental illness to the mechanical repair of clocks and a described how certain social roles were reinforced by the titular “total institution” in another work. This author of Stigma also claimed that appearances and interactions are “stage-managed” in a work that outlined his dramaturgical analysis. 10 points, name this author of Asylums, a sociologist who wrote The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.

John Hakac claimed that this poem's “organically complete” third stanza contains “three distinct phases of love”. Its speaker makes a comparison to “a magic lantern” which “threw the nerves in patterns on a screen” and describes “the voices dying with a dying fall / Beneath the music from a farther room”. Its speaker admits that he is “not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be” and says he “should have been a pair of ragged claws / Scuttling across the floors of silent seas”. Opening with the line “Let us go then, you and I,” it describes the speaker's distaste for women who “come and go / Talking of Michelangelo.” For 10 points, identify this poem by T.S. Eliot.

answer: {Wounded Knee Massacre} (or {Battle} of {Wounded Knee})

According to some accounts, one incident which helped spark this event involved a deaf man who did not comprehend the orders to give up his gun. A court of inquiry investigated this event and exonerated Colonel James Forsyth of wrongdoing, much to the dismay of his superior General Nelson Miles. This event took place shortly after the surrender of Chief Big Foot. One precipitating cause was the teachings of Wovoka, whose preaching that the buffalo would return through Ghost Dancing alarmed the military.

answer: {Jacques Derrida}

This thinker argued that one should engage with unstable structures through flexible play in an essay about the “rupture” of the center in Western thought. The first section of one work by this thinker asserts that Western thought privileges phonetic languages and speech over writing.

This band notes that “free rides just don't come along every day” in a song that was heavily inspired by the Beatles' “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da." The subject of another song by this band “talks about closure and that validation bit," to which their singer retorts “just do me a favor and check your baggage at the door." Another song by these artists of “Why Don't You Get a Job” and “She's Got Issues” contains the lines “Hey, they don't pay no mind / If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time” after the singer says “you gotta keep ‘em separated.” For 10 points, name this Dexter Holland-fronted band whose 1994 album Smash contains “Come Out and Play” and “Self Esteem."

answer: {groups}

The Yoneda lemma in category theory generalizes a statement about these objects that suggests that every one of these objects X is isomorphic to a subset of the symmetry one of these on X, a theorem named for Cayley. Point ones are used to classify inorganic compounds for MO analysis. These objects are called normal if they are self-conjugate. Those that look locally like a manifold, such as the general linear one, are named for Sophus Lie. The center of one of these objects is a subset of it where commutativity holds, so the center of one of these is Abelian. For 10 points, name these algebraic structures with an invertible, associative binary operation.

answer: The {Confessions} of Saint Augustine [or {Confessiones}]

One section of this work asserts that God experiences all moments in one and that time is a “distention” of the soul. Its thirteen book argues that truth is an assembly of fragments of eternal memories of God.

answer: {rubisco} [or {ribulose}-{1,5}-{bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase}]

This enzyme's activase has two isoforms, the larger of which permits regulation by light or by ADP to ATP ratio, as found for one organism via its incubation with thioredoxin-f. Its inactive form can be carbamylated on a lysine residue, then inhibited. This enzyme produces phosphoglycolate, beginning an undesirable sequence of reactions that is hedged against by CAM and that is called photorespiration, owing to the similarity in bond length between diatomic oxygen and its normal substrate, which is transformed into an unstable six-carbon intermediate that splits to give two molecules of PGA. For 10 points, name this enzyme, which catalyzes the first step of the Calvin cycle.

A zinc-copper couple is used with diiodomethane and an alkene to effect this kind of transformation, and techniques for doing this three different ways with sulfur ylides are named for Corey and Chaykovsky. A reaction that does this given a divinyl ketone and a Lewis acid is named for Nazarov. A “butterfly mechanism” describes a reaction using a peroxyacid that does this. Baldwin's rules govern this process, which is carried out by the Simmons-Smith and Prilazhaev reactions. It is necessary to do this to synthesize functional groups like lactams and pyrroles.

answer: Peter Joseph William {Debye}

In an alternating electric field, this man names the equation that gives permittivity as the high frequency limit permittivity plus the difference between the low and high limit all over one plus i times frequency times relaxation time. He described the attenuation of scattering due to thermal motion as the exponential of minus a term proportional to the average of the squared scattering vector with Waller. He developed a model with a temperature-cubed dependence that incorporated phonon energy contributions, thereby improving on Einstein's, for predicting the specific heat of solids. For 10 points, name this physicist who names the length scale of a plasma.
