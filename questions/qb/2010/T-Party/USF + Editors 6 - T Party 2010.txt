This figure, depicted in the Ramsund Carving, acquired his horse at the river Busiltjorn. Heimar hid this man's daughter in a harp; that daughter, Aslaug, later married Ragnar Lodbrok. He kills and is killed by a son of Gjuki named Guttorm. Tasting the blood of one of his enemies allowed him to understand the language of birds, one of whom informed him that his foster father Regin would betray him. This owner of Grani took the form of Gunnar to leap through a ring of fire and win Brynhild, though he himself married Gudrun. His father gave him the sword Gram, which he used to kill Fafnir. For 10 points, identify this hero of the Volsung Saga, the son of Sigmund.

W.B. Yeats's “The Nineteenth Century and After” was a direct response to this poem. In its final stanza, its speaker imagines the world as “a land of dreams, / So various, so beautiful, so new”, while its opening stanza describes how certain events “Begin, and cease, and then again begin / With tremulous cadence slow”. Its speaker notes that he now hears only the “melancholy, long, withdrawing roar” of the former “Sea of Faith”, and remembers how “Sophocles long ago” heard that same sound “on the Aegean”. Opening “The sea is calm to-night”, for 10 points, identify this poem in which “ignorant armies clash by night” on a “darkling plain”, a work of Matthew Arnold.

answer: {weak} nuclear force [or {weak} interaction]

Harnik et al. argue against the anthropic principle by proposing a universe that lacks this. One instance of this interaction is modeled with a unitary matrix that includes three mixing angles and a complex phase that models CP violation. A vector minus axial Lagrangian for this force leads to maximal parity violation, making this force only affect left-handed particles. This force is responsible for quark flavor changing, was unified with electromagnetism by Glashow, Weinberg, and Salaam, and is transmitted by the massive W and Z bosons. For 10 points, name this fundamental force involved in radioactive decays.

answer: {Virgin} of the {Rocks} [accept {Madonna} of the {Rocks}]

One version of this painting may feature work by its artist's pupils such as Marco d'Oggiono and Giovan Antonio Boltraffio and was painted after the original was probably given to Louis XII. It was accompanied by side panels of angel-musicians by the de Predis brothers, part of the commission for the chapel of the Immaculate Conception in Milan's San Francesco Grande. Uriel does not point at John the Baptist in the London version, which also lacks John's cruciform stick, haloes, and its artist's characteristic sfumato. Both versions show Mary holding her hand over Jesus' head in a grotto. For 10 points, name these paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, named for their geologic features.

answer: {thyroid} gland

In one condition in this gland, antibodies attack a peroxidase or a large dimeric protein here, and that condition can occur alongside an inflammation of orbital fat and extraocular muscles more commonly associated with another disease here. The latter condition is treated by carbimazole and results in “orange-peel” skin and increased sympathetic nervous system function. Its parafollicular cells secrete a hormone that inhibits osteoclast activity and the absorption of calcium. This gland's major hormone is activated by deiodinases; relatedly, this gland is enlarged due to iodine-deficient diets in a condition called goiter. For 10 points, name this gland that secretes thyroxine.

answer: {chirality} [or {lacking inversion symmetry}; accept equivalents]

This property is possessed by reagents like the Crimmins thiazolidinethione and the Evans oxazolidinone, both auxiliaries in the aldol reaction. Transitions within a p or d set are allowed according to the Laporte selection rule if molecules have this property, the axial form of which is possessed by many binapthyl derivatives. Tartaric acid is used to separate some pairs of molecules with this property, and such molecules rotate plane-polarized light. Despite their local possession of this property, meso compounds lack it overall, much like racemates. For 10 points, name this property of pure enantiomers, which denotes that they cannot be superimposed on their mirror images.

A shipwreck off the shore of the Hejaz and a carpenter named Pacomius facilitated the reconstruction of a building for which this figure arbitrated the laying of the cornerstone.

A Grothendieck topology defines a sieve as a collection of subsets of a set with this property that themselves have this property. The Lindehöf condition for a space requires every cover of this type to have a countable subcover. Generally, two points are “separated” if each point is contained in a set of this type that doesn't contain the other. In the particular point topology, all sets that contain an arbitrary point are of this type. A subset U of a metric space has this property if every point therein has a neighborhood inside U. Sets have this property in R^n when every point is an interior point. For 10 points, name this topological property, possessed by a set if its complement is closed.
