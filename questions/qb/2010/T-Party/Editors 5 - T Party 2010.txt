answer: {IR} spectroscopy

One form of this technique used for monolayers adhered to metal substrates is called polarization-modulation-this, and another minimizes sample preparation and is called DRIFTS. Modes only give peaks in this technique if they change a molecule's dipole moment, and samples for this technique may be ground into a mull with nujol or placed between potassium bromide salt plates. Two normal modes of acid anhydrides appear around eighteen hundred wavenumbers in this technique, which features a muddled “fingerprint region.” For 10 points, name this form of spectroscopy that relies on a wavelength just longer than visible light.

answer: trees

“R-” ones are used for storing spatial data based on minimum bounding rectangles. A “rotation” on these objects increases the height of one substructure while decreasing the other; that operation is useful for rebalancing and is carried out automatically by AVL ones. These objects can be traversed preorder, inorder, or postorder, and rotations can be used to implement the “splay” operation that moves an element of a namesake type of this structure to the root. Heaps are generally implemented using this data structure, and in the average case O (log n) time is needed to search a binary one. For 10 points, name this data structure, whose terminal nodes are called leaves.
