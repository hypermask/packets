answer: {partition function}

The expected value of a system's energy is minus the beta derivative of the log of this quantity. The Helmholtz free energy is minus Boltzmann's constant times temperature times the log of this quantity, and its log is not analytic near phase transitions. A quantum form of this quantity, which normalizes probabilities over state space, is equal to the exponential of minus beta times the Hamiltonian. The canonical one is equal to e to the minus energy over the sum of Boltzmann factors over all microstates, and describes the properties of a system that can exchange only heat with its environment. For 10 points, name this quantity, often symbolized Z.

One scientist applied Kuhn's excluded volume to these compounds and developed the idea of the “theta solvent,” for which it is minimized. A coordinate convention used for this type of compound is named for that man, Paul Flory. “Living” reactions to make these are often controlled by redox equilibria.
