answer: velocity

The pressure gradient is defined as viscosity times the Laplacian of this quantity in creeping flow. In classical gases, the most probable magnitude of this quantity is equal to two-thirds of the root mean square magnitude of this quantity. The curl of this quantity for a fluid is the (*) vorticity. In classical gases, this quantity follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which assumes that each component of this vector is normally distributed. For 10 points, name this vector quantity whose addition in special relativity ensures it can never exceed that of light, the time derivative of the position vector.

answer: titration

This procedure is used with a thiosulfate solution following the addition of manganese (II), iodide, and hydroxide, then a strong acid, in the Winkler test, and this procedure forms one step of the Kjeldahl method. One form of this procedure applied to metal ions forms chelating complexes by employing EDTA. This procedure was developed, along with the law of definite proportions, by Jeremias Richter. The endpoint of this procedure is revealed by the inflection points of a graph of its progress; substances like sulfuric acid have two such inflection points. For 10 points, name this laboratory method for determining the concentration of an unknown solution of acid or base by adding a base or acid of known concentration and recording the volume necessary for neutralization.

In more primitive organisms, thick borders line scalariform perforation plates in this material. Bordering of this tissue determines amphiphloicity or ectophloicity, and it contains long cells called libriform fibers and specialized cells called tracheids. Guttation occurs when (*) root pressure forces material from this tissue out of hydathodes, and the walls of this tissue are highly lignified. This tissue is produced by the vascular cambium and functions by exerting transpirational pull. For 10 points, name this tissue that primarily transports water, which comprises the plant vascular system along with phloem.

One chapter of this work uses the example of the island Ploska, on which a wizard is able to make rain by dipping the leaves of a certain tree in water, to explain the role of the “public magician.” Another example in this book is the Rex Nemorensis, a ritual in which the king's successor ritually slays him upon ascension. That example is connected to a more (*) general concept of a dying and returning king, labeled the “King of the Wood” ceremony, which this work claims is present in both Pagan mythology and early Christian traditions.

The alignment of the quadrupole and octopole modes of one measurement of this phenomenon with the ecliptic plane is amusingly referred to as the “axis of evil.” Recent studies of this phenomenon include MAXIMA, which split off from the similar BOOMERANG experiment. The FIRAS experiment studied its anisotropies using the COBE satellites, while (*) WMAP measures its temperature. First predicted by George Gamow, it was discovered accidentally by Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias in 1964. Corresponding to a nearly perfect blackbody, for 10 points, identify this radiation left over from the Big Bang with a temperature of about two point seven Kelvin.
