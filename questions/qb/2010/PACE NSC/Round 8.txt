answer: {Egypt} [or {Misr}]

Anti-colonial sentiment in this country was fueled by the 1906 Denshawai Incident. Wilfrid Blunt wrote a “secret history” of the occupation of this country, which was achieved when a victory at Tel el-Kabir easily quashed the Urabi Revolt. This country was subsequently administered by Lord Cromer, who technically only advised Tawfiq and Abbas Hilmi. Those (*) khedives were the descendants of an ethnically Albanian governor who made cotton this country's staple crop and created the army that won the Battle of Konya. That man, Muhammad Ali, also killed the last of this country's Mamluks, who had been defeated when Napoleon invaded. For 10 points, name this African country whose cities include Alexandria and Cairo.

answer: {strong} nuclear force [or {strong} interaction; prompt on nuclear {force}; prompt on {Quantum Chromodynamics} before mention; prompt on {color force} before mention]

The theory of this interaction has a property that may be explained by a fluid composed of instantons. One phase of matter predicted by a model of this force cannot be studied by perturbation theory, necessitating the use of lattice gauge theory. One form of this interaction is mediated by virtual pi and rho mesons and is modeled by the (*) Yukawa potential. The gauge theory describing this force is based on the group SU(3) and is known as QCD. This force acts on particles with color charge and is mediated by gluons. For 10 points, identify this force whose name suggests its ability to function over much vaster distances than the weak force.

answer: monopoly

Ramsey-Boiteux pricing concerns the social welfare-maximizing pricing scheme in this market condition, for which the value of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is maximized. Joan Robinson coined the term for a symmetrical version of this situation, whose occurrence requires a lack of substitutes and absence of (*) price discrimination. Price exceeds marginal revenue in this kind of system, which exhibits deadweight loss since the marginal cost to the consumer is lower than the set price. For 10 points, name this economic situation in which one seller entirely controls the market for a good or service.

The city of Abdera was founded in honor of a man who died during a plot against one figure of this name. That figure may have resulted from Atlas' incestuous relations with Asteria, but most sources refer to him as the son of Cyrene and Ares. Another man of this name, the son of Deipyle, was one of the Epigoni who fought alongside Sthenelus and Euryalus, killed Pandarus, and knocked Aeneas down in single combat. That warrior was a favorite of (*) Athena, who helped him to wound both Ares and Aphrodite. For 10 points, identify this son of Tydeus, who shares his name with a king of the Bistones who was the object of Heracles' eighth labor and the owner of some flesh-eating mares.

answer: {Huntington's} disease [or {Huntington's} chorea]

Low levels of CREB binding protein characterize this disease, whose namesake protein is thought to be related to embryo survival and anti-apoptotic function. It sees the destruction of certain GABAergic receptors and presents atypically early in its Westphal variant. Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and striata of the (*) basal ganglia are also destroyed in this disorder, whose onset and rapidity of progression are governed by the number of CAG repeats on chromosome 4. That polyQ sequence results in cognitive degeneration and loss of muscle control. For 10 points, name this autosomal dominant illness that causes jerky movements dubbed its “chorea,” known for its characteristic onset during middle age.

An absurd episode in this country's recent history saw the Civic United Front take electoral control of Lindi and Pwani provinces by pledging to protect citizens from being serially sodomized by the shapeshifting monster Popobawa, who supposedly lives on Pemba Island. That mass panic has been likened to a 1962 outbreak in its Kagera state of epidemic (*) laughter. The concept of Ujaama was espoused in a declaration named for this country's city of Arusha by President Julius Nyerere.

answer: The {Long} Parliament

Panic over the Shrule massacre distracted this entity from the arrest of a group including Arthur Haselrig and Denzil Holles, and it rather presumptively auctioned off foreign lands to would-be “Adventurers.” This entity saw William Lenthall's control usurped by John Pym and sought to ensure its authority with the Triennial Act, passed shortly before it witnessed the executions of Thomas Wentworth and William (*) Laud. The Solemn League and Covenant saw it ally with Scottish forces in the wake of the Bishops' Wars, two years after issuing the Grand Remonstrance. Henry Ireton and Thomas Pryde ejected much of this body, leaving a remnant dubbed “Rump.” For 10 points, identify this parliament whose clash with Charles I triggered the English Civil War, named for its unusual eight-year duration.

One class of these may be analyzed by a condition named for Dini. Considering one of these objects named for Dirichlet as a function of the exponent in the denominator gives the Riemann zeta function. One of these objects named for Grandi illustrates a restriction to a method of analyzing (*) “telescoping” examples of these objects, while a set that may be analyzed with Abel's criterion includes alternating ones. Geometric ones will converge for all r between minus one and one, and arithmetic ones will always diverge. For 10 points, name this type of object, whose terms are summed rather than listed.

The losing general employed a horseshoe formation and used Gaius Sosius to break the enemy lines, but had his strategy betrayed by the defector Quintus Dellius. Malaria-infected (*) vessels were set aflame and the remaining ships tied together before the losing general eventually fled this clash, whose winner stayed out of range of the enemy quinquiremes.

This quantity's variance with temperature is described by the Eotvos equation. The difference in pressure across the interface of two static fluids is twice this quantity times the mean (*) curvature according to LaPlace's law.
