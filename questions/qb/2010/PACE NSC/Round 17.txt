answer: Saint {Jerome}

Ghirlandiao's depiction of this figure faces Botticelli's St. Augustine in the Ognissanti church. A partridge and peacock occupy the top step at the entrance to a house in a depiction of this figure by Antonello da Messina, who appears emaciated in a red cloak in several works by Caravaggio. A pear-shaped gourd, likely a reference to a linguistic debate, hangs at top right in the most famous depiction of this figure, which shows a hat with ribbons and an (*) hourglass on a wall above him as he stares past a small crucifix toward a skull on a windowsill. That work also depicts a dog and a lion resting in the foreground and is often grouped with its artist's Melancolia I and Knight, Death, and the Devil. For 10 points, name this saint depicted by Durer “in his study” as he translates the Vulgate.

One early Supreme Court case on this topic saw Secretary of Commerce Philip Klutznick sued over a program for “MBEs” by ventilation company owner Earl Fullilove; that case was reversed by Richmond v. Croson. Strict scrutiny was applied to this concept in Adarand Constructors v. Pena, which featured a notable concurrence condemning all forms of this practice by (*) Clarence Thomas. Cases that accepted “individualized inquiry” but struck down the use of a “points system” in this practice were brought by Grutter and Gratz against Lee Bollinger, then president of the University of Michigan. For 10 points, name this policy whose use at UC-Davis was the subject of the 1978 Bakke case and which attempts to increase the number of minorities and women in education and employment.

answer: Orestes

In a dream, this character identifies himself with a snake that bloodily nurses at his mother's breast. One work sees this man plot to kill Hermione and Helen, while in another appearance, this figure proves his identity by describing an ancient spear owned by Pelops before fleeing Thoas with an idol of Artemis. Fabricated news of this character's death leaves his childhood nurse Cilissa heartbroken. Apollo (*) defends this man for an act committed with Pylades, which leads to one titular group being renamed “the kindly ones” for sparing this figure for the murder of Aegisthus at the close of The Libation Bearers. The Furies plague, for 10 points, what killer of Clytemnestra, the son of Agammenon, brother of Elektra, and namesake of a trilogy by Aeschylus?

answer: {red giant} [prompt on giant]

Stars in this stage display S-process elements in their spectra and diverge into a “horizontal branch” and a “clump.” The beginning of this phase marks a star's first dredge-up, at which point it will begin to ascend the asymptotic branch of the HR diagram named for these stars. Especially low-mass stars (*) cannot enter this phase because they are fully convective; stars in this stage either fuse hydrogen into helium in their shells, over a large inert helium core, or, later, form carbon via the triple-alpha process. Larger, “super” variants of these stars include Betelgeuse, and examples of these stars include Aldebaran. Earth's sun will one day become, for 10 points, what kind of large star characterized by a certain high-wavelength color?

answer: Saint {Augustine} of Hippo [or Aurelius {Augustinus} Hipponensis]

This man asserted that the only object men should enjoy is the Trinity in a work that examines the different types of ambiguous signs that can prevent the full understanding of Scripture. Another work by this man claims that good angels wish that sacrificial power be directed to God alone in a work that contests the scapegoating of a certain group for a certain military action. This figure describes a pivotal experience stealing from a (*) pear orchard in a work heavily influenced by Ambrose of Milan; that work sees this man relate how a child's voice instructed him to read the Bible and reject Manichaeism in favor of the Christianity of his mother Monica.

answer: molecular {diffusion} [prompt on {osmosis} before mention]

A model of this process in multicomponent systems that permits its namesake coefficients to be negative was developed independently by Maxwell and Stefan. An ensemble of photons can be modeled with equations for this process in materials with high optical depth and low mean free path. Two laws of this process give the time derivative of the field as k times the second position derivative of the field and give the flux J as negative k times the first position derivative; those are (*) Fick's laws. For 10 points, identify this process referred to as “osmosis” when the substance in question is water, in which molecules move down a gradient from regions of high concentrations to regions of lower concentrations.
