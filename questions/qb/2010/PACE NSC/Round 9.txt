One property of a structure formed by two of these materials may be calculated as the difference in the electron affinities by Anderson's rule; those structures were suggested for use in lasers by Herbert Kroemer. These materials are maximally efficient light emitters if the top and bottom of two structures describing these materials occur for the same value of the Fermi wave vector. Amorphous examples of this type of material form interfaces with (*) insulators and feature localized and extended states separated by a “mobility edge.” They may be classified as N or P type based on their mobile charge character. These materials are also characterized by the size of the energy difference between their valence and conduction bands. For 10 points, name these materials that have resistance between that of resistors and conductors.
