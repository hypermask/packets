The secession of William Yancey's fire-eaters repeatedly derailed one of these events. Jerry Rubin proclaimed the addition of the porcine “Pigasus the Immortal” to one of these events, whose wake prompted the McGovern-Fraser Commission to address their flawed procedures. One of these events was fractured after a speech lauding “human rights” and extolling the listeners to “get out of the shadow of (*) states' rights,” triggering a break led by Strom Thurmond. Adlai Stevenson prevailed at one of these events without ever running, while the Cross of Gold speech was delivered by William Jennings Bryan at one in 1896.

answer: rheumatoid {arthritis}

Tests to diagnose this disease include the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide test and the anti-mutated vimentin assay. DMARDs are a class of drugs used primarily to treat this disease, also treated by the TNF inhibitor infliximab. This disease's namesake factor is an IgM antibody against the constant region of human IgG, which is also present in Sjogren's syndrome and (*) lupus. High cytokine activity contributes to the progression of this disease, which can induce the swan's neck and Z-thumb deformities. Caused by autoimmune destruction of collagen II-containing membranes, it results in disruption of the synovium of small joints and associated swelling.

This man included “The Genteel Tradition in American Philosophy” in his critique of contemporaries like Bergson, Winds of Doctrine. One book by this thinker rejects Kant's theory of disinterestedness and posits that the title concept arises from personal connection rather than art. He argued that ideals originate from the four forms of experienced reality in a collection examining the titular concept “in religion” and “in common sense.” Another work by this author of (*) The Sense of Beauty claims that philosophy must begin “in media res” and asserts that idealism is irrelevant since the world is understood through the pragmatic belief in our senses embodied by the first titular concept.

This city's early history was dominated by the worship of the patron deities Hubal and Manat, and an important incident saw some of its citizens flee to Negus of Axum. The Qarmatians notoriously sacked this city, whose rule participated in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence. As its citizens prepared to execute a negotiator, the Pledge of the Tree was taken outside of its walls, leading it to promptly accept the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah.

Clifford Geertz likened this work to a satire by Jonathan Swift, and it has been criticized for the unusual experiences of a case study named Robert. This work describes it subjects as “debtor[s] to the ages” and includes a section on the regularity of gardens.

answer: The {Exorcist}

This film's protagonist is haunted over abandoning his terminally ill mother, and an early scene sees an astronaut menaced at a party with line “you're going to die up there.” Lee J. Cobb's character of Will Kinderman inspired an abysmal second sequel to this film, whose antagonist is often called Captain Howdy. Key effects in this film were achieved by building the main set inside a (*) freezer and employing a few cans of pea soup. Its antagonist, Pazuzu, faces off against a younger version of the title character, played by Stellan Skarsgard, in the 2005 prequel Dominion.

answer: {cosmological constant} [accept {lambda} before mention]

The sign of this parameter differentiates between de Sitter and anti de Sitter space. It is multiplied by c squared and divided by 3 in one term of the Friedmann equation. Quantum field theory predicts it to be on the order of the Planck mass to the fourth and it is measured to be drastically smaller. This quantity minus half the scalar curvature multiplied by the metric tensor is proportional to the stress-energy tensor in the (*) Einstein field equations. This quantity found renewed relevance when observations of type Ia (“one A”) supernovae revealed that the universe's expansion was accelerating. For 10 points, name this parameter introduced by Albert Einstein to ensure that general relativity would still predict a static universe, often symbolized lambda.

Malus' law gives the transmitted intensity of polarized light as the square of this function of the polarizer's angle relative to the incoming light. In Compton scattering, the wavelength shift is proportional to 1 minus this function of the scattering angle. The intensity observed from a Lambertian surface is proportional to this function of the angle between the observer and the surface normal. This function's hyperbolic version describes the shape of a freely hanging chain supported at both ends and subject to a uniform gravitational force. The dot product of two vectors is given by the product of their magnitudes times this function of the angle between them. For 10 points, identify this trigonometric function whose square plus the square of the sine is always 1.
