answer: the {border} between {Germany} and {Poland} [accept obvious equivalents]

One attempt to define this entity was the Treaty of Zgorzelec, and discussion of it at the Potsdam Conference led Churchill to denounce the “enormous and wrongful” demands to move it during the Iron Curtain speech. In 2007, police departments protested against the opening of this construct, which currently runs from Zittau to Szczecin. After World War II, up to seven million people were forcibly moved to be on the proper side of this redefined (*) line, in one of the largest population exchange in history. Once overrun during the Fall Weiss plan, its current form is based on the Oder-Neisse Line proposed by Stalin, who moved it further west to punish the country which violated this boundary in a quest for lebensraum. For 10 points, identify this map line which was crossed on September 1, 1939 by Nazi forces, thus triggering World War II.

These objects are home to Colossus Wasps, which prey on another species that inhabits them, the exogorths. A particular one was the location for the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force outpost near Crustai, and another was where Maw Installation was situated. Shortly before stating a disdain for excuses, one character announces that these objects “do not concern me” to Admiral Piett. A sonic charge is used in a dogfight among these objects near (*) Geonosis, and another group of these is encountered as a result of an clash with Death Squadron; the chance of surviving that incident is given as 3,720 to 1. During an attempt to seek refuge within one of these objects, the presence of mynocks reveals that a space slug is impersonating a cave. For 10 points, name these objects which made up a field near the Hoth system that the Millennium Falcon flew into in The Empire Strikes Back

One of this man's sons shares his name with a Zeus-fathered king of Samothrace; that son, Emathion, ruled in Arabia until being killed by Heracles. Another son of this man led an army that turned into birds upon his death and engendered Achilles's rage by slaying Nestor's son Antilochus. This figure was bribed with a golden vine by his half-brother Priam in order to send that son, (*) Memnon of Ethiopia, to fight in the Trojan War. This son of Laomedon became the consort of the mother of the winds, who eventually sealed him in a room after realizing the implications of praying to Zeus for his immortality, but not his eternal youth. For 10 points, identify this consort of Eos who eventually became a cicada.

answer: {Louis XVIII} [or {Louis} Stanislas {Xavier} de France; prompt on {Louis}]

While suffering from gout in exile at Hartwell House, this ruler issued a declaration offering to compensate sufferers of violence during the regimes of his predecessor. This ruler presided over the Unobtainable Chamber, consisting of several ultra-royalists who received votes in the wake of the murders of Marshal Brune and Jean-Pierre Ramel in the Second White Terror. This ruler created the Chamber of Deputies and Chamber of Peers to represent the people and wished to oust Joachim Murat from Naples. The momentum this ruler built up from his Charter of (*) 1814 was derailed in the wake of the Hundred Days, which saw the return of Napoleon.

answer: {isostasy} [prompt on {post}-{glacial rebound}]

This idea underlies the mechanics of competing theories due to Bullard and Vening Meinesz, which explained data that remained anomalous even after applying the Bouguer correction. This concept explains why the Gulf of Bothnia will eventually close. One model for this concept holds that rocks with less density will be topographically higher. Another model for this concept claims that crust thickness will cause altitude changes. The aforementioned models are the Airy and Pratt models for this concept, which is analogous to buoyancy. Post-glacial rebound is one consequence of this concept. For 10 points, name this term for the gravitational equilibrium between the asthenosphere and lithosphere, which describes how tectonic plates “float.”

Like Wilfrid Sellars, this man founded a journal called Philosophical Studies. His students included the pioneers of industrial-organizational psychology, Walter Dill Scott and Hugo Münsterberg, as well as Oswald Kulpe, whose analysis of "thought processes" expanded upon this man's pioneering investigation into feelings. Despite being derided as "a rather ordinary man" by William James and as "sloppy" by his mentor Hermann Helmholtz, he extended his study to a "natural history of man" in Folk Psychology and inspired Edward Titchener to bring his methods to the U.S. For 10 points, name this author of Principles of Physiological Psychology, whose Leipzig laboratory was the first institution for experimental psychology.

answer: {Creek} War [prompt on “{Red Sticks War}” before mentioned]

One group involved in this war was divided into factions which supported or opposed the modernization efforts of Benjamin Hawkins. Its climax occurred when the home village of William Weatherford, or Red Eagle, was burned. The destruction of Tallasahatchee and Talladega also occurred during this war, which began with an attack on Lake Tensaw. That attack saw the Fort Mims massacre perpetrated by the (*) Red Sticks, who had been stirred up by the warnings of the itinerant Tecumseh. More than half of present-day Alabama was ceded in the Treaty of Fort Jackson that ended this war. That treaty followed the decisive Battle of Horseshoe Bend and was negotiated by Andrew Jackson. For 10 points, identify this 1813 to 1814 conflict between American settlers and a namesake group of Indians.

answer: {Fine Structure} constant

In the Klein-Nishina formula, the square of this value is multiplied by one half the square of the Compton radius and a polynomial involving Cos theta and ratios of photon energies. The Rydberg constant is equal to the square of this value multiplied by the mass of the electron times c, all divided by four pi h-bar, and the Lamb shift is proportional to the fifth power of this quantity. One method of calculating this quantity involves setting the Lande (*) g-factor equal to a polynomial in this value, while applying perturbation theory to QED results in power series in terms of this quantity, which was originally posited as the ratio of the velocity of an electron in the Bohr model to the speed of light. At high energies this value would diverge at the Landau pole. Also defined as e squared over h bar c, for 10 points, name this coupling constant for the electromagnetic force, which Arthur Eddington posited to be equal to exactly one over 137.

A prominent phrase associated with this figure was adopted from a favorite taunt of the mythical Puck, while he is syncretized with John the Baptist and Uncle Sam into the deity John Frum. Joseph Stalin mandated blue iconography for Ded Moroz to avoid conflation with this figure, who is aided in some traditions by a young man in blackface named Peter. This figure is linked with a man venerated for providing a dowry for three poor girls as Bishop of (*) Myra. In Germanic tradition, he is joined by a horrifying demon who roams the streets and assaults women, Krampus. This figure's supposed activities coincide with a traditional Catholic midnight mass at the culmination of Advent. Comet and Dancer aid, for 10 points, what North Pole resident who serially trespasses through chimneys on Christmas?
