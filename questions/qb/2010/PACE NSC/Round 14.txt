answer: bacteriophage

A repressor found in one example of these entities binds to OR1, OR2, and OR3 and is a dimer named c1; that example expresses genes gam, red, xis, and int when its genome is transcribed leftward. One of these entities concatenates several copies of its genome, then cuts that structure into segments of the original length, forming circular permutations of the original sequence. That example cannot (*) integrate its genome into the host and instead must employ ribosomes until the host organism bursts. The T4 variety of this kind of virus employs the lytic cycle in infecting E. coli, as does the “lambda” variant. For 10 points, name this group of viruses that infect bacteria.

Benchmarks for these operations include the Calgary and Cambridge corpuses, tests in which the PAQ algorithm performs efficiently but slowly. Fractals are used in one method of doing this with images, while a more notable method improves on an algorithm developed by Shannon and Fano. A dictionary is created to perform this action in a method named for Lempel, Ziv and Welch, which contrasts with the prefix code used in (*) Huffman coding. A destructive form of it is used in the MPEG format; that is the “lossy” version of this process. For 10 points, identify this process of shrinking data, exemplified by RAR and ZIP formats.

One tributary of this river, the Skardu, is depleted because of the melting of the Baltoro Glacier in Baltistan. In May 2010, a city at the confluence of two other tributaries, the Hunza and the Gilgit, had to be evacuated because of a water surge. A 1960 treaty governing water use on this river was necessary because it flows through Ladakh before entering the country with which it is (*) most associated, but some criticize that treaty for increasing desertification in the Thar Desert. The Kabul River flows into this river, which flows through the Sindh and Punjab Provinces before emptying into the Arabian Sea.

answer: electric charge

One equation that gives this quantity sets it equal to isospin plus half the sum of baryon number and strangeness and was developed by Gell-Mann and Nishijima. The quantization of this quantity was demonstrated in an experiment in which the force of gravity was made to balance the buoyant and electric forces experienced by a set of (*) oil droplets, which was carried out by Robert Millikan; that quantum is equal to one over Avogadro's number times the Faraday constant. The electric flux through a surface is set equal to this quantity enclosed by that surface in Gauss's law. When two bound particles have opposite signs for this property, an electric dipole is created. For 10 points, name this property measured in coulombs.

One work by this man links the “guilty conscience” to the quashing of natural instincts in order to live peacefully with a father-figure, while another posits the projection of negative aspects of ambivalence onto sacred objects. This man described the development of a metaphorical cyborg-like human in a work suggesting that the oceanic feeling could amend his earlier The (*) Future of an Illusion and modify his conjecture of eros and thanatos as driving forces. "Irma's Injection" is used as an example in another work by this author of Totem and Taboo and Civilization and its Discontents, who claimed that the title entities were wish fulfilments in a work introducing the Oedipus complex.
