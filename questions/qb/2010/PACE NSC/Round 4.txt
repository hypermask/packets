answer: {colloids}

Regional shifts in concentration in these substances occur in a process called creaming, and the formation of stable aqueous ones is called peptization. The drop in electric potential between the slipping plane and a point in the bulk of these substances is called the zeta potential. These entities destabilize in a clumping process called (*) flocculation, and the scattering particularly of blue wavelengths within them is known as the Tyndall effect. Unlike suspensions, the particles in these substances do not spontaneously settle over time. For 10 points, name these substances that include sols and emulsions, examples of which include paint, milk, and smoke.

One variety of this effect produces Kossel lines, and Kikuchi lines are a result of this effect in transmission electron microscopes. Theories of this phenomenon include Rayleigh-Sommerfield, and one device which makes use of it consists of concentric alternating black and white rings. One equation describing it equates order times wavelength with twice the distance between crystal planes times the (*) angle, a law named for Bragg, and when this phenomenon occurs through a circular aperture it produces elliptical zones named for Fresnel. When this effect occurs in the far-field limit, it is named for Fraunhofer. For 10 points, name this phenomenon, the bending of light around obstacles.

answer: circle

This curve can be considered the limit of an apeirogon in Euclidian geometry. A Reuleaux triangle is formed by the mutual intersection of three of these objects, and Apollonius's problem concerns their mutual tangency. In hyperbolic geometry, its length is equal to two pi times sinh [“cinch”] r. The Cesaro equation for this curve is k equals one over a, meaning it is the only curve with constant finite (*) curvature at all points. It is the conic section with zero eccentricity formed by a plane perpendicular to the cone's axis of symmetry. Its equation can be given parametrically by x equals A cosine t and y equals A sine t. For 10 points, name this figure which is the locus of all points the same distance from the center, whose “unit” variety has radius 1.
