A key paper on one form of it, “Lost in the Shopping Mall,” was written by Elizabeth Loftus, who has served as an expert witness concerning this phenomenon. One form of it is affected by the (*) “magic number” of seven plus or minus two, which can be expanded by “chunking.” Another form of it arises from sudden, traumatic events and is known as the vivid, “flashbulb” form of this phenomenon.

answer: {temperature} [prompt on {T}]

In statistical mechanics, this quantity is the conjugate variable to entropy, and for a system at constant volume, it is defined as the derivative of internal energy with respect to entropy. The Van't Hoff equation evaluates the changes in the dissociation constant associated with changes in this quantity, which decreases in throttling processes in real gases due to the (*) Joule-Kelvin effect and which is held constant in Boyle's law. The third law of thermodynamics states that entropy approaches a minimum as this quantity approaches absolute zero. For 10 points, identify this quantity which remains constant in isothermal processes and can be measured in Kelvins or degrees Fahrenheit.
