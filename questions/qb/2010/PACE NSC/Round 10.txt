answer: {drag} force [prompt on {air resistance} or near-equivalents]

The coefficient associated with this quantity is equal to 24 over the Reynolds number at small values of the Reynolds number; for Reynolds numbers above 1, Goldstein's approximation is often used to approximate this quantity's value. For a sphere, this quantity is equal to six pi times the viscosity times the radius times the velocity, by (*) Stokes's Law. In aerodynamics, this quantity opposes thrust. When this quantity equals the gravitational force, an object has reached terminal velocity. For 10 points, name this force that retards an object's motion through a fluid and is overcome by vehicles through thrust or lift.

answer: {traveling salesman} problem [or {TSP}]

MacGregor and Ormerod demonstrated that nonboundary points were the most important metric in having humans solve this problem, while one of the best implementations of a solution to its symmetric version is named Concorde. In APX, Christofide's algorithm can approximate versions of this problem that satisfy the triangle (*) inequality, and most solutions to this problem have made use of cutting planes. One non-optimal solution to this problem repeatedly checks for the lightest edge to a non-visited node and is called the nearest neighbor algorithm.

answer: {p} orbital

The inert pair effect is caused by the relative weakness of electrons in orbitals denoted by this letter. Electrons in orbitals denoted by this letter have an angular quantum number of one, and aromatic compounds are required to have an (*) unhybridized one of these orbitals. Overlap of these orbitals can produce either sigma or pi bonds, and three of these orbitals hybridize with one s orbital in the carbon atom in methane. Boron is the first element to require an electron in one of these orbitals. For 10 points, name this orbital that is oriented along either the x, y, or z axis and whose subshell therefore carries six electrons.

answer: mitochondria

This organelle is the site of d-aminolevulinic acid creation during porphyrin synthesis, and twenty percent of the lipids present here are cardiolipin. This organelle obtains reducing equivalents via the malate-aspartate shuttle to carry out one of its most important processes, and the TOM and TIM complexes are found in its inner membrane. Mitchell showed that one important function of this organelle occurs through a (*) chemiosmotic mechanism. Surrounded by a double membrane, its central matrix is the site where acetyl-CoA is produced before the other steps of oxidative phosphorylation, including the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. For 10 points, name this organelle, the primary site of ATP production.

The Duggan-Schwarz theorem applies this concept's mechanism to yield a set of results rather than a single one, and Holmstrom's theorem adapts it for competitive firms. Further generalized as the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, this idea was updated in 1963 with the addition of Pareto efficiency to its criteria; those criteria also include the independence of (*) irrelevant alternatives and consideration of universality.
