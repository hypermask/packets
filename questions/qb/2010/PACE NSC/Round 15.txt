answer: Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game [accept any answers involving both the name Chamberlain and the number 100; prompt on partial answer]

Dave Zinkoff provided the major record of this event, which was facilitated by Al Attles and Guy Rodgers. This event's absurd conclusion saw 80% of the participants removed after they essentially began assaulting each other. Phil Jordon's influenza bout led to Darrall Imhoff's central role in this event, whose participants were reportedly stifled by the pervasive smell of chocolate from nearby (*) Hersheypark. Nearly derailed by an all-night outing with one of the 20,000 women its instigator claimed to have slept with, it was only somewhat approached by a 2006 effort by Kobe Bryant. Inflicted upon the New York Knicks, for 10 points, name this 1962 event in which a Philadelphia Warriors center scored in the triple digits.

Protein engineering uses phi value analysis to study the structure of these entities, which are thought always to be aromatic for pericyclic reactions. These entities are predicted to be “early” or “late” by the Hammond postulate, based on whether (*) reactants or products are higher in enthalpy. These entities are located at first-order saddle points on the potential energy surface, as they are depicted as local maxima on reaction coordinate diagrams. The energy of these entities is lowered by the use of catalysts, as these entities are accessible once the activation energy is added to the reactants. For 10 points, name this entity in which all bonds are activated.

For a Wilson prime p, this function on p minus one is congruent to negative one modulo p. This function of z is given by the integral from zero to infinity dt of t to the z times e to the negative t. For large values of n, this operator on n can be approximated by Stirling's formula, and e can be written as the (*) infinite sum of the reciprocals of this function on whole numbers. It is extended to all complex numbers except the negative integers by the gamma function. This function on n represents the number of permutations of n items.

answer: {neutrino} [do not accept “{neutron}”]

The number of possible classes of this particle is determined by observing Z boson decay. A model of these particles predicts two sets of masses, one on the GUT scale, via a seesaw mechanism; that model suggests that a type of these particles exists that only interacts via gravity, the “sterile” type. Data collected from these particles (*) emitted by the sun showed that their mass and flavor eigenstates are slightly different, leading to namesake “oscillations.” A primary component of hot dark matter, one of these particles is produced along with a beta particle in beta decay. For 10 points, name this low-mass electrically neutral lepton named by Enrico Fermi to suggest a “little neutron.”
