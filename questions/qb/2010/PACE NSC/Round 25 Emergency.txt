answer: photon

The fundamental interaction mediated by this particle is described by the U(1) symmetry group. These particles form bosonic quasiparticles called polaritons when they interact with dipole excitations. Neutral pions mostly decay into two of these particles, whose scattering from electrons has a cross section given by the (*) Klein-Nishina formula. Interactions of two of these particles at high energies can create electrons and positrons through pair production, and these particles are produced in matter-antimatter annihilations. These particles are the gauge bosons of electromagnetism, have spin zero, and are massless. For 10 points, identify these particles, the quantized units of light.

This element is formed in a reaction for which a ruthenium (IV) oxide catalyst was introduced by Sumitomo, who sought to revive interest in the Deacon process, which predates electrolytic methods to form this element. This element is formed at the anode in the Castner-Kellner process and at the anode of a Downs cell. This element acts as a leaving group to allow the DNA-binding activity of both the platinum chemotherapy drug cisplatin and (*) mustard gas. This element can attack acetal resin and polybutene used in pipes, causing them to develop a brownish residue. One oxide of this element forms an anion present in bleach, and it is used as an additive to water principally in swimming pools. For 10 points, name this element, whose anion forms, with sodium, table salt.
