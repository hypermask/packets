answer: {magnetic} field [or B field before mentioned]

In a two-dimensional system, the presence of this entity leads to Landau levels in a phenomenon wherein topological quantum numbers like the Chern numbers arise in calculating the conductivity due to this entity; that phenomenon is the quantum (*) Hall effect.
