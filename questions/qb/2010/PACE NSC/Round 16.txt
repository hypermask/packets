answer: {Baghdad}

Masudi's Meadows of Gold places this city at the culmination of civilization and chronicles its growth from the palaces of al-Mansur. Ownership of opulent properties in this city by Yahya and Ja'far contributed to the downfall of the Barmakid family as viziers of this city's rulers. Thabit, the Banu Musas, and al-Khwarizmi headlined this city's (*) House of Wisdom, a massive scholarly institute funded by al-Mamun, whose father Harun al-Rashid launched this city's golden age. Al-Musta'sim's incompetent defense of this city supposedly caused that great wealth of scholarship to stain the rivers black with ink when it was sacked in 1258 by Hulagu Khan. Succeeding Damascus as the center of the Muslim world, for 10 points, name this one-time Abbasid capital, which remains the present-day capital of Iraq.

answer: {heat} capacity [or {specific heat} capacity]

The contribution to this quantity by spin waves in a ferromagnet arises from a k-squared dispersion relation. An early model of this quantity fails to predict third power low temperature dependence because it assumes every atom is an independent harmonic oscillator. One relation approximates this quantity in the high (*) temperature limit as three times Boltzmann's constant times particle number; that model, named for Debye, improved the Dulong-Petit law relating this quantity from crystal lattice vibrations. The ideal gas constant is equal to the difference between this quantity calculated at constant pressure and at constant volume. For 10 points, name this quantity, the amount of energy required to change a body's temperature by a given amount.

answer: Wallace Stevens

This author described how night came “striding like the color of the heavy hemlocks” in a poem in which he “remembered the cry of the peacocks.” He called man “the Socrates of snails” in a poem about Crispin, who plans a colony of poets after journeying to the Yucatan and Carolina. This poet of “Domination of Black” and “The Comedian as the Letter C” wrote a poem calling a woman “the single artificer of the world” because she (*) “sang beyond the genius of the sea” and wrote “Let be be finale of seem” in a poem from his Harmonium. For 10 points, name this American poet of “The Idea of Order at Key West” who wrote “Call the roller of big cigars” in his “The Emperor of Ice Cream.”

answer: {Anabaptists}

After the execution of this group's leader Michael Sattler, this group accepted the Schleitheim Confession as their official doctrine. One faction of this group legalized polygamy when John of Leyden took over Munster and introduced this group's doctrines as the town's law. This group included the Zwikau Prophets, initiated the (*) Radical Reformation, and saw a subdivision founded by Dutch ex-priest Menno Simons. This denomination, which includes Mennonites and the Amish, divides its namesake practice into “spirit” and “fire” types in addition to the usual “water” form. For 10 points, name this group that broke with the Lutherans over a certain sacrament reserved by this group for adults but administered by other Protestants and Catholics to infants.

answer: Richard Georg {Strauss} [prompt on {Strauss}]

This man claimed that he wrote one triple fugue to “bring together Mama, Papa, and Baby.” This composer of Symphonia Domestica depicted the title figure's “Adversaries,” “Battle,” and “Works of Peace” in movements of his tone poem A Hero's Life. One of this man's tone poems uses violas to represent priests and bassoons to represent professors, while a horn and clarinet represent the title (*) trickster. Another of his works features an extended violin solo in “The Dance Song” and contains “The Song of the Night-Wanderer.” For 10 points, name this composer of Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks and a work featured during a sunrise in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, the first movement of Also Sprach Zarathustra.

answer: {Sir Lancelot du Lac} [or {Launcelot}; or the {White} Knight]

This character discovered his true name under a metal slab after chasing off the Copper Knight and taking over the castle of Joyous Guard. This man, who once talked Galehaut into surrendering, defeated a pair of illusory lions by crossing the Sword Bridge to the land of Gorre after earlier gaining a nickname by jumping into a dwarf-driven cart. He defeated Claudas to recover the kingdom of his father, King (*) Ban of Medwick, and slew Meleagant in a duel. This cousin of Bors and Lionel embarks on the Grail Quest along with Perceval and his son by Elaine of Corbenic, Galahad. For 10 points, name this knight who carried on a long affair with Guinevere, the greatest Knight of the Round Table.

answer: the {Grangers} [accept {Patrons} of {Husbandry} before mention]

A law advocated by this group was upheld by a Supreme Court opinion concerning “control ... by the public for the public good.” This group's transformation into several parties was largely the work of the newspaper Anti-Monopolist, edited by Shakespeare conspiracy theorist Ignatius Donnelly. Four years after staging nationwide protests on the Fourth of July, 1873, this organization won a victory in the case (*) Munn v. Illinois, which upheld a law capping usage fees for grain elevators. Originally founded by Oliver Hudson Kelley as the Patrons of Husbandry, for 10 points, name this network of local halls devoted to improving agricultural techniques and changing laws in favor of farmers.

answer: {superconductors} [or {superconductivity}; accept word forms]

Two types of these objects were delineated by Abrikosov with respect to one model, whose namesake parameter is the ratio of the penetration depth to the coherence length. The free energy of these objects is minimized when the Laplacian of H equals the negative square of the London penetration depth times H, a condition that results in a form of perfect (*) diamagnetism unrelated to the expected Lenz's law cancellation. These materials may be modeled by Ginzberg-Landau theory or by constructing a superfluid of bosons called Cooper pairs. YBCO is a high-temperature example of these materials, which expel magnetic fields in the Meissner effect. BCS theory governs, for 10 points, what materials that exhibit zero electrical resistance?

answer: Claudio {Monteverdi}

In one work by this composer, the title character sings to his wife on his wedding day in the aria Rosa del ciel, vita del mondo e degna. Another work by this composer of The Return of Ulysses to His Country ends with the title character and her husband singing the love duet Pur ti miro, which may have been composed by Benedetto Ferrari. In that opera, (*) Nerone orders the death of Seneca and obtains a divorce from Ottavia so that he can marry the title character and have her named empress. Another of his works succeeds Jacopo Peri's treatment of the same topic, the death of Eurydice. For 10 points, name this early Italian composer of operas such as The Coronation of Poppea and L'Orfeo.

answer: Fall/Siege/Battle of {Constantinople}

Philip the Good hosted the Feast of the Pheasant as a response to this event but only succeeded in getting drunk. This action's main perpetrator supposedly drowned his horse while rushing to berate an incompetent subordinate. It followed the construction of the Rumelian forts under the convert Zaganos, who helped the victors bypass a massive chain stretched out from the (*) Galata Tower. Giovanni Giustiniani substantially delayed this action, during which Loukas Notaras never relinquished the Sea Wall despite the recent advents in cannon design that felled the Double Walls of Theodosius. The Palaeologus dynasty ended when the Golden Horn was taken in this action that saw Mehmet II triumph over Constantine XI. For 10 points, identify this 1453 siege in which the Ottomans toppled the Byzantine capital.

answer: Albert {Camus}

This author wrote of an engineer who forgoes constructing a sea-wall in Iguape to assume the title burden in “The Growing Stone” and described Patrice's killing of Roland Zagreus in A Happy Death. One of his protagonists resents being unable to attack a motorcyclist and frequents the Amsterdam bar “Mexico City.” This creator of the “judge-penitent” (*) Jean-Baptiste Clamence wrote a work in which the death of an actor during a performance of Gluck's Orpheus shocks Cottard and Tarrou, who have been working in Oran with Dr. Rieux to stop the titular outbreak. For 10 points, name this author of The Fall and The Plague who wrote of the death of an Arab at the hands of Meursault in The Stranger.
