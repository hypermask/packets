answer: electronegativity <Wynne>

This property has been found to relate linearly to isomer shifts in the Mossbauer spectra of some compounds. A formulation of it that uses Slater's rules to estimate effective nuclear charge and does not hold for d-block elements is named for Allred and Rochow. One way of calculating it involves taking the square root of the difference between the (*) dissociation energy of a bond between two different atoms and the average dissociation energy of diatomic compounds of each of those atoms. Calculated by averaging ionization energy and electron affinity, it is measured by scales named for Pauling and Mulliken. For 10 points, name this ability of an atom in a compound to attract electrons, whose highest value is seen in fluorine.
