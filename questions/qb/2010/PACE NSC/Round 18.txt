answer: Michel {Foucault} [or {Paul}-Michel {Foucault}]

One essay by this thinker claims that the title figure exists not as interpretive guide but as structural “function” within a work that indicates status. In one work, this writer of “What is an Author?” traced the historical development of the conditions under which sets of “statements” create networks of meaning. That book, The Archeology of Knowledge, built heavily on a work discussing epistime that opens with an examination of (*) Las Meninas, The Order of Things. This thinker describes the dissociation of identity and disease through the “medical gaze” in one work, while another examines the shift from public torture to “gentler” institutions like Bentham's Panopticon. For 10 points, name this French author of The Birth of the Clinic and Discipline and Punish.

answer: {alkynes}

These compounds and ketones are given in a fragmentation of alpha, beta epoxyketones. This functional group can be installed on a pseudohalide by a palladium catalyst in the Sonogashira reaction, and they are synthesized from aldehydes in the Corey-Fuchs reaction. Reacting these compounds with a lead-poisoned palladium catalyst named for (*) Lindlar reduces them to alkenes. The smallest stable cyclic example of these compounds has eight carbons, and the simplest example of these compounds is acetylene. For 10 points, name these compounds characterized by a triple bond between two carbons.

answer: Mikhail Yuryevich {Lermontov}

In one poem by this author, a man lies “in a dale of Dagestan” thinking of a beautiful girl while dying of a bullet wound. This author of “The Dream” wrote a long poem in which Tamara is the object of affection of the enemy of the Guardian Angel. Another work by this author sees the protagonist meet his old flame Vera while courting Princess Mary. That work by this author of “The (*) Demon” is narrated partly by Maxim Maximitch and culminates in a duel at the edge of a cliff between Grushnitski and Pechorin.

answer: {Jewish} Revolts or {Romano}-{Jewish Wars} [accept equivalents]

To offset the instability caused by one of these conflicts, Parthamaspatas was briefly installed on the throne of Ctesiphon and Cyrenica had to be repopulated; that second of these was named after the general Lucius Quietus. The first was supposedly triggered by insensitive bird sacrifices and saw Agrippa II flee shortly before the 12th Legion was ambushed in a mountain pass. Leaders of these events include John of Giscala and a man given the epithet (*) “Son of a Star” to fuel his messianic claims, Bar Kokhba. Josephus related the mass suicide of the Sicarii, a group of Zealots, after the siege of Masada during the first of these conflicts, which saw Titus destroy the Second Temple. For 10 points, identify these revolts against Roman rule by a certain religious group, supported by figures like Rabbi Akiva.

answer: the {Trout} Quintet [or Franz {Schubert's Piano} Quintet in A {major}, {D.} 667]

This composition's first movement recapitulation is a near-exact repeat of the exposition in the subdominant. The instrumentation of this piece may have been influenced by the composer's patron Sylvester Paumgartner, and the key of the andante second movement rises by half steps, beginning and ending in F major. Ascending sextuplets appear in all but the scherzo movement of this piece and may represent the action of (*) leaping. The instrumentation of this work substitutes a double bass for a second violin, and the fourth movement of this work is a series of variations on a lied by its composer, “Die Forelle.” For 10 points, name this work for five instruments by Franz Schubert, possibly inspired by the movements of the namesake fish.

answer: {floating} point {numbers} [or {floats}; or {floating} points]

Primitive computers often must implement the Horner algorithm to perform operations on them, and accuracy on multiple iterations of them can be improved using the Kahan summation algorithm. A bias of 127 is usually added to them, and they also contain a mantissa, sometimes called a significand. The current standard for these is IEEE [“I-Triple-E”] 754, and (*) subtraction on these is complicated by a namesake roundoff error. This data type is less precise than the “double,” and operations on them are measured in flops. For 10 points, name these representations of decimals in languages like C++, often contrasted with integers and more computationally imposing than their “fixed” counterparts.
