answer: Edmund {Burke}

This thinker wrote that the progress of history would destroy the tyranny of government in a satire that extended Lord Bolingbroke's opposition of religion to politics. Another work by this author of Vindication of Natural Society examines the four causes of the two title concepts, which are contrasted as that which pleases and that which can compel and destroy. This author of A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of The (*) Sublime and Beautiful argued that governments based on abstractions lead to tyranny and that gradual political reform is preferable to violent revolt in a work inspired by a recent event. For 10 points, name this English author whose Reflections on the Revolution in France were disputed in The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine.

In 1997, rioting broke out in this region after the execution of 30 activists in the city of Gulja, which lies on the Ili River. The northern half of this region is dominated by the Dzungarian Basin and contains Turpan, a city located on the northern part of a trade route that branched out to avoid the Taklamakan Desert. Lop Nur is a major nuclear test site in this resource-rich region. Migration to this province's city of (*) Kashgar has fueled ethnic unrest, while the summer of 2009 saw major rioting in this region's Han-dominated capital of Urumqi. For 10 points, identify this province of northwestern China, often referred to as the autonomous region of a certain predominantly Islamic ethnic group.

An influential article containing contemporary aerial photographs of this entity was published in 1979 by David Wyman. Britain failed to react to the Vrba-Wetzler Report on it, while one institution of this name provided services for the nearby IG Farben Company. Late in its operation, many occupants were perilously transferred to the Wodzislaw train station. Larger than installations at (*) Belzec and Treblinka, this location was overseen by Rudolf Franz Hoss and carried out a treacherous mass exodus to Bergen-Belsen. It prominently employed Zyklon B and was the site of research by Josef Mengele, and the phrase “arbeit macht frei” was crafted into its iron gates. For 10 points, name this largest Nazi concentration camp, located in Poland.

The quasiparticle that represents excitations in these entities are localized due to charge-transfer complexes in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Warm electrons in these substances follow a dispersion relation named for Bohm and Gross, and Bennett pinches are filamentary structures that form in them. A type of low-frequency oscillation in these substances is known as an (*) Alfven wave. The formation of these substances is described by the Saha equation, and they can be modeled with the Vlasov equation. Their characteristics may be determined by a special electrode called a Langmuir probe, and they exhibit a characteristic interaction length named for Debye. Exemplified by lightning, for 10 points, name this fourth phase of matter composed of an ionized gas.

This deity vowed to bring fifteen hundred people into the world every day after another deity vowed to kill a thousand. He once rolled a gigantic boulder into a mountain pass and turned his headdress into a bunch of grapes and his comb into bamboo shoots to delay that counterpart's actions. He also came across a peach tree whose fruit he threw to fend off eight thunder gods and a group of (*) shikome on a journey sparked by the sight of his wife's maggot-eaten body. This owner of the spear Amenonuhoko hacked up his son Kagustuchi, whose fiery birth had killed his wife. After escaping from Yomi, he performed misogi, which resulted in the birth of his children Tsukuyomi, Susano'o, and Amaterasu. For 10 points, identify this Shinto creator god, the male counterpart of Izanami.

answer: {Fourth} Amendment [prompt on descriptions thereof]

Cases involving this amendment still centrally rely on 1920's Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. U.S. The Supreme Court ruled that this amendment was not violated by a helicopter in Ciraolo, which was extended to more recent technology in Kyllo. The case Arizona v. Hicks outlined specific physical conditions for compliance with this amendment, while New Jersey v. T.L.O. concerned its application to certain (*) institutions. The exclusionary rule guards against violations of this amendment, which are generally invalidated as “fruit of the poisonous tree.” The “plain view” doctrine provides an exception to this amendment, which was extended to state governments in Mapp v. Ohio. For 10 points, name this amendment in the Bill of Rights that protects against unreasonable search or seizure.

answer: {gibberellins}

The protein DWARF1 encodes for a receptor of one of these hormones, while plants deficient in phytochrome B tend to overexpress these hormones or their receptors. These hormones act by stimulating the degradation of DELLA proteins, and proplastids produce and export the starting material for them. They are synthesized from (*) ent-kaurene in the apical meristem, and they cause sugars to be produced from starch by stimulating the production of alpha-amylase. Fungal infection resulting in an excess of this hormone causes bakanae, or foolish seedling disease. For 10 points, name these plant hormones that promote leaf growth and stem elongation.

The public kitchens built into this structure were destroyed in 1970 but soon restored and incorporated into the School of Industrial Art. An iron chain hangs at the entrance to this building's courtyard to force horseback riders to duck their heads. One of its most notable features resulted when its architect misheard the patron's request to include gold in the design, and the calligraphy on its interior is attributed to (*) Gubari. This building's central courtyard features a hexagonal fountain, and it is supported by huge pillars called the “elephant's feet.” One of the earliest buildings of its kind to have six minarets, it was designed by Sedefer Mehmed Aga at the request of Sultan Ahmed I. For 10 points, name this building in Istanbul nicknamed for the color of the tiles along its interior, the national mosque of Turkey.

This man built a plurality over Radomiro Tomic in an election culminating in the death of his general, René Schneider. The telex network from Operation Cybersyn helped develop his economy, which relied on the ITT and Anaconda Corporations. Project FUBELT targeted this man, whose advisor Carlos Prats put two bullets in the fender of a red sports car in a bizarre case of gender confusion, helping to trigger the (*) Tanquetazo putsch against this man. This man's government also weathered the Cuban Packages scandal and a strike at El Teniente, the world's largest copper mine. Jorge Alessandri opposed this man, who supposedly committed suicide after a 1973 coup. For 10 points, name this socialist leader of Chile overthrown by Augusto Pinochet.

Ponds and plateaus are formed irregularly from the Veiki type of this feature. Water fills the depressions in between the rogen or ribbed forms of these features, another form of which forms a dark streak as it runs down the edge of a valley. The medial and (*) recessional forms of these features are often found along with a better-known kind, collections of which can be found the Outer Lands or the Giant's Wall in Norway and which begin at the snout. Generally, these structures form from flour or debris and include the end, or terminal type. For 10 points, name these accumulations caused by glaciers.

Prior to receiving the darshana of Venkateswara at Tirupati, devotees perform this action as a symbol of their devotion to Balaji. In some regions, it is performed during the upanayana rite-of-passage ceremony, though a portion called the shikha is left intact in a practice called cudakarana. According to the Book of Leviticus, lepers had to undergo this action as a part of a (*) cleansing ritual. The principle of Kesh precludes the performance of this action by devout Sikhs, also forbidden for the Jewish Nazarite sect. The Book of Judges describes how a man was blinded and lost his strength after undergoing this at the hands of Delilah. For 10 points, identify this activity in which a keratinaceous tissue was removed from the head of Samson.
