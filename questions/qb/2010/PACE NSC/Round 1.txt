answer: the {Lombard} League

One of this entity's leaders formed the “Company of Death” that notably employed a war wagon known as the Carroccio. Founded through an oath taken at Pontida, this entity was left isolated following the defeat of a so-called “Commune” at Monte Porzio. This entity organized the Diet of Roncaglia and won its largest victory largely due to the lack of participation by (*) Henry the Lion, who chose instead to consolidate power in Saxony. This group won the Battle of Legnano against its major rival, who had earlier sacked Milan after a dispute with this group's major ally, Pope Alexander III.

answer: the {Watchmen}

One of these individuals became obsessed with Kitty Genovese and is seen with a sign reading “the end is nigh” before walking into Moloch's murder scene. Another drew from time spent in his father's watch repair shop after he was locked in the Intrinsic Field Subtractor, triggering a series of events that eventually leads to his self-imposed exile on (*) Mars. Cherenkov radiation accounts for the appearance of that figure, who discovers with Nite Owl that Ozymandias has orchestrated the deaths of millions to prevent nuclear war.

answer: {collagen}

A variety of this protein that appears primarily in interstitial tissue is associated with Ulrich myopathy, and mutation in a gene for its synthesis results in Alport syndrome. It is colored dark blue or green by Masson's trichrome stain. Peticchiae and gum bleeding in scurvy occur because vitamin (*) C helps synthesize this protein by hydroxylating certain amino acids. This protein, which is mineralized in the formation of bone, contains high levels of hydroxyproline and proline in its triple-helical structure. The most abundant mammalian protein is, for 10 points, what connective protein found in teeth, bone, and skin?

This phenomenon confers stability to the enol tautomer of beta-keto ketones as well as to dimerized carboxylic acids, while the strongest, symmetric form, occuring at around forty kilocalories per mole, is illustrated by the bifluoride ion. Different numbers of this phenomenon account for why the human genome contains about as many C bases as G bases. Responsible for (*) protein secondary structure like beta sheets, it lowers the volatility of and raises the heat of vaporization of water.

answer: {gravity} [or {gravitation}; accept obvious word forms]

Mordecai Milgrom has proposed a version of this interaction called MOND. The field theory of this interaction is non-renormalizable, which has led to such attempts to model this interaction as Roger Penrose's twistor theory. This interaction is thought to be mediated by a spin-2 massless boson, and experiments such as LISA intend to search for waves produced by this interaction, which deflects light in a process known as its namesake lensing effect. In the Newtonian regime its force is given by a universal constant times the product of the masses divided by the distance squared, and it is described on large scales by the general theory of relativity. For 10 points, identfiy this fundamental interaction arising from the attraction between massive objects.
