answer: nuclear {fission} [accept {chain reaction} before “{neutron}”; prompt {thereafter}]

With respect to this process, a “dollar” is the separation between states of prompt and delayed criticality. Tin appears to be the lightest element in which this process can be induced by gamma rays, and this process is spontaneous if the ratio Z squared over A is greater than or equal to forty-five. This process can be modeled by the six- or four-factor formula, both of which gives the effective (*) neutron multiplication factor. Reactors for this process are “poisoned” by the presence of elements like xenon. This process, which occurs in nuclei heavier than nickel-62, releases an amount of energy equal to the difference of product minus reactant binding energy. For 10 points, name this process by which a nucleus is split apart, often used on uranium-235.

One technique employs this phenomenon to determine the shape of macromolecules by measuring the change in polarization. This phenomenon leads to resonance energy transfer between closely separated groups in a lab technique to determine if two proteins naturally interact. This phenomenon in proteins can be quenched by glutamate or aspartate protons and is mostly exhibited by tryptophan residues. Membrane fluidity may be quantified in a technique called (*) FRAP that measures this phenomenon's resistance to photobleaching. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which light is absorbed at one wavelength and released at another, a process that is quicker than phosphorescence and which can cause objects to glow.
