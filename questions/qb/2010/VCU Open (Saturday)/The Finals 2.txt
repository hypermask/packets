answer: DNA {topoisomerases} [prompt on "{gyrase}"]

Compounds which inhibit the action of these enzymes include camptothecin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, and are thought to be powerful anti-neoplastic agents. Their active sites contain catalytic tyrosine residues, and they are responsible for decatenating interlinked chromosomes. These enzymes manage deviations from the ground state linking number which are induced by transcription bubbles and replication forks. In one mechanism for their action, known as strand passage, a double-stranded break is created and a different segment of DNA is passed through the gap. Another mechanism involves nicking a single strand of DNA and swiveling the other strand around the first, in a controlled rotation. These enzymes generally alter a strand's twist and writhe. For 10 points, name this class of enzymes which reduce torsional stress on strands of DNA by controlling supercoiling, thus altering the DNA's local topology.

answer: {Johann Christian Friedrich Hölderlin}

This writer described how “columns of leaves/burn and stir” next to the title object of a poem that opens with the exhortation “Now is the time for fire!” A character in another of his poems “balanced/the good gifts of the earth and united distant with near” and muses “Say, where is Athens?” Another of his poems wonders what the purpose of night is, save “holy drunkenness” and “frenzied oblivion,” and wonders “who wants poets at all in lean years?” This author of “The Archipelago” wrote a drama in which Hermocrates and Kritias, the ruler of Agrigentum, impel a philosopher to prove his godhood. Along with “Bread and Wine,” and that unfinished drama, The Death of Empedocles, this Hellenophile adapted his letters to Bellarmin and Diotima into an influential novel. For 10 points, name this Romantic author of “The Ister” and Hyperion, the favorite German poet of Nietzsche and Heidegger alike.

answer: Symphony of a {Thousand} [or {Mahler's} Symphony {No.} 8 in {E}-{flat major}]

One section of this symphony is sung by three repenting women who quote the Rose Chorus in their canon. It was originally planned to have concluded by contrasting the sacred nature of an adagio movement entitled “Caritas” with a setting of the pagan hymn “The Birth of Eros.” One of its movements is a setting of a Latin song written in the 9th century by Rabanus Maurus. The two movements of this symphony are connected by the “Accende lumen sensibus” theme, which comes from the fourth stanza of the hymn that its first movement is a setting of, the “Veni, creator spiritus.” This symphony was promoted and nicknamed by Emil Gutmann and its second movement includes a chorus of the Anchorites and soloists voicing the characters Doctor Marianus and Gretchen. It was inspired by Goethe's Faust and included three choirs at its premier. For 10 points, name this massive symphony of Gustav Mahler.

answer: {Karl Jaspers}

This man had a series of debates with Rudolf Bultmann about the role of mythology in Christianity. He defined certainty, incorrigibility, and impossibility of content as the three necessary components of a delusion in a work which brought phenomenological sensibilities to psychiatry and helped establish the Heidelberg School, his General Psychopathology. His work labeling “Socrates, Buddha, Confucius, Jesus” as the paradigmatic philosophers was published posthumously by his student Hannah Arendt. He contrasted Heidegger's concept of Dasein with Existenz as the two states of being, and saw his philosophy as a merger of the best parts of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. He wrote that although perpetrators of war crimes bore the brunt of the blame, all who stood idly by bore some responsibility for Nazi actions in The Question of German Guilt. In his book The Origin and Goal of History, he credited nascent religious ideas with the rise of civilizations between 800 and 200 BC. For 10 points, name this German existentialist and formulator of the Axial Age.

answer: Jean-Francois {Millet}

This artist first came to prominence in the salon with his Oedipus Taken down from the Tree. He painted a girl with a basket on her head and a boy carrying a bent three pronged pitchfork in his The Walk to Work. This artist depicted ladders leaned up against giant stacks of grain in the background of a lunching group in his painting of Ruth and Boaz. The contrast between the sale of one of this man's paintings and the poverty of his heirs was one of the main grounds for the creation of the droit de suite tax in the 1920s. That painting includes a pitchfork stuck into the ground and a wheelbarrow behind the bowed figures of two peasants and was originally called Prayer for the Potato Crop. Another of his paintings depicts three women bending down to collect scraps of grain from a field. For 10 points, name this Barbizon painter of The Angelus and The Gleaners.

Although not the time derivative, for Kelvin's theorem around a curve, this operator is applied to circulation and results in zero. When applied to total energy, this operator yields time change of heat and of work. The time rate of a property C within a volume fixed in space plus the net flux of the property C passing through a bounding surface is equal to this operator applied to the property C as seen in the Reynolds transport theorem. When this operator is applied on a field, it results in the time partial derivative of the field plus the velocity of the fluid dotted to the gradient of the field. For 10 points, name this operator denoted capital D divided by capital Dt with lowercase t that describes the time rate of change of a property of a fluid as it moves.

answer: {Huffman} algorithm or coding

This algorithm is most efficient when the probability of each input symbol is a negative power of two. Compared to other algorithms in coding theory, this algorithm is most efficient when combining truly random variables. If subtrees are kept on a priority queue by cumulative frequency, this algorithm needs to insert n+1 leaf frequencies onto the queue. It then repeatedly removes the two smallest elements from the queue, unites them into a subtree, and puts that subtree back into the queue, continuing until the queue contains the optimum tree. This technique uses fewer bits to encode more frequently occurring characters and more bits for less frequently occurring characters. For 10 points, name this entropy encoding algorithm used for lossless data compression, used in the audio codec mp3.

This thinker borrowed a phrase from Theodore Adorno's The Authoritarian Personality to term a phenomenon in which people mask “a profound if largely unconscious hatred of society” in empty vitriol as “The Pseudo-Conservative Revolt.” One book by this man introduced the study of “status anxiety” and argued that the New Deal differed from the Populist and Progressive movements because it was born out of economic hardship instead of prosperity. He claimed that the replacement of puritan with evangelical religion and the nature of Jacksonian egalitarianism were primary causes of a distrust of higher thought in American history. Another essay by this author of The Age of Reform traces anti-Freemason beliefs in nativist movements through the radical McCarthyism of his day to analyze the place of conspiracy theory in US politics. For 10 points, name this author of Anti-intellectualism in American Life and The Paranoid Style in American Politics.

This region's ancient history saw inhabitants named the Otomi build cities at Ranas and El Cerrito; later, one of their leaders, Conin converted to Catholicism, possibly due to the emergence of a Spanish priest holding up a fiery cross during a battle fought without weapons. A notable aqueduct was constructed here in 1736. During the Mexican War of Independence, a woman known as La Corregidora from here warned nearby rebels of an increased Spanish presence, leading to the issuance of the Grito de Dolores in a neighboring state. During the Mexican-American War, a partially namesake city within it served as the capital of Mexico, and the treaty of Guadelupe-Hidalgo was signed there. It is best known for being the site at which Maximilian I chose to fight the forces of Benito Juarez, leading to his capture. For 10 points, name this central Mexican state.
