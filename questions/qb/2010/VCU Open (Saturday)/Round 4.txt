answer: The {Ethics} of {Ambiguity}

This work's second section, titled "Personal Freedom and Others," quotes Descartes in saying that man's unhappiness is due to his first having been a child. It goes on to say that children live in a serious world without being serious themselves, and that some people, such as slaves who are never conscious of their own slavery, live their entire lives in this infantile mindset. Its third section argues that the title aesthetic attitude is a means of withdrawal from contemporary history and that true freedom must be found within oneself. It opens by quoting Montaigne that "The continuous work of our life is to build death." Written in response to Being and Nothingness, it posits six character types based on their levels of freedom. For 10 points, name this 1945 essay that followed its author's "Pyrrhus and Cineas," a work of Simone de Beauvoir.

This quantity is constant in the body frame of an object, but has a time dependence in the space frame given by the position times this quantity in the body frame times the inverse of the position. For a random object, finding this quantity involves taking the integral of an outer product. Half of the time derivative of this quantity is equal to the scalar virial. This quantity provides the coefficients of the axes in Poinsot's ellipsoid. Euler's equations has this quantity in a dot product with the time derivative of angular velocity. The products of this 2nd order symmetric tensor form the non-diagonal term in the tensor matrix while the principal ones of this tensor form the diagonal in the tensor matrix. Given this quantity for one axis, one can find it for another axis with the Parallel Axis theorem. For 10 points, name this quantity that for a hoop is one-half times mass times the radius of gyration.

During a low point in these two countries' diplomatic relations, one of them removed stelae surrounding a tortoise sculpture and covered the tortoise with cement to obscure the former presence of a writing system from the other one in its present-day territory. The same tensions between these two countries led one of them to build the “underground city” in its capital in expectation of a nuclear war. One of them had publicly denounced the other's leadership for comprising the “revisionist traitor group” and re-opened an old dispute over ownership of Damanskii Island in the Ussuri River, shortly after being alarmed by the Secret Speech. The other put forth the “peaceful coexistence” doctrine which led to these countries forming factions that included leaders such as Ethiopia's Mengistu Mariam on one side. For 10 points, identify these two countries which fell out in the late 1950s over the leadership of world Communism.

One of these texts sets out to explore "the constantly increasing power of science to keep the human body alive for longer than any reasonable person would want to inhabit it" and refers to the equal competence of "nine people picked at random from the Kansas City telephone directory." One of these subjects of a Kevin Ring book addresses golf carts, suggesting that it would be best to "decline to answer this incredibly difficult and incredibly silly question," while another, about abortion, notes that "Lord Acton did not say 'Power tends to purify.'" In reference to the departure from the majority's attitude to precedent in that case, a later one claims that the author's colleagues have "largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda" and announces "the Court has taken sides in the culture war." They opposed the majority in such cases as Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Lawrence v. Texas. Frequently joined by Samuel Alito or Clarence Thomas, these are, for 10 points, what Supreme Court opinions, delivered by a noted conservative Justice?

answer: {myoglobin}

This protein may be evolutionarily conserved due to its ability to oxidize bioactive nitric oxide to nitrate. Malignant hyperthermia and McArdle's disease cause it to be present in urine. The majority of this protein, which is composed of a single, 153-residue polypeptide, consists of eight distinct right-handed alpha-helices with a central hydrophobic cleft. It has a Hill coefficient of 1, indicating non-cooperative binding of its major substrate, and displays a hyperbolic dissociation curve with that substrate. Knockout mice deficient in this appear non-different from wild-types, as they compensate by developing increased capillarity, while it is present in especially high levels for diving mammals. Its pigments create the red color of meat, and this protein releases bound oxygen at a lower partial pressure than its tetrameric counterpart. For 10 points, name this monomeric protein which increases the solubility of oxygen within muscle tissue.

The precedent for these events was the 1880 Treaty of Madrid claiming joint European regulation of the affairs of a certain country. During the first one of these, General Francois de Negrier found that most corps in his country did not have their full complements while President Emile Loubet accepted the resignation of his Foreign Secretary. That one began after Bernhard von Bulow told his king to visit a certain city following the nationalist Theodore Delcasse's announcement that his country would regulate customs and trade in a certain country. It was a serious threat to France because France's ally Russia was then at war with Japan. The second one saw David Lloyd George claim that national honor was more important than peace in the Mansion House Speech. That one began after the gunboat Panther was deployed, while the first was settled at the Algeciras Conference. Designed by Germany to test the strength of the Entente Cordiale, for 10 points, name these events that happened at Agadir and Tangiers.

One 18th century virtuoso of this instrument was Friedrich Pischelberger, for whom Mozart wrote his Per questa bella mano. The “Romance” section of Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kije Suite sees it play the main melody, and in 1874 Franz Simandl published his New Method of this instrument. Giovanni Bottesini is often called the “Paganini of” this instrument, which is either played with a “French” or “German” hand position, the latter of which was popularized by the 19th century virtuoso Domenico Dragonetti. The subject of several concertos by conductor and player Sergei Koussevitzky, it is the only instrument in its orchestral family tuned in fourths rather than fifths. It also unusually appears as the fifth instrument in Schubert's Trout Quintet and it accompanies the piano in The Carnival of the Animal's fifth movement, “The Elephant.” Usually played sitting on a stool or standing up, this is, for 10 points, what largest and lowest-pitched string instrument?

answer: {gluconeogenesis}

In this pathway, dihydroxyacetone phosphate undergoes an aldol condensation with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The second step of this pathway is carried out by an enzyme requiring both magnesium and manganese ions, which first decarboxylates then phosphorylates oxaloacetate. The enzyme carrying out its rate-limiting step is activated by citrate and inhibited by high levels of cyclic AMP. The first molecule to enter this pathway may be created from the catabolism of amino acids, or from lactate after it undergoes the first half of the Cori cycle. This process occurs to a limited extent in the kidneys, although the majority happens within the liver. Its unique enzymes include fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate carboxylase, and PEP carboxykinase. For 10 points, identify this pathway consisting mainly of a reversal of glycolysis, which synthesizes glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.

This poem prescribes, for the “mortals that delve in this trade-ridden planet,” a figure who will satisfy your “Egyptian devotion to ices.” One character likes to “rattle away till he's as old as Methusaleh/At the head of a march to the last new Jerusalem.” Its final stanza discusses the repetition of “beyond and above” and ends describing shepherds tracing “the last spurning print of a sky-cleaving god.” This poem discusses the “Spirit of Ancient Poetry,” and contains the simile of “gold nails in temples to hang trophies on.” Characters described in this poem include one who has “the fun of Dick Steele” and another who, much like “Barnaby Rudge” is three-fifths genius and two-fifths fudge. Using wordplay to discuss “Whinier,” “Bryant,” “Poe,” and “Cooper,” for 10 points, name this satirical work by James Russell Lowell.
