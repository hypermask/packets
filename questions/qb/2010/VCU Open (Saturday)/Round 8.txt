answer: {Quasi-War}

One phase of this conflict saw an assault on Puerto Plata that led to the sinking of the Sandwich and the destruction of Spanish guns in the coastal fortress.

answer: {El Nino} [or {Southern Oscillation} or {El Nino/La Nina}-{Southern Oscillation}]

Salisbury and Wimbush studied the prediction of these events, using the Hilbert-Huang transform to determine whether the seasonal fluctuations in air pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin were sufficiently noise free to do so. Like global warming, this event leads to an increase in vertical wind shear, which can prevent hurricanes from forming. The most intense of these events marked the start of mass coral bleaching worldwide, and it is caused by the slowing of the Walker Circulation. That same event temporarily warmed air temperatures by 1.5 degrees Celsius, approximately six times the normal increase, and this event reduces the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water off the coast of Peru. For 10 points, name this warming of the surface water in the East Pacific, often associated with increased hurricane strength.

answer: {CO2} [or carbon {dioxide}]

A supercritical fluid of this molecule has been studied for use as a homogeneous solvent, and one method to increase solubility of compounds in that solution is to introduce perfluoroalkyl groups. It reacts favorably with serpentine minerals, and the slow rate of that reaction can be increased greatly through the use of a microwave furnace. It can be reacted with hydrogen to form water in the Bosch reaction, which can be used to create graphite samples for carbon dating, and it can be used to produce a carboxyllic acid when reacted with a magnesium halide. When dissolved in blood, it increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, a result known as the Bohr effect, and it is temporarily added to pyruvate to form oxaloacetate at the start of gluconeogenesis by a biotin-containing enzyme. For 10 points, name this molecule which is added to ribulose bisphosphate in the Calvin cycle in a reaction catalyzed by RuBisCO.
