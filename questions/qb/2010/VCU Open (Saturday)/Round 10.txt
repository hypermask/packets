Evidence suggests that one organism in this phylum introduced the parasite Haplosporidium nelsoni to the Chesapeake Bay. That organism is Crassostrea gigas. The laterofrontal cirri of the ctenidia in this phylum filter and retain particles. Some organisms in this phylum use byssal threads to attach themselves to a substrate. Filter feeders in this phylum excrete pseudofeces and notably lack a toothed chitinous ribbon. Important features of this phylum include an extension of the body wall which is often responsible for secreting a calcium carbonate shell, the mantle, as well as the radula. For 10 points, name this phylum containing the classes Gastropoda and Bivalvia, examples of which are snails and mussels.

answer: {Fresnel} diffraction [accept {near}-{field diffraction} before mention]

This phenomenon is used in devices that use quantum reflection and ridges at a specific grazing angle to reflect individual particles. In addition to its use in ridged atomic mirrors, this phenomenon uses a namesake approximation that only applies when the angle involved in this happening is small. This phenomenon only occurs when the square of the aperture size divided by the distance to the aperture from a screen and the wavelength is greater than or approximately one. It occurs because incident waves that have been diffracted already propagate themselves. For 10 points, name this sort of diffraction which happens when its namesake number is greater than one, also called near-field diffraction.

answer: {Arthur Eddington}

This man wrongly calculated the number of protons in the universe, and with Dirac he found the coincidence that many ratios of related quantities give unitless numbers on the order of 10 to the 40th power. In more legitimate work, his discovery that stars move in two different “drifts” was important in studying the proper motion of stars and in finding an explanation to the pulsing of Cepheid Variables. He discovered the relationship between mass and luminosity in stars and used a total eclipse to verify that light is bent by gravity as predicted by relativity. He attempted to prove that the fine structure constant is equal to 1/136, later changing the proof to accommodate the closer 1/137. For 10 points, name this scientist who gives his name to the point where a star would break up due to radiation pressure exceeding gravitational attraction, his namesake limit.

Two knights returning from Lithuanian crusades, Gaston Phebus and Captal de Buchand, inflicted a decisive defeat on this movement by relieving the siege of Meaux where a number of notable ladies were hiding. Amiens and Rouen were two sites that received speedy royal pardons after it concluded, thanks in part to their loyalty to the Navarre family. A one-sided battle at Mello crushed its organized military wing after its main leader, Guillame Cale, was murdered at a parlay with Charles the Bad and the Mayor of Paris, Etienne Marcel, was killed for lending tacit support to it. This uprising was prompted by higher taxes levied on the lower estates to help pay for the ransom of John the Good.

In one work, this thinker advocated a view of ideas as tools for apprehending reality and lacking in any self-arising value. That work was organized in terms of observations he called “probes” from which lines of thought could be drawn. He also wrote a work which uses King Lear as a lone example of three-dimensional perspective and the process of “denudation” between separate worlds of “roles” and “jobs”. That work also analyzes Finnegan's Wake as a history of human writing and speech and theorizes that geographical culture imbalances will disappear with the formation of a “global village”.

answer: {Schiff Base} [or {imine}]

One of these is central to the decarboxylation of beta-keto acids by acetoacetate decarboxylase, as its formation allows the decarboxylation to proceed without a charged intermediate. Another instance of this group is central to the mechanism of aldolase in glycolysis. One of these forms the linkage between 11-cis-retinal and opsin to form rhodopsin, and breaks when light isomerizes that molecule. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate, a derivative of vitamin B6, forms one of these structures in aspartate aminotransferase when its aldehyde group binds to a lysine residue.
