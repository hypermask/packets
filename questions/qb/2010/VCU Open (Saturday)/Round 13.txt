answer: Battle of {Bennington}

The encirclement strategy of the winning side in this battle was supported by the efforts of Colonels Nichols and Herrick as well as the tactic of disguising themselves as the enemy's supporters by attaching pieces of paper to their hats. The losing side's commander had halted his advance at the Walloomsac River after realizing that he was outnumbered; once he realized his imminent defeat, he led a futile sabre charge during which he was slain. That man, Friedrich Baum, was not in time to receive reinforcements led by Heinrich von Breymann, who might have been able to turn the tide had it not been for the timely arrival of Seth Warner and his Vermont militia. Those militia were also known as the Green Mountain Boys, and Molly Stark would have slept a widow if her husband John had not won this American victory in eastern New York. For 10 points, name this battle from the Revolutionary War.

answer: {Paris}, {France}

The suburbs of this city were home to Eugene Freyssinet's massive shell-shaped aircraft hangars, and other no longer extant buildings in this city include Contamin and Dutert's massive steel "Machine Hall" designed for its 1889 world's fair. This city is home to Corbusier's "Weekend House," and its 1937 exposition prompted the construction of its "Museum of Man" and Alvar Aalto's legendary Finnish Pavilion. This city still enforces its "alignement" law which restricts building height based on road width. One building in this city includes a "grand foyer" lined with symmetrical golden chandeliers which lead to the Grand Staircase. In addition to that building designed by Charles Garnier, this city is home to a museum whose curved, glass paneled ceiling remains from its time as a railway station, as well as a museum to which I M Pei added glass pyramids. For 10 points, name this city that is home to the Musée d'Orsay and the Louvre.

answer: {Active} Galactic {Nuclei} [prompt on {Seyfert galaxies} or {BL Lac objects} before {galactic centers}; prompt on {Quasars} or {Quasi}-{Stellar Radio Sources} or {Blazars}]

Until 2004, there was no spectroscopic proof that one type of these objects contained the 10 micrometer and 18 micrometer infrared spectral features caused by silicate dust. These bodies are surrounded by asymmetric toroidal structures that cause anisotropic obscuration, and the smoothness of the broad-line region in NGC 4395 suggests that the broad-line region of these objects originates from a single continuous flow. They can be classified as Type I or Type II based on the width of their spectral lines or how they are viewed, but are more commonly divided into radio-quiet and radio-loud types. Powered by an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole, for 10 points, name these compact galactic centers that emit massive amounts of electromagnetic radiation.

answer: {micelles}

These structures can be formed from block copolymers made of styrene and ethylene oxide. At temperatures around 60 to 70 Celsius, they interact with each other less than at lower temperatures, due to a slight change of shape. They tend to form for molecules which have a packing parameter of less than one-half. Above the cloud point, solutions of Triton X-100 separate into phases rich and poor in the concentration of these structures. Computer simulations have shown that examples of these structures which are large enough to be unstable split through the formation of a stalk. For 10 points, name these structures that form at a critical concentration of surfactants, which have hydrophobic tails clumped in the center and head groups surrounding the outside.

answer: The {Swimming Hole}

The leftmost figure in this painting mimics the posture of the Dying Gaul and lies next to a man who is resting on his knees and has his left hand extended into the air. Displaying many themes found in its artist's earlier work Arcadia, this painting also depicts an open meadow in the right background and the artist's Irish Setter, Harry, who is attempting to get to the shore on the left. It was originally commissioned by Edward Coates for an annual exhibition, but due to its controversial nature it was replaced with another work that shows two seated musicians and a woman holding a piece of paper; that work is The Pathetic Song. A man with his hands on his hips stands upon a rock and looks down as another man dives into the titular locale; both of those figures, as well as everyone else in this painting, is naked. Several of the artist's students are depicted near a lake in, for 10 points, what painting by Thomas Eakins?

answer: "The {Interlopers} "

One scene in this story sees a character manage to unscrew a flask of wine and take a sip from it; the result is described as "a Heaven-sent draught." He then has the sudden idea to try and toss the flask to his companion, but the companion refuses both out of spite and because he claims that his eyes are too full of blood to see properly. Set "In a forest of mixed growth somewhere on the eastern spurs of the Karpathians," it focuses on Ulrich von Gradwitz and Georg Znaeym, two men part of a family feud that goes back several generations. It is only after they become trapped under a fallen beech tree that they become friends, but their cries for help attract the title characters, who are revealed to be wolves. For 10 points, name this short story by Saki.

A mutation affecting the transport of boron into this structure causes a type of boron deficiency. Its evolutionary ambiguity is hinted at by the fact that the genera Equisetum and Regnellidum possess these, while those in the family Winteraceae do not. Organisms that possess this structure can be classified as exarch or endarch based on its growth, and the chemical auxin has been found to limit the differentiation of this structure. Its primary type contains its pro- and meta- forms, and its secondary type grows out of ray and fusiform initials. Gymnosperms possess the tracheids associated with this structure, but lack the vessel elements that are only found in angiosperms. For 10 points, name this type of plant tissue that consists of dead cells, which primarily transports water.

answer: Second Battle of {El}-{Alamein}

One key action during this battle was the capture of Point 29 by the 26th Australian Brigade, which was the site of intense fighting for several days. The aggressors managed to capture the Miteirya Ridge, but, after a battle fought near a depression known as Kidney Ridge, they mistakenly thought that they had reached the Pierson Line. The defender's counterattack led to combat around Thompson's Post after their commander arrived on the battlefront from Europe. That commander realized that this battle was lost after the sinking of the Tripolino, Ostia, and Proserpina, three ships that were to refuel his forces. An earlier battle at this site saw Claude Auchinleck repulse an Axis advance, though it was the second battle fought here at which Bernard Montgomery defeated Erwin Rommel. For 10 points, name this World War Two battle fought 66 miles from Alexandria.

answer: {firms}

Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz argue that this theoretical construct is a way to deal with metering costs and relies on the residual income of a monitor to be effective. Benjamin Klein used the example of Fischer Body to show how this construct helped solve the hold-up problem and naturally led to vertical integration. Oliver Williamson described the principal-agent problem facing these constructs and believed that these constructs would be limited by delegation and the decreasing incentive returns of additional residual income. Another paper suggests measuring the size of these entities by looking at the number of internal and external relations, and explains why they have emerged in the place of independently acting entrepreneurs. For 10 points, minimizing transaction costs is the primary purpose proposed by Ronald Coase in his 1937 work on "The Nature of" what basic business entity?

answer: {Theory} of {Moral Sentiments}

This work observes that "We suffer more… when we fall from a better to a worse situation, than we ever enjoy when we rise from a worse to a better. Security, therefore, is the first and principal object of prudence." It goes on to define attributes of the prudent man, including his propensity for friendship and his sincerity, and comments on how Cesar Borgia's luring of four princes to their deaths under a flag of truce is viewed as less contemptuous than the actions of a petty thief because the petty thief possesses foolishness in addition to his other vices. Those arguments appear in its sixth section, "Of the Character of Virtue." It opens with the observation that man possesses an inherent altruism, and, in the footsteps of its author's mentor, Frances Hutcheson, categorizes the nature and motive of morality. For 10 points, name this work of Adam Smith.

answer: {phospholipase} C

The avian sarcoma virus genome codes for protein p47, which has a high degree of homology to this enzyme. Its activity is stimulated by gustducin, and this protein's gamma subtype is phosphorylated by T-cell receptors. Aluminum toxicity in plants occurs in response to inhibition of this enzyme. It is activated via stimulation of its SH2 domain, subsequently activating protein kinase C in many cases. This protein can disrupt the GPI anchors that attach membrane proteins to the lipid bilayer. It differs from other enzymes in its class in that it cleaves phosphodiester bonds in a location immediately adjacent to the phosphorus atom. Most commonly splitting PIP2 into diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate is, for 10 points, what enzyme that generally breaks up phospholipids?
