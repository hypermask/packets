answer: {corpus callosum}

Agenesis of this structure during fetal development leads to eversion of the cingulate gyrus and the formation of Probst bundles. It contains both heterotopic and homotopic connections, and diffusion tensor imaging has been used to identify regions including the rostrum, genu, and splenium. This structure is not found in either marsupials or monotremes; in humans it is important for bimanual motor coordination. Gazzaniga and Sperry studied the effects of damage to it, which it can lead to disconnection syndrome or alien hand syndrome. The condition caused by completely severing the axons in this structure is called "split brain," and it is bisected as a last resort to treat patients with severe multifocal epilepsy. For 10 points, identify this structure, the brain's largest white matter tract, which connects the left and right cerebral hemispheres.

answer: Ernst {Mach}

The adoption of this person's metaphysics by Alexander Bogdanov led Vladimir Lenin to write a chapter in Materialism and Empirico-Criticism accusing this philosopher and Richard Avenarius of being solipsists. His anti-atomism was rooted in a skepticism about unobservable entities, while his general philosophy of science proposed that theories develop from a human drive toward economy. The strict empiricism exhibited in his history of physics, The Science of Mechanics, was extended to giving sense-perception the sole role in driving science in his The Analysis of Sensations. His empiricist approach influenced the formation of the Vienna Circle, which was formally known as this man's "society." For 10 points, name this philosopher, who also worked as a psychologist, explaining an optical illusion known as his "bands," and a physicist, doing work on the speed of sound that included defining his "number."

answer: {pions} [accept {pi meson}; prompt on {meson}]

This class of particles is not massless because they are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from chiral symmetry being spontaneously broken. Many grand unification theories require protons to decay into a positron and the neutral form of this class of particles. The negative form of this usually decays into an muon and an anti-muon neutrino. It was wrongly predicted to be the carrier of the strong force by Yukawa. The neutral form of this type of particle can decay into a photon and an electron-positron pair in the Dalitz decay, though more commonly decays into just two photons. While the neutral form of this with zero spin weighs around 135MeV, the positive form of this is made of an up and a down antiquark. For 10 points, name these lightest mesons.

One man involved in this conflict was the ex-CIA agent John Mepples Espirito, who told Cuban authorities he had been authorized to incite it as part of "Operation Pantomime." Key figures involved in this conflict included Mariano Ospina, Laureano Gómez, and Gustavo Rojas. This civil war shattered the fragile peace that had been established after the War of a Thousand Days and claimed over two hundred thousand lives. This conflict officially ended after the Sitges and San Carlos agreements established a sixteen-year coalition government known as the National Front, but some of the more radical left-wing militias did not disarm and later merged into the still-active FARC. For 10 points identify this conflict that began with a series of riots called the Bogotazo after the assassination of Jorge Elicer Gaitan, a ten-year civil war between the Liberal and Conservative parties in Colombia that began in 1948.

answer: {Córdoba}

This city was the site of a feud between Dunash ben Labrat and Menahem ben Sharuk, who compiled the first dictionary of Hebrew and Aramaic and pioneered work on Hebrew grammar. One resident of this city carried out the Khazar Correspondence with Joseph ben Aaron, and that man was the minister Hasdai Ibn Shaprut who controlled much of its day to day business in the 10th century. This city's synagogue became a rabies hospital and contains a statue of Maimonides, who was born here. Because it was originally constructed as the Visigothic Church of St. Steven, its Aljama Mosque mosque faces south instead of towards Mecca. That mosque is known simply as the Mezquita and was begun by Abd ar-Rahman I, who founded the Umayyad branch that ruled this city until it dissolved and was sacked by Almoravids.

In one work, this man showed the divergence of the asymptotic series of log z! [z factorial] proposed by James Stirling and Abraham de Moivre, the latter of which may have tutored him. Although he used the pseudonym John Noon to publish his non-mathematical Divine Benevolence, he is more famous for a work that was published after his death thanks to the efforts of his friend Richard Price. In 1736, he published an attack on George Berkeley's The Analyst entitled An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions. George Boole criticized his Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances, which introduced his best known concept and laid the groundwork for his namesake probability. For 10 points, name this British mathematician whose namesake theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of B divided by the probability of A.

Late in this ruler's career, he was targeted by a failed plot led by Kaulza de Arraiga as well as an uprising that formed in Obidos and was led by Vitor Alves and Vasco Lourenco, the Movimento dos Capitaes. One event during his tenure was the assassination of Amilar Cabral, the leader of the PAIGC, and the subsequent granting of independence to Guinea-Bissau. He dealt with the increasing power of president Americo Tomas, and, though he legalized opposition parties, he was unable to enact any real liberalizing reforms. His eventual successor, Antonio de Spinola, whom had earlier been dispatched to Angola, came to power after a relatively bloodless coup on April 25th, 1974; that event was known as the Carnation Revolution.

One variant of this process used for volatile compounds involves spraying a solution into a chamber counter to the flow of a gas. It is not chromatography, but a process which uses an intermediate adsorption stage is known as its thin layer version. Common graphs seen in their design include triangular phase diagrams, shaped either with a 90 degree angle between the axes or as an equilateral triangle. When determining the number of stages needed in this process a key step is the construction of a “delta point,” and one of the exit streams is called the raffinate. When carried out in a lab, this process generally involves repeated shaking and venting of the glass container. For 10 points, name this process in which an immiscible solvent is added to a system in order to separate one component from another based on solubility.
