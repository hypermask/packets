answer: Gerrit {Rietveld}

One of this man's buildings is connected by “the Node” to an Exhibition Wing added in 1999 by Kisho Kurokawa. Because of the long black board that makes up both its support and its back, this architect's Berlin Chair is often called the “plank chair,” and both that chair and his Steltman Chair are asymmetrical and produced with right and left hand versions. This architect of Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum connected four boards to form his “Zig-Zag” chair. His namesake joint consists of three battens overlapping in three directions, and he used this construction in his “Red and Blue Chair.” One of this man's buildings includes several partitions which can be open or closed to customize the living experience. That house is located in Utrecht and has been called “a cardboard Mondrian,” as it exemplifies De Stijl architecture. For 10 points, name this designer of the Schroder House.

answer: {Green Fluorescent} Protein

Mutations of this protein include a TCD version that resisted gene silencing and a redox variant that contains reversible disulfide cross-links. A 2010 study introduced azatryptophan into this molecule to study effects of protein folding. Alba was the name of a controversial rabbit that was supposedly infused with this protein. It has a beta-barrel shape, in the middle of which is a serine-tyrosine-glycine sequence that gives this protein its function. It has been extracted from the sea pansy, as well as from Aequorea victoria, a jellyfish.

answer: The {Concept} of {Mind}

One section of this text examines the use of an "index word" to convey various scenarios, such as "collid[ing] with the police car," "warming myself before the fire," and "ca[tching] myself beginning to dream." That section equates introspection with retrospection, describes "higher-order actions" criticizing "lower-action" ones, and concludes that "No metaphysical Iron Curtain exists compelling us to be forever absolute strangers to one another." In line with that thought, its author earlier discusses "disposition" and "occurrence" words and later dismisses imagination as simply playing in a theater box. It opens with the claim that to confuse the discourse of bodies and the discourse of the title entities is to imagine the title entity as a "ghost in the machine." For 10 points, identify this work of metaphysical philosophy by Gilbert Ryle.

answer: {Ackermann} function

This function provides the theoretical justification of "zeration" and it also demonstrates the existence of an infinite series of hyperoperations through its recurrence relation. Any sequence of m union-find operations on a set of size n takes m times alpha of n time, where alpha is the inverse of this function. This function is the diagonalization of the Grzegorczyk (zuh-gor-cich) hierarchy and is the most famous function that cannot be implemented using only do loops. Its most well known form was developed by Rozsa Peter and Raphael Robinson and is known as the two-variable version. For 10 points, name this simplest example of a well-defined total function that is Turing computable but not primitive recursive, often shown as A of m comma n.

answer: {nitric} acid

This compound can be used in rocket propellants, and corrosion of metal by it can be inhibited by phosphorous pentafluoride or a small amount of hydrogen fluoride. Another early process to produce this compound involved blowing air through an arc furnace at temperatures greater than 3000 °C, cooling the products, and bringing them into contact with water, and was developed by Birkeland and Eyde. It is commonly added to solutions to remove unwanted ions which react with silver nitrate in a test for halide ions. It has two “fuming” forms; it appears white when highly concentrated, and red when an additional precursor is added to the solution. For 10 points, name this strong acid which is formed in the Ostwald Process and can be used with sulfuric acid to add an NO2 group to an aromatic ring.

This century featured an account of Byzantium complaining about its brackish water, despite the fact that its author, Liutprand of Cremona, was a guest of the Emperor. Liutprand also wrote about Marozia, who married Sergius III and put John XI in the papacy. In the Sixteenth century, Cardinal Baronius dubbed this century the Iron or Leaden century and it also saw the existence of the Saeculum obscurum or the Pornocracy. Poland under Mieszko I converted to Christianity, and Kievan Rus followed shortly after. Seeing the foundation of Cluny and the forced marriage of Adelaide of Italy lead to an invasion by a man who would spawn a namesake renaissance, this century also saw the end of the Carolingian dynasty. For 10 points, name this century that was the darkest of the Dark Ages, which saw the establishment of the Ottonian and Capetian dynasties, and preceded the century that saw the First Crusade and the Norman invasion of England.
