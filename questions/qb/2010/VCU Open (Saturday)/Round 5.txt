answer: {Parc Güell}

A house designed by Francesc Berenguer can be found at the entrance of this location, which also contains four sun mosaics on a ceiling supported by 86 Doric columns. Other features of it are a large cross atop the Closed Chapel at its highest point and walkways residing between twisting stone columns. Two mechanical gazelles once adorned its entrance, directly in front of which lie two massive staircases leading to the plaza Sala Hipóstila and a multicolored dragon statue. The architect's friend Josep Marià Jujol implemented imprints of buttocks in his design of the bench that surrounds this complex, which was originally intended to be a living community containing 60 houses. Although its architect was also commissioned by its namesake for a church and a mansion, this complex more closely resembles its architect's later projects such as the Casa Milà. For 10 points, name this park in Barcelona designed by Antoni Gaudí.

answer: {Irving Langmuir}

This man's work with nitrogen-filled incandescent light bulbs led to coiling the filaments to slow blackening, and he gives his name to the small boundary layer around the filament in which conductive dominates convective heat transfer. This man co-names a model for the rate of reaction on a catalyst in which all reactants adsorb onto surface sites before reacting, and he sometimes partially names a mechanism in which one molecule reacts while still in the gas phase. A related equation he derived can be used in situations where the Freundlich one does not apply, his namesake adsorption isotherm. For 10 points, name this scientist who also co-discovered rapid oscillations of electrons in plasmas, his namesake “waves.”

answer: The {Fall} [or La {Chute}]

This novel's protagonist describes traveling between the countless islands in “the Greek archipelago” before catching himself being too lyrical. One character punches that narrator in the side of the head after refusing to move his stalled motorcycle off-road at a stoplight. The yells of a suicidal woman in black do not faze the narrator, who obtains an object exchanged for a bottle of jenever. That owner of a panel from The Just Judges meets Du Guesclin in a concentration camp he was put in after being captured in North Africa, where he is reminded of a lingering laughter he was haunted by while contemplating the similarity of Hell to the concentric circles of Amsterdam. Set in the bar Mexico City, where an unnamed listener converses with Clamence, for 10 points, identify this novel by Albert Camus.

In one major gaff, this politician contrasted his wife holding a koala in California to his own holding of “samples from a toxic-waste dump” in New Jersey. This man pioneered the strategy of focusing on the Iowa Caucus as the campaign manager for the George McGovern campaign. In his first campaign for his party's nomination, his opponent quoted a Wendy's commercial in asking him “Where's the beef?” In a later campaign, this politician challenged reporters to “Follow me around” after rumors of an extra-marital affair, which were confirmed when the Miami Herald published a photograph of him wearing a Monkey Business t-shirt and holding the model Donna Rice in his lap. Those gaffs contributed to his primary losses to Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis respectively. For 10 points, name this Colorado politician and Democratic loser of the 1984 and 1988 primaries.

answer: The {Magnificent Ambersons}

An innovative scene in the film of this name is a backward tracking shot which passes through four rooms as it portrays the conversations of various people at a ball. Actors for the film were rocked up and down on planks on the studio roof to realistically dub dialogue for a sleigh ride in a horseless carriage. In the novel of this name, one character sees a psychic after he and Lucy both have visions of Isabel, and Fanny disastrously stakes all her money in a headlight investment. In the film, Wilbur Minafer marries Isabel, whose death causes a tragic speech by the “Major” which was intended to dissolve to the image of two gravestones in a scene cut by RKO. In the novel, the inventor Eugene Morgan's success with automobiles contrasts with the declining fortunes of the title family in a town based on Indianapolis. For 10 points, name this novel by Booth Tarkington which was adapted by Orson Welles.

A proof that the set of integers under a certain stopping time has a limiting density is important in analyzing this problem. That proof was introduced by Riho Terras, whose notable modification of this problem introduces a one-half term and yields similar results. Sometimes associated with Helmut Hasse, it was the subject of Paul Erdos's quote that “mathematics is not yet ready for such problems.” In 2008, Tomàs Oliveira e Silva expanded on earlier work by showing that this problem holds for all positive integers up to 5.48 times 10 to the 18th power. At least one of four cycles occur when negative numbers are introduced, while the sequence 4, 2, 1 always appears at end of the “hailstone” numbers, the sequence of numbers produced when this problem is applied to a positive integer. For 10 points, name this unsolved mathematical conjecture which states that any positive integer n will approach one after undergoing the iteration n over two if n is even or three n plus one if n is odd.

Johann I, the Prince of Lichtenstein and Ignác Gyulai signed this treaty for the losing side. The year before this treaty was signed, the successor of the Cisalpine Republic became the Kingdom of Italy led by the Viceroy Eugene. In this treaty, the Kingdom of Italy gained Istria, Dalmatia, and Venetia. One side gave up all claims to Baden and Bavaria, and this treaty was followed up by the creation of a state led by the Prince Primate Karl Theodor von Dalberg. This treaty was signed after a victory which saw Marshal Soult storm up Pratzen Heights to split the enemy into two after the enemy tried to attack the weakened French left. Leading to the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine, for 10 points, name this 1806 treaty signed in the aftermath of the Battle of Austerlitz that ended the Holy Roman Empire.

answer: {Isaiah Berlin}

This man explained what pluralism was in his lecture "The Pursuit of the Ideal;" he had earlier tackled that subject in "Some Procrustations" and "Democracy, Communism, and the Individual." He argued that determinism arose from the psychological need to create an alibi rather than by any semblance of factual evidence in his essay "Historical Inevitability." He believed that romanticism was part of a movement he dubbed the "Counter-Enlightenment," and it was Giambattista Vico, Johann Herder, and Johann Hamann who titled his collection Three Critics of the Enlightenment. In a better known essay, he contended that Leo Tolstoy straddled the line between thinkers who focus on a single idea and those who draw from a wider variety of sources. For 10 points, name this author of "The Hedgehog and the Fox" and "Two Concepts of Liberty."

answer: {GABA} [{also} accept {gamma}-{aminobutyric acid}]

Drugs blocking the synthesis of this neurotransmitter include allylglycine and thiosemicarbazide, while tiagabine selectively inhibits its Type 1 transporters. The striatum's medium spiny neurons, basket and stellate cells, and many other cortical interneurons primarily release this neurotransmitter. Its major agonist, produced from mushrooms of the genus Amanita, is muscimol, while its antagonists include picrotoxin and bicuculline, both of which can induce seizures. This compound is synthesized in a single step by glutamic acid decarboxylase, from glutamate. The effects of this neurotransmitter are potentiated by drugs with anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. Glycine has similar effects to this molecule, and stimulation of this neurotransmitter's type A receptors opens chloride ion channels, which hyperpolarize the neuron. For 10 points, identify this primary inhibitory neurotransmitter.

The first step of this process can occur via electron capture and creates discrete spectral lines of neutrinos at 1.44MeV as compared to the usual spectral lines of 0.42MeV for this process. Part of the solution to the neutrino problem comes from the fact that this process can generate neutrinos with 14.06MeV. This process may create beryllium, which then becomes lithium via electron capture. The first step of this process usually takes 109 years as the Coulomb potential is difficult to overcome via tunneling and the weak force. The second step of this process sees the formation of helium-3 from deuterium, which is made from the first step. For 10 points, name this process that creates helium-4 from four hydrogen atoms and that generates most of the energy in the Sun.

In a supplement to this work, its author cited the influence of Beveridge's Private Thoughts and The Force of Truth by Thomas Scott, “who made a deeper impression” on his mind than any other. The author compares his life to that of the protagonist of his novel Loss and Gain, who also searches in vain for a via media, or middle way. Though the author recants the “hard things” he has said against Rome, he does not fail to acknowledge that Monophysitism had made him question Anglicanism, asking whether or not Roman Interpretation could be applied to the Thirty-Nine Articles. Describing the events of 1830 and its author's boyhood days at Oriel College, this autobiography was a response to criticism levied by Charles Kingsley. For 10 points, identify this spiritual autobiography written by the author of “The Dream of Gerontius,” Cardinal Newman.

After agreeing to wear a ring belonging to a central character of this work, Toto Brunel is stabbed to death at a carnival with a hatpin. One section of this work is largely composed of the “Interlinear,” notes written between the lines of the protagonist's manuscript. That protagonist reads Arnauti's novel Moeurs and attends a duck hunt at Lake Mareotis where Paul Capodistria is shot. In the last work in this series, the protagonist is forced to cut off his lover's hand when a harpoon accidentally fired by Balthazar pinned it underwater. Percy Pursewarden commits suicide when he learns about his accidental complicity in Nessim Hosnani's plot, which is suppressed by the diplomat David Mountolive.

This thinker opened one paper with the premise that people should be allowed to have pink walls and sleep on their bellies regardless of the feelings of society. His most recent book length work argues that institutions can have varying degrees of justice, instead of either reaching or failing to reach the platonic ideal of justice proposed in Rawles' A Theory of Justice. He used the example of two people reading Lady Chatterly's Lover in a paper which argues for “The Impossibility of a Paretian Liberal” and contains the first formulation of the Liberal Paradox. He argued for levels of personal liberty as a more accurate marker than GNP in his book Development as a Freedom, and targeted gender inequality as the reason “More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing.” For 10 points, name this Indian welfare economist who argued that distributional rather than supply problems caused starvation in his Poverty and Famines.
