answer: {William Stanley Jevons}

Echoing Spencer's First Principles, this thinker posited that the "arbitrary choice of the Creator" was the rationale for the initial distribution of atoms in the first world. He introduced the "logical alphabet" and was criticized by Robertson and Boole for that work, The Principles of Science. He responded to "sentimental writers" who charged economics with being a "dismal science" by using iron in an illustration of the division of labor. This economist analyzed fluctuations of agricultural output caused by the title phenomena in "Commercial Crises and Sunspots," though he achieved more infamy for assuming that Irish workers would be too inebriated to work. He analyzed the relationship between demand and marginal utility in his magnum opus, Theory of Political Economy. For 10 points, identify this contemporary of Léon Walras and central figure in the marginalist revolution in economic thought.

answer: {FAD} [or {FADH2}; accept {vitamin B2} or {riboflavin} until {tigloyl}]

A key step in the synthesis of this molecule forms a lumazine derivative with a sugar side chain. That synthesis begins with GTP and ribulose-5-phosphate. This molecule is a reactant in the step producing tigloyl Co-A in isoleucine degradation and is used in the first step of proline degradation. This molecule is also used in the step after thiolysis and before hydration in the cycle of beta oxidation of fatty acids. It makes up part of dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, the third enzyme in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and is also necessary for the production of fumarate in the TCA cycle. For 10 points, name this cofactor which transfers electrons directly to Complex II, bypassing the first proton pump in the electron transport chain, and which is derived from vitamin B2.

answer: {Bessel} functions

One formula used to compute these involves integrating a complex integral; that formula is also known as Sommerfeld's Formula. Bourget's hypothesis states that no two members of this class have non-trivial common roots. The Rayleigh function is a summation that uses the zeros of these objects. They form an orthogonal set of solutions to the differential equations of the same name. The Jacobi-Anger Expansion is used to represent plane waves by expanding these using trigonometric exponentials. The Hankel functions are complex linear combinations of two types of these functions, one type being the Neumann function. These entities are named for the mathematician that first calculated a star's parallax. For ten points, name these functions that may be of the second or first kind, which are useful in cylindrical harmonics and are denoted J sub nu of x.

answer: {Peasants}' {War}

One phase of this conflict saw a force of 3,500 men under the command of Hans Mueller of Bulgenbach agree to a treaty at Eratingen that called for the investigation of happenings at Stockach, which was followed by a campaign of retribution led by Georg Truchsess of Waldburg. Truchsess, after slaughtering a force of 8,000 through encirclement at Krautheim, then fought against Florian Geyer and Gregor von Burg-Bernsheim, and after dispatching them defeated another formidable force through the treachery of Walter Bach. Compared to the revolutions of 1848 in a book by Friedrich Engels, it began with the issuance of a document written by Hans Berlin and was first promulgated on Judica Sunday.  That document was the Twelve Articles, and Goetz von Berlichingen and Thomas Muntzer were important figures in this conflict. For 10 points, name this 1524-25 series of revolts in Germany.

answer: {diatoms} [prompt on {algae} or {phytoplankton} before mention]

The bodies of these organisms, when embedded in sediments, can be used to monitor the change in salinity concentration of a body of water over time. These organisms deposit new cell wall material inside their existing walls, and, as a result, gradually decrease in size after successive mitotic divisions. That shrinking is sometimes offset by the creation of auxospores, which can lie dormant to survive periods of unfavorable conditions. The bipartite walls of this organism each have an end-piece called a valve, and are joined at the cingulum. Those found in freshwater are usually the pennate type, contrasted with the centric type, and these organisms contain yellow-brown chloroplasts. For 10 points, name this group of algae whose silica-containing cell wall is called a frustule, the most abundant phytoplankton.

answer: cosmic {inflation}

A chaotic version of this process implies that bubble or pocket universes can be created anywhere, even at locations with non-peak energy levels. One early problem with this process' original formulation was that it implied bubble nucleation due to quantum tunneling, but that problem was solved by considering this process as a scalar field going down a potential. In addition to the “slow-roll” modification, this process was first posited to solve the question of why magnetic monopoles can't be found, as well as why the universe obeys the cosmological principle and why the universe is flat. While Linde modified it, it is also the most commonly accepted solution of the horizon and flatness problems. It states that the universe's anisotropies are caused by quantum fluctuations early in the universe's life, evidence of that can be found in the cosmic microwave background. For 10 points, name this process proposed by Alan Guth, which states that the universe expanded rapidly after the Big Bang.

answer: Four Books of Sentences

One part of this work argues that although wisdom could not have been created before heaven and earth according to time, it is possible that it did precede them in dignity. That same section extends Augustine's argument of simultaneous creation to include the Angels and time itself. Another part of this work says that woman was created from man's rib to show how they were meant to exist side by side, and neither as the inferior of the other, while also saying that the woman's soul is separate of that from man's despite the method of her creation. It opens by saying that all books written about the testaments are mostly about signs. Divided into a series of "distinctions" and organized furthermore into four books, it was used as the primary theological text throughout much of the later middle ages and inspired a number of commentaries. For 10 points, name this work of Peter Lombard.
