answer: The {History} of {Sexuality} [or {Histoire} de la {sexualité}]

One section of this work examines how those in ancient times shaped their lives to aesthetically match certain goals and norms, terming this the “arts of existence.” This work labels the methods that a state uses to measure and control its population in the modern age as “bio-power.” Only the first three of its planned six volumes were published, the second and third being studies of ancient Greek and Roman life respectively. Its first volume is an introduction which examines the way the Catholic ritual of confession was implemented in order to unbalance a power relationship by creating endless dialogue about the title subject. This work fervently attacks the “repressive hypothesis,” arguing in its volumes The Care of the Self, The Use of Pleasure and The Will to Knowledge that “regime of power-knowledge-pleasure” has remained in constant discourse for the last several centuries. For 10 points, name this work of Michel Foucault.

answer: {Ribozyme} [prompt on {RNA}]

One of these was found to repair lacZ transcripts in E coli, and that trans-splicing one was also used to correct mutated p53 transcripts. One of these contains loops A and B and helices H1 through H4, and is useful in the formation of a 2?,3?-cyclic phosphate. That example, originally found in the tobacco ringspot virus, is called the Hairpin one, and in that virus the same gene codes for one of these important in the replication of some viroids. Another example is found in the Hepatitis delta virus. Discoveries about the activity of these in cleaving and splicing nucleic acids led to the 1989 Nobel in Chemistry for Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech. For 10 points, name this type of nucleic acid including the Hammerhead one which can catalyze a reaction.

answer: {Progressive} Party

One of this party's candidates for Boston mayor commissioned the writing of the song “Charlie on the MTA” and was fined ten dollars for his only apparent campaign activity, which was driving around Boston in a van blasting the song from a loudspeaker. A national candidate for this party ran shortly after ending her forty-year tenure as editor of the California Eagle and was the first black woman nominated for a national elected office, Charlotta Bass. Perhaps the greatest electoral successes of a party by this name came earlier, in California, where Hiram Johnson was elected governor and then Senator on its banner. A Presidential nominee of this party wrote Where I Was Wrong to refute his earlier pro-Soviet stance and served as editor of The New Republic, while another had risen to prominence on the “Wisconsin idea.” For 10 points, name this party which, in various incarnations, nominated Henry Wallace, Robert LaFollette, and Teddy Roosevelt in his “Bull Moose” period.

answer: having the words "{love}" and "{hate}" {tattooed} on {one's knuckles} [prompt on {less specific} answers]

Among the lesser-known characters who display this body modification are the Witchsmeller Pursuivant in Black Adder and Sid Haig's Captain Spaulding in The Devil's Rejects. One character with this physical feature sings the song "Hot Patootie" while riding a motorcycle. In addition to Meat Loaf's Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, this physical feature is exhibited by a man who explains that it symbolizes when "old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low" and later claims "hot dog" and "yessirree" while simulating a fight. That scene is emulated by a character who explains the significance of this feature to pizza delivery man Mookie. Besides Radio Raheem in Do the Right Thing, this feature is seen in the remake of Cape Fear, where Robert De Niro's vengeful ex-con character displays it; that led to a Simpsons parody in which Sideshow Bob had it, and a Seinfeld episode in which Uncle Leo replaced it with the words "Jerry" and "hello." For 10 points, identify this distinctive hand adornment, first displayed by the murderous Harry Powell, played by Robert Mitchum, in Night of the Hunter.

answer: {Issac Albéniz}

This composer's song “The Caterpillar” uses lyrics from his patron Francis Money-Coutts. He included such movements as “On the Beach” and “Rumors of the Cove” in one of his suites, while another of his works was inspired by the plains around an ancient castle. In addition to Travel Memories and La Vega, he also failed to complete his piece “Mosaics” before he died due to complications with Bright's Disease. The swinging sensation in his “Sous de Palmes” is meant to coincide with a Gypsy dance, while another of this composer's pieces is meant to depict the busy port at Cádiz. Joaquim Malats's interpretation of this composer's piece Triana greatly influenced the third book of his best known work, whose opening piece includes elements of northern jotas and is entitled Evocación. That work also includes a piece inspired by the festivities of Corpus Christi in Seville. For 10 points, name this Spanish composer of the piano suite Iberia.

answer: {neuroglia} [accept {neuroglial cells}]

Tumors originating from one type of these cells are identified by perivascular rosettes, and HIV-1's Tat protein can increase expression of the JC virus genome in these cells. One subtype is marked by enlarged processes and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Members of another subtype of these cells are functionally influenced by a namesake fibrillary acidic protein, and are called gemistocytes. Other groups include those which secrete a thick protein-rich fluid, known as ependymal cells. Some of these cells direct the migration of neurons, while others tightly regulate which compounds diffuse into the brain from blood vessels. One type synthesizes growth factors following Wallerian degeneration and wraps its cell membrane multiple times around portions of adjacent cells, forming a myelin sheath. Including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells, for 10 points, are which components of neural tissue that support and nourish neurons?

answer: {Australia}

This nation saw a massacre at the Hornet Bank, and, during the Burrangong Affair, saw the ethnic Lambing Flat Riots. One rebellion in this nation featured a meeting at Bakery Hill and led to the creation of a namesake flag designed by Henry Ross that consisted of a gold cross upon a blue background; a battle during that uprising saw the forces of J.W. Thomas defeat the efforts of Peter Lalor. In another rebellion in this nation, George Johnston and John Macarthur forced a territorial governor to leave aboard the Porpoise, and they maintained control until the arrival of Lachlan Macquarie. Upon obtaining status as a confederation in 1901, its first prime minister, Edmund Barton, issued an immigration restriction act aimed mainly at stopping the influx of people from China. For 10 points, name this site of the Eureka Stockade and the Rum Rebellion.

answer: {Perpetual} Peace: A Philosophical Sketch [or {Zum ewigen Frieden}: {Ein philosophischer Entwurf}]

The footnotes to this essay convey the author's disappointment that a question by "the wise and acute" Count von Windischgrätz was never answered. It notes that with regards to conquered enemies, the chief difference between European and American savages was that the latter dined on them. Less "outdated" views presented in this essay included the distinction between a "form of sovereignty" and "form of government," which together comprise civitas and which are further developed in the two supplements and two appendices to this work. Modern debate on this work conjectures whether or not its author intended to discuss universal male suffrage as a means to its end. Containing six preliminary and three definitive articles on the title subject, this essay subtitled "A Philosophical Sketch" discusses "world citizenship" of members of "republican states" giving rise to hospitality, and thus the title concept. For 10 points, identify this work which sparked democratic peace theory, written by Immanuel Kant.

answer: malaria

TNF-alpha may contribute to the cerebral type of this disease as a result of up-regulation of ICAM-1. Deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase increases resistance to this disease, as do certain thalassemias. It causes the membranes of certain cells to become porous seconds before making them burst. Humans who are Duffy blood group negative are protected from one agent causing this disease that lacks redundancy in invasion pathways, P. vivax. Affected cells become deformed easily, leading to an outward diffusion of potassium that makes those cells less hospitable for P. falciparum in humans who are heterozygous for hemoglobin S. That heterozygosity, which also allows the spleen to preferentially destroy infected red blood cells, is sickle cell anemia. For 10 points, name this disease commonly treated with quinine which is caused by Plasmodium and transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito.

answer: the {Mahdi} [or {Muhammad Ahmad Ibn As}-{sayyid ?abd Allah}]

George Stronach and George Halkett satirized this man's greatest achievement in the “Red Book.” His followers were promised an end to forced ship-towing and floggings for unpaid taxes, and helped him annihilate the army of William Hicks. His movement benefitted from weakness caused by the immediately previous revolt of Urabi Pasha and was based out of a hermitage on Aba island. He named his followers the “helpers” or “ansar” and attempted to set up his government with four immediate deputies known as “caliphs,” though the leader of the Sanusiyah refused to participate. After he conquered al-Ubbayyid and Bara, his success prompted Garnet Wolseley to try to relieve his British opponents, but Wolseley arrived too late to prevent this man's successful conclusion of a 320-day siege. Thus, his army was able to establish a capital at Omdurman after its January 1885 victory, which killed Chinese Gordon and captured Khartoum.

In return for securing the election of his son Henry as his successor, this Holy Roman Emperor confirmed and enhanced the autonomy of the German princes of the Holy Roman Empire through his Confederation with the Ecclesiastical Princes. In contrast, in his capacity as King of Sicily, this ruler established a strong centralized government thorough his Constitutions of Melfi and converted his court at Palermo into a major cultural center that attracted Greek and Muslim scholars. This husband of Yolande of Jerusalem bought Jerusalem from the Ayyubids before going on the Fifth and Sixth Crusades. However, he was also excommunicated four times during his lifetime and was the only medieval emperor consigned to hell in Dante's Divine Comedy.
