answer: {piezoelectricity} [accept {piezoelectric effect}]

The elliptical cavity problem along with other similar cavity problems are important in the study of this effect and in two-dimensions, the Lekhnitskii and Stroh formalism can both be used to describe it. In the linear approximation of this effect, there are 18 independent namesake constants to solve for. That approximation couples the equation setting the electric displacement field equal to the permittivity of free space times the electric field plus polarization with Hooke's law. Although not pyroelectricity, ferroelectric materials exhibit this effect. This effect's converse is electrostriction and it only occurs in materials without a center of symmetry. Used in cigarette lighters and sonar, for 10 points, name this effect is found in materials like quartz that causes an electric field or potential to be generated in response to mechanical strain.

answer: {Achaean} League

The second version of this polity lost at Caphyae because they sent their thureos wielding troops to follow an enemy up a mountainside. The first version of this polity was dissolved by Antigonus II Gonatus. This polity had unpaid magistrates, who were elected by a general assembly. Ptolemy III Euergetes stopped sending aid to the second version of this polity after the citizens of Megalopolis pressured it to ask Antiochus III Doson for help. That decision by Aratus of Sicyon led to the fall of the reformed Sparta under Cleomenes III. This polity was neutral as the Romans conquered Macedonia, but later, 1,000 members from this polity were forced to be hostages to Rome, including Polybius. Although not just one city, the final end of this polity came at the hands of Lucius Mummius who sacked Corinth.

answer: {Cushing's syndrome} [accept {Cushing's disease}]

The cause of this disorder may be assessed through blood samples from the petrosal sinuses or a CRH stimulation test, and it is commonly diagnosed by a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The ectopic form of this disease may be caused by excess hormone secretion from small cell lung cancer. Iatrogenic causes include excess administration of drugs like medroxyprogesterone and methyl-prednisolone. Symptoms of this disease include acanthosis, or darkening of the skin, around the neck; stretch marks across the abdomen and thighs; and hirsutism. Also common are its characteristic "moon face" and the presence of a fat pad on the upper back, called a buffalo hump, resulting from the redistribution of body fat. It is most commonly caused by pituitary adenomas which secrete extra ACTH, leading to overstimulation of the adrenal glands. For 10 points, identify this disease characterized by excess production of the stress hormone, cortisol.

answer: A {Letter Concerning Toleration}

One section of this work argues that there is no difference between killing a calf in private and killing a calf in public to demonstrate the universality of laws arising from the author's conception of the “commonwealth”. This work's conclusion differentiates between the respective doctrinal and practical natures of heresy and schism, and the author's recurring argument that the care of souls and salvation cannot belong to a civil magistrate gives rise to the title concept, which excludes those the author determines are not bound by social promises, such as atheists.

answer: {John Von Neumann}

This man developed a version of quantum mechanics based on separable Hilbert spaces, found a proof showing that matrix and wave mechanics are equivalent without the use of delta functions, and published a book entitled Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. With Neddermeyer and Teller, he was a key designer of the implosion technique used in the first atomic bombs. This man found a simple method, using pairs of coin flips with different results, to generate randomness using a biased coin. He invented a sorting algorithm which splits a list into two halves, sorts each half, and merges the two sublists back together. For 10 points, name this mathematician and computer scientist who invented the merge sort and whose design of allocating the same memory to instructions and data is known as his namesake computer architecture.

While not Nova Scotia, one ruler from this nation founded Louisbourg and introduced a Latin script.

More famously, that ruler of this nation instigated a mass persecution of Christians to let tribal religions survive that still prevail today in coastal cities like Toamasina. In addition to Queen Ranavalona I, later rulers allowed the British to trade again, sparking the Franco-Hova wars. Later, this nation was ruled by the Free French after Operation Ironclad, but earlier Hitler proposed this nation as a place to send all European Jews.

answer: The {Musical Offering} [or {Das Musikalische Opfer}]

One piece in this collection has the phrase “sopr'il Soggetto Reale”, or “above the real subject,” included in its title and is notable for its difficult orchestration for the flute. In addition to that trio sonata, this collection also contains a piece for six voices that was later orchestrated by Anton Webern and a piece in which the second instrument plays the theme backwards, known as a “crab” canon. Inscriptions above some of the pieces allude to “increasing fortunes” and “ascending glory” in unison with the music, and two of the pieces do not contain time signatures, leaving them ambiguous as to how they should be performed. During a trip to Potsdam in 1747, its composer was challenged by this collection's dedicatee to create two fugues on a “royal theme”; those fugues became the two ricercars that open this collection, which also includes ten “riddle” or “puzzle” canons. For 10 points, name this collection of music dedicated to Frederick the Great, a work by J.S. Bach.

answer: {histidine} [prompt on His]

In a recent study, a mutation in the gene encoding for the decarboxylase of this molecule has been linked to the modulation of Tourette's Syndrome. In Neurospora crassa, this molecule can be converted into ergothioneine. In carbonic anhydrase, its side chain can be used to shuttle protons away from a water molecule to activate the enzyme again. In the zinc finger motif, two cysteine residues and two examples of this amino acid are used to trap the zinc ion. This amino acid's function in catalytic triads is to abstract a proton from serine, threonine, or cysteine, activating any of those amino acids as a nucleophile. It is both aromatic and basic because of its imidazole side chain. For 10 points, name this amino acid that can be decarboxylated to form histamine.

Later parts of this book consider why it is that criminal law is always less exact than civil law; its author discusses the sentimentality inherent in judgment and relates this to the pseudo-sciences of ethics and theology.

The forces of their opponents initially consisted of a small squadron under the command of George Pickett, though he was later reinforced and replaced by Silas Casey.
