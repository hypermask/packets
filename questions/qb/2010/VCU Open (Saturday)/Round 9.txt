answer: {cytokines}

A 1992 paper by Dantzer and Kelley reported sickness-related behavior in mice that had these chemicals administered directly to the brain. The transforming growth factor beta superfamily belongs to the group of cysteine-knot variety of these chemicals. Their receptors are linked to JAK kinases, which activate STAT transcription factors. The drug TGN1412 caused a fatal positive feedback loop involving them; an earlier instance of the same killed many in the 1918 flu pandemic. Two classes of these molecules that can produce a namesake "storm" are secreted by leukocytes and virally infected cells and are termed interleukins and interferons, respectively. They are associated with clonal selection and activation of lymphocytes. For 10 points, name this diverse class of signaling molecules used by immune cells.

answer: The {Birth} of {Tragedy} out of the Spirit of Music [or Die {Geburt} der {Tragödie} aus dem Geiste der Musi]

This book contrasts the radiating, hovering, Jesus with the suffering disciples below in Raphael's Transfiguration as an example of “transforming an illusion into an illusion.” It tells the story of King Midas, who chased a satyr for many years only to be greeted by derision after asking it the meaning of life. This work defines the “naïve artist” as one who is interested only in the beauty of a work. Fourteen years after its publication, the author of this work prefaced its twenty five chapters with “An Attempt at Self-Criticism.” This work also contains a “Preface to Richard Wagner,” as it holds that the emerging German art is the last bastion of true culture. It holds that the elimination of music was one of the many crimes committed by Euripides, whose intellectualism disturbed the balance between the Apollonian and Dionysian.

One offshoot of this denomination known as “The Dawn” evangelized through a radio question and answer program called Frank and Ernest. This sect rented eighty movie theaters in 1914 to play an eight hour long Photo-Drama of Creation all around the United States. Many of the modern ideas of this denomination, including the belief that Jesus was killed on a stake instead of a cross, were shaped by “Judge” Rutherford. This faith has its origins in the Adventist beliefs of Charles Taze Russell, whose work led to predictions of the end of “the time of the gentiles” in 1914, 1925, and 1975, and claimed that 144,000 people would be lifted up to heaven. This religion prohibits saluting a flag or receiving or giving blood transfusion and spreads its beliefs through publications like Awake! and The Watchtower.

answer: War of Spanish {Succession}

One phase of this war was a revolt by a group sometimes called “Cadets of the Cross” against the policy of Dragonnade, and was sparked by the assassination of François Langlade before being quenched with the Pacification of the Camisards.

One side was commanded by generals like Duc de Villars, who lost the battles of Bouchain and Malpaquet to the Duke of Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy. This war was sparked when Louis XIV's grandson was named heir to Charles II. For 10 points, name this war ended by the Treaty of Utrecht fought over control of an Iberian throne.

answer: CP Violation

In 2001, this phenomenon was observed in the decay of particles containing a bottom quark and either an up, down, charm, or strange quark. This phenomenon is seen as the non-conservation of time reversal. One possible solution of the strong form of this is the Peccei-Quinn theory, which posits the existence of axions. Along with lack of thermal equilibrium and baryon number violation, this is one of the three Sakharov conditions. While it was found in B-mesons, this phenomenon was first discovered by Cronin and Fitch in neutral kaon and it helps explain why the universe is composed mostly of matter. For 10 points, name this phenomenon that says that the laws of physics are not the same if the namesake properties are swapped.

answer: {Cycloid}

A propeller designed around this shape rotates around the vertical axis and provides extremely fast changes in thrust direction. That propeller is named after Voith and Schneider. Its catacaustic divides it in two, and it is equal to its evolute. Depending on how one is created, it can be curtate or prolate. When a pendulum is forced to follow a path of this shape, it will reach the lowest point of its swing in the same amount of time no matter where it is initially placed, and it is the path a bead on a wire would take to fall from one point to another at the fastest speed. For 10 points name this curve which solves the tautochrone and brachistochrone problems and is the shape a point on the edge of a rolling circle traces out.

This work notes that people are being willfully controlled by large social structures and worries they will become “cheerful robots.” An appendix published with this book includes excerpts of its author's detailed notes on Gaetano Mosca as an example for students and is titled “On Intellectual Craftsmanship.” This work attacks the relentless pursuit of data on minutiae exemplified by Paul Lazarsfield's work, which its author compares to market research and terms “abstracted empiricism.” The first attack in this work is against the elaborate ungrounded systems propounded especially by Talcott Parsons which are deemed “Grand Theory.” Instead, beginning in its opening chapter “The Promise,” this work advocates a problem oriented approach which focuses on connecting the travails of individual people to greater social movements. For 10 points, name this work by C. Wright Mills.

One of this artist's earlier works features several yellow vertical bars and a magenta horizontal bar, which was later shaded black, then back to magenta over the course of thirty years. That work, Little Spanish Prison, was created during a trip to Mexico, which also resulted in the appropriately-titled Mexican Sketchbook. His collage Surprise and Inspiration was at the center of his first one-man exhibition, and in 1991 he died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he had flung paint on canvases to create many of his Beside the Sea paintings. His work with color-field theory led to his Open series, but this artist is better remembered for his painting At Five in the Afternoon, which is reminiscent of another series comprised of paintings of black circles between black vertical bars on a white canvas. Once the husband of Helen Frankenthaler, this is, for 10 points, what American Abstract Expressionist best known for his series Elegy for the Spanish Republic?

answer: {ester} [accept {iminoester} or {Pinner reaction} in the first sentence]

An aluminum alkoxide coordinates with one of two equivalents of aldehydes to produce this functional group in one reaction. Potassium carbonate work-up of the product of a reaction of gaseous hydrochloric acid in alcohol and anhydrous chloride with a nitrile yields an imino- analogue of them. Another usage of a Lewis acid catalyst involves the phenyl version of this functional group producing a hydroxyl aryl ketone. The tert-butyl variety of this functional group that is produced in the Tischenko and Pinner reactions is attached to amino acids as a protecting group. The cyclic version of this functional group can be produced when a peroxy acid like mCPBA reacts with a cyclic ketone in the Baeyer Villager reaction. Deprotonation of the alpha hydrogens in a beta-keto- one occurs in the Claisen condensation. This functional group breaks up into two components in saponification. Formed when a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the Fischer synthesis, for 10 points, name this functional group in which a carbonyl carbon is connected to another oxygen.

answer: United States Presidential election of {1888}

This election played a key role in the switch to a secret ballot, after Indiana's Republican Party openly paid voters to cast pre-printed votes in the “blocks of five” scandal. Other major issues in this election included the admission of the Dakota Territory as one or more states, which Democrats in Congress were blocking due to an expected Republican stronghold there. One candidate in this election was formerly the Nashville commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau who was inspired by his Civil War experiences to found a black college; that was Prohibition candidate Clinton Fisk. Irish-American votes in this election were swayed after California Congressman George Osgoodby forged a missive to Ambassador Lionel Sackville-West, pretending to be from a British-born American citizen named Charles Murchison. Also the second election in which the Equal Rights Party nominated Belva Lockwood, this contest ended with the winner of the popular vote in second place electorally.
