Frequently supported by Sudan, and led by Joseph Kony, this group opposes current president Yoweri Museveni and seeks to establish a new government based on the Ten Commandments. For 10 points, name this group which operates bases in eastern DR Congo and northern Uganda and is accused of a series of war crimes stemming from its twenty-year insurrection.

answer: {Giselle}

The creation of this ballet so inspired the Paris Opera that rehearsals on La Jolie Fille de Gand were stopped so that it could be immediately performed. It was inspired by a reading of Heinrich Heine's De l'Allemagne and by one librettist's infatuation with Carlotta Grisi, who starred in its first performance. In this ballet, Berthe fears the spirits led by Queen Myrta, who force men to dance to death during the hours between midnight and dawn, and indeed, the exposure of one character's disguise by the jealous gamekeeper Hilarion leads Berthe's daughter to join those Wilis. A prince engaged to Bathilde disguises himself as Loys but is revealed as Albrecht, causing the death of the title peasant girl, in this ballet, which Marius Petipa revised after the original libretto by the Marquis de Saint-Georges and Theophile Gautier. For 10 points, identify this ballet with music by Adolphe Adam.

answer: First {Corinthians}

This book's sixth chapter warns that “your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost” and that “ye are not your own.” The first chapter of this book dismisses Jews who “require a sign” and Greeks who “seek after wisdom” and identifies its co-author as “Sosthenes our brother.” This book's eleventh chapter is the basis for the oft-ignored rule that women must cover their heads while praying or proselytizing. Its passage “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?” is often read at Easter, as this book contains the fullest enunciation of the doctrine of the “Resurrection of the Dead.” This book declares that “when I became a man, I put away childish things” before noting that “we see through a glass, darkly.” The thirteenth chapter of this book also ends a digression on the nature of love by stating that there is “faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.” For 10 points, name this Pauline epistle addressed to a Greek city.

answer: {Meissner}-Oschenfeld effect

The paramagnetic variant of this effect can be seen in BSCCO if it is under a weak magnetic field. In addition to the Wohlleben effect, this effect was first described in a set of equations relating the time derivative of the current to electric field and the curl of the current to magnetic field.  Applying Ampere's law to those equations yields another equation which relates the Laplacian of the magnetic field to the magnetic field multiplied by the reciprocal of a characteristic length, lambda.  In addition to being described by the London equations, this effect makes materials have a magnetic susceptibility of negative 1, making them perfectly diamagnetic. It can be observed by a magnet floating above a superconductor. For 10 points, name this effect where a superconductor expels all external magnetic fields.

This city is home to the Delavan Hotel, where Katrina Taylor is injured in a fire after falling in love with the Irish reporter Edward Daugherty in a work which opens by discussing the “Love Nest” murder-suicide of 1808. A history of this city is subtitled an “Improbable City of Political Wizards, Fearless Ethnics, Spectacular Aristocrats, Splendid Nobodies, and Underrated Scoundrels.” One resident of this city is haunted by an incident in which he accidentally dropped and killed his son Gerald, and that character's son bowls a 299 at the beginning of one novel. Novels set in this city depict the deep influence of Patsy McCall's political machine and lawyer Marcus Gorman being drawn into the circle of the gangster Jack Diamond. Those novels portray members of the Phelan family and include Legs and Ironweed. For 10 points, name this New York setting of a William Kennedy cycle.

Via the Treaty of Perpetual Peace, this ruler's daughter became James IV's wife. He signed the favorable Magnus Intercursus, though later he forced Philip I of Castile to sign Malus Intercursus to this ruler's benefit. Like his predecessor, this husband of the eldest daughter of Elizabeth Woodville was bought off for 50,000 crown per year in the Treaty of Etaples. This man signed the Treaty of Medina Del Campo to marry his sons, but failed to complete many of the terms in that agreement. This paternal grandson of Catherine of Valois won at Stoke Field against the pretender Lambert Simnel, and later he defeated Perkin Warbeck. Creating the Star Chamber, this man's daughter-in-laws included Catherine of Aragon. For 10 points, name this victor at Bosworth Field and founder of the Tudor dynasty.

answer: {bacteriophages}

One of these organisms was used in a study that looked at the transport of pathogens, indicator bacteria, and other particles from top-soil to the supply of drinking water. Seymour Benzer used various strains of one of these organisms to develop his "r-two system," and another type of them was the first organism to have its entire nucleotide sequence determined.  Both phosphorus-32 and sulfur-35 were used to label different parts of these organisms in a 1952 experiment that confirmed DNA as the genetic material, conducted by Hershey and Chase.  The T4 type of these organisms can be used as a biosorbent coupled with a bioluminescent ATP assay to detect and approximate the amount of E. coli. The most common type is the lambda, which reproduces via lysogeny. For 10 points, name these intracellular parasites which can reproduce via the lytic cycle, thus bursting their host bacteria.

answer: {Gorgias}

In this work, Socrates notes that a ruler whose policies have immediate benefit but harm future generations is no better than a charioteer who only succeeds at his first race. Socrates earlier escapes charges that practicing philosophy is disgraceful for adults by claiming he shares the three necessary qualities of knowledge, good-will, and outspokenness with his accuser Callicles. The characters in this work agree that doing wrong and escaping punishment is the worst offense and that tyrants actually have little power because they do what they must. Socrates spends much of this debate arguing with the student Polus, and argues against living with unrestrained desires by using the metaphor of the leaky jar. Socrates also tells of a myth in which Zeus orders that souls be judged without their clothes, and labels its title character's profession as mere flattery. For 10 points, name this Plato work titled after a Sophist.

answer: {nine}-{point} circle

The Jerabek antipode lies on this entity, as does the Kiepert antipode; both of the aforementioned antipodes also lend names to centers of namesake rectangular hyperbolae which also pass through special parts of this figure. The conical version of this entity deals with the midpoints and intersection points of the diagonals of a complete quadrangle. In a quadrilateral, these entities form a set named after Johnson. The trilinear coordinates for a characteristic of this entity are given as a triple ratio of the cosine of the pairwise differences of the angles. Feuerbach's Theorem states that this entity is tangent to four other similar figures, with three of those being excircles. The center of this figure is the midpoint of the orthocenter and the circumcenter of a triangle. For ten points, name this entity which passes through the midpoints of the segments formed by the orthocenter and the vertices, the feet of the altitudes and the midpoints of the sides, a famous circle in geometry.

answer: {Gibbs}-{Duhem} Equation

One analogue of this equation can be derived by adding a term for surface tension to the additivity rule for bulk phases and then differentiating. When applied to a solution, this equation yields a relationship between the natural logarithms of the activities of the solvent and solute. The general form of this equation sets the central sum over all components of a system equal to negative differential temperature times entropy plus differential pressure times volume. For systems of constant temperature and pressure, it relates changes in chemical potential with changes in composition. For 10 points, name this doubly-eponymous equation which is used to derive one of its namesake's phase rule.
