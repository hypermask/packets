answer: {wnt} signaling pathway

It has been found that administration of gamma-interferon in vitro is linked to the oncogenesis of pancreatic cells through this pathway, which may play a role in the renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. Steps in this pathway include the activation of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors, using a “destruction complex” that includes the proteins APC and axin. The membrane portion of this pathway is stabilized by LRP, and that portion contains a trimeric G protein connecting the dishevelled and frizzled proteins. This pathway's effects hinge on its ability to control cytosolic levels of beta-catenin. Working in tandem with sonic hedgehog homolog to define an organism's dorsal-ventral axis is, for 10 points, this cellular signaling pathway, whose name is a portmanteau of a Drosophila gene and a mouse gene.

answer: Against {Method}

One section of this work cites the irregular motion of the planets in the time of Plato in arguing against a distinction between the “context of discovery” and the “context of justification.” Its author vehemently attacked criticism of this book in a section of his next work entitled “Conversations with Illiterates.” It highlights the rationality of the “tower argument” and of the views of the Catholic Church in arguing that Galileo managed to advance Copernican ideas more through political notions and psychological tricks than through rationality. This work engages in a reductio ad absurdum argument which culminates in the principle “anything goes,” and it was originally intended to be half of a debate with Imre Lakatos. It was followed up by its author's Science in a Free Society, and advocates his position of “epistemological anarchism” in arguing that prescriptivist rules hamper the free flow of theories and ideas that makes science work. For 10 points, name this magnum opus of Paul Feyerabend.

answer: {George Gurdijeff}

In his book Life Is Real Only Then, When "I Am", this man detailed an oath his followers signed to distance themselves from A. R. Orage, and which Orage himself signed. He detailed his encounters with Father Giovanni and Prince Lubovedsky in one autobiographical work, and another of his works consists of conversations between Hassein and his grandfather as they travel towards Karatas on the spaceship Karnak. This author of Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson and Meetings with Remarkable Men claimed to used his time at the Sarmoung Monastery to develop the symbol of the enneagram as well as a thirty-nine part set of dances known as his “movements.” He taught a cosmology centered on the “Ray of Creation,” and his beliefs were described by his disciple P. D. Ouspensky as “the Fourth Way.” For 10 points, name this man whose teachings influenced Jean Toomer and Katherine Mansfield, an Armenian mystic.

answer: {Cesar Franck}

The premiere of one of this man's compositions occurred in a darkened art gallery, forcing Eugene Ysaye to play it from memory. That “Sonata for Violin and Piano in A major” was written for Ysaye's wedding and is an example of this composer's preoccupation with the “cyclic form” which he adopted from Liszt. His “Mass for Three Voices” contains a strophe pulled from Aquinas's Sacris solemniis that is often performed alone, his Panis angelicus. He wrote a symphonic poem about a noble who is cursed after blowing his hunting chord during the Sabbath. His reputation was established posthumously by his students Ernest Chausson, Henri Duparc, and Vincent d'Indy, who ensured his Le Chasseur maudit and Symphonic Variations would become part of the standard repertoire. For 10 points, name this French-Belgian composer and organist best remembered for his Symphony in D minor.

answer: Sir {Percival} [or {Parzival}]

In one legend, this knight saves a lion by killing a serpent it is fighting. He stabs himself in the thigh for penance after the image of the red cross on his sword barely prevents him from losing his virginity to a temptress. In another story, his sister Dindrane gives him the Sword of the Strange Belt and gives her life to save a leper. This character eventually marries Blanchefleur, and embarrasses himself with his ignorance after being raised in seclusion by his mother. This character is mentored by Sir Gornemont, who warns him against impolitely asking questions. That injunction backfires when this knight fails to heal the wounded Fisher King by not asking about a mysterious procession at Corbenic Castle. In another legend this knight joins Galahad and Bors as the only knights who see the grail. For 10 points, name this knight whose story was told in a Wolfram von Eschenbach epic and a Wagner opera.

answer: {Roger David Casement}

This man referenced the irrelevance of the "civilization of the twentieth century" in his conviction under the 1351 Treason Act that equated heretics with traitors. He had the Libau outfitted as a Norwegian merchant ship under the command of Captain Karl Spindler, whose interception made him go ashore to McKenna's Fort, where he was captured. This man heard of Walter Hardenburg's exposé of Julio Cesar Arana's system for sernambi gathering, inspiring him to spend time with the Putumayo Indians in Peru. Scholarship holds that the "Black Diaries" describing the homosexual relations of his man were forgeries. He was executed after trying to involve Germany in the Irish Home Rule movement years after his work for the British Foreign Office. For 10 points, identify this Irish martyr who had highlighted the exploitation of rubber workers in King Leopold's Congo Free State.

answer: Frank Lloyd {Wright}

He included a call for lush vegetation under the hexagonal glass latticed roof in the design of his unrealized Arizona state capitol building titled “Oasis.” Another of his Arizona designs is often compared to his plan for a Baghdad Opera House and is Arizona State's Gammage Auditorium. One of the houses he designed includes a daughter's bedroom jutting from the second story with no visible supports, as well as a glass “crow's nest” where Herbert Johnson's children could watch him fly by in his airplane. This architect who used four zones to divide his Wingspread House was commissioned by Elbert Hubbard and a soap magnate to construct a Buffalo building. He supported the roof of the “Great Workroom” with stalactite like columns in the Johnson Wax Building, and received numerous complaints from modern painters because of the curved walls of his Guggenheim Museum. For 10 points, name this American Prairie Style architect of Falling Water.

answer: {magnetic vector potential} [prompt on partial answers; accept {electric potential} before finishing saying momentum three vector]

The Schrodinger-Pauli equation sees this quantity multiplied by charge and subtracted from the momentum three vector. An electron's interference pattern changes when a solenoid turns on despite the fact that the magnetic field outside of the solenoid is zero because of this quantity. For a non-conservative electric field, the electric field is equal to the negative gradient of the electric potential minus the time derivative of this quantity. In addition to causing the Aharonov-Bohm effect, this quantity is combined with the electric potential to form the 4-potential. This quantity's divergence is set to zero in the Coulomb gauge. For 10 points, magnetic field is defined as the curl of this quantity that is symbolized A.

answer: {Carmichael} numbers or {absolute Fermat pseudoprimes} [prompt on {pseudoprimes}]

Huthnance and Warndof showed that if one of these is used as the modulus of an RSA encryption scheme, the cryptosystem still works as intended, but is more vulnerable to attacks. Any solution to Lehmer's Totient Problem is one of these numbers, which satisfy Korselt's criterion. In order for a number n to be one, it must be able divide the denominator of n minus oneth Bernoulli number. Richard Pinch is known for finding their distribution up to 10 to the 20th power, and in 1994 a team led by Alfred showed that there are infinitely many of them. Besides being squarefree and having at least three prime factors, these numbers also satisfy the congruence a to the n congruent to a modulus n, where n is one of these and a is any integer; thus, these numbers are an exception to a primality test named after a French mathematician. For 10 points, name this group of integers that satisfy Fermat's Little Theorem despite being composite.

answer: {Pierre Bourdieu}

This man theorized that “misrecognition” can cause people to not realize that socially powerful agents are employing “soft” or “symbolic violence.” He suggested that this “violence” is enacted by those who have received prestige or “symbolic capital” from entrenched societal institutions. He adapted Mauss's concept of “body technique” to describe the set of dispositions accumulated through upbringing and education. He eschewed Marx's classes to coin a term for social arenas in which agents compete for economic and cultural resources. This developer of “habitus” and “field” concepts used the Kabyle culture to illustrate methods of social anthropology in his Outline of a Theory of Practice. His most well-known book uses the French population of the 1960s to examine the way social power and prestige affects taste. For 10 points, name this French sociologist and author of Distinction.

The action of one painting by this man is overlaid by a large orange vertical stripe and a blue horizontal stripe which is punctuated by a large red “C” which stands for cirque. This was representative of a shift in style late in his career in which he drew forms in black and white and added color, mainly red, blue, and yellow, in wide swaths. This artist created the two murals in the General Assembly Hall of the UN headquarters. He depicted the title figures resting on a yellow couch next to a small red table in his Three Women. He painted recurring subjects like “constructors,” “country outings,” “cyclists,” and “keys” in groups called “cycles.” His attempt to depict humans and other figures with three-dimensional robotic cylinders led Louis Vauxcelles to dub his work Tubism.

answer: {silicon}

Like the element immediately below it on the periodic table, when this element is surrounded by only hydrogen atoms, the resulting molecule acts as a high temperature superconducting solid at high pressures. It is commonly purified by reacting it with HCl to produce its trichloro form, and decomposing that molecule to deposit this element on heated rods, a process which can reduce impurities to less than 1 part per billion. That process is named after Siemens. One material with an extremely low glass transition temperature of below -125 degrees Celsius contains methyl side chains and a backbone made of oxygen alternating with this element. That polymer is widely used in shampoos and is cross-linked with boric acid to form silly putty.
