answer: the {Redcrosse Knight}

?The future wife of this character witnesses the killing of a robber who delivers spoils to Corceca and Abessa. The children of one of his enemies drink their mother's blood and explode after this hero frees himself from that mother's tail's vicegrip and strangles her. This character tears a branch off a tree, causing it to bleed and reveal that it is actually Fradubio, having been changed into that form by an ugly woman. This character is served by a loyal dwarf who warns him to steer clear of Error's Cave and relates to this character's love that his likeness was assumed by Archimago. In his final appearance, this character exposes the lies of a messenger who claims that he had pledged to marry Duessa, and thus could not marry Una. For 10 points, identify this personification of St. George who sports a certain emblazonment on his armor and is the protagonist of the first book of Spenser's The Faerie Queene.

answer: {bubonic plague}

The bacteria responsible for this disease produces a factor called YopJ which interferes with the phosphorylation of MAPK kinases, and its YopO protein induces apoptosis in human macrophages, allowing it to resist phagocytosis. Other virulence factors produced in this disease include fibrinolytic enzymes, coagulase, and a respiratory inhibiting murine exotoxin. In Xenopsylla cheopis, this disease leads to the formation of biofilms, blocking off the gut. This causes the vector to bite additional hosts out of hunger, and to regurgitate the contents of its gut at sites where the insect bites. Its primary pneumonic form has nearly a 100% mortality rate. This disease spreads to humans when its sylvatic form causes a mass die-off of rats, and its best known form is characterized by necrosis and gangrene at the extremities. For 10 points, name this disease caused by Yersinia pestis, most notably characterized by the formation of lymph node buboes.

answer: The {Essence} of {Christianity}

This work argues that, since "that which man excludes from heaven he excludes from his true nature" and "in heaven there is no marriage," celibacy is inherent to the nature of faith. The same section in which that argument appears, "Celibacy and Monachism," also discusses how "The idea of man as a species, and with it the significance of the life of the species, of humanity as a whole, vanished." Its second chapter, which discusses "God as a Being of the Understanding," proclaims that "Religion is the disuniting of man from himself" and elaborates on how man and God are opposites. Its second section contains chapters on contradictions in the existence, revelation, and nature of God. Forming the basis for many of Karl Marx's views on religion, for 10 points, name this work of Ludwig Feuerbach that outlined his opinion of a certain faith founded by Jesus.

answer: {Shabbat} [or {Sabbath}]

A song sung at the beginning of this observance refers to it as a queen or bride and is called the Lekhah Dodi. Common meals eaten on this day include a stew called Cholent which is often eaten as the Seudah Shlishit or “third meal.” It ends with a breaking ceremony called Havdalah which occurs after three stars are visible in the night sky. The scriptural justification for this observance comes from Exodus 20:11 and Deuteronomy 5:15, which provide its two commandments of Zakhor and Shamor, or “to remember” and “to observe.” Rabbinical debate over the meaning of Melachah primarily applies to this day, as it suggests avoiding the thirty-nine melakhot, which include writing two or more letters, tearing for the purpose of sewing, and igniting a fire. This observance begins on Fridays at sundown and concludes at sundown on Saturdays. For 10 points, name this Jewish day of rest.

answer: Carl {Neilsen}

This composer's sixth symphony has one section that features only winds and percussion and opens with a bell followed by a melody in the strings in G major. His third symphony is his only symphony to use vocals and has wordless solos for baritone and soprano in the second movement. His second symphony, supposedly inspired by a painting he saw at a pub, has movements in B minor, G major, E flat minor, and D major, invoking images of different types of people. This composer of symphonies labeled Semplice and Espansiva is best known for a symphony that has four continuous movements and calls for two timpanis, which counter each other in a sort of musical joust. For 10 points, name this composer of The Four Temperaments and Inextinguishable symphonies who hails from Denmark.

answer: House of {Vasa} [accept {Waza}; accept {Vasaätten}]

The founder of this house made it so that for every ten men, one man had to serve in the military to create a standing army, which was later expanded into an allotment system. That founder's forces won at the Battle of Buchow and signed the Treaty of Stettin to end the Northern Seven Year's War, but later went insane. Another ruler from this house defeated his usurping uncle at the Battle of Stegeborg, but refrained from destroying the army in mercy. One member of this line fought his cousin at Klushino to promote his own candidate for the Russian throne. One was a Polish King who supported his son Wladyslaw IV, while a more famous member signed the Treaty of Stolbovo with Michael Romanov. That more famous member of this house went on to fight Count Tilly at the Battle of the Rain and Breitenfield before dying at Lutzen. For 10 points, name this house including Sigismund III and Gustavus Adolphus.

answer: {visiting} the {underworld} [or {katabasis}; or {visiting Hades}; accept {logical} equivalents]

The eighth book of the Thebaid opens by describing Tisiphone being sent into battle after this action is completed by a seer who was tricked into fighting when his wife Eriphyle was bribed with the Necklace of Harmonia. That man is Amphiaraus, who does this after Zeus saves him from Poriclymenus. In one story, Psyche is told how to do this by a tower and falls into a deep sleep while doing it after Aphrodite demands that she fill a box with beauty. One way of doing this is to dig a hole at the confluence of three rivers, pour honey, milk, wine, and water into it, and cut the throats of a ram and a ewe. Odysseus violates Circe's instructions by speaking to Elpenor while completing this action and the Sibyl of Cumae tells Aeneas he'll need the Golden Bough to do it. Heracles encounters an entrapped Theseus while doing it during his 12th labor, and Orpheus does this by charming Charon. For 10 points, name this action which sometimes involves defeating Cerberus and encountering Persephone.

answer: {Catalonia} [accept {Cataluña}; accept {Catalunya}; accept {Catalonha}]

One revolt in this region began in 1640 with Pau Claris signing the Covenant Ceret and saw early success at the Battle of Monjuic. Another revolt in this region was the result of the remences combined with the Biga and saw foreign intervention from Rene the Good of Anjou and Louis XI. That one targeted John II. The 1640 attempt at establishing a republic here ended in 1659 with the Peace of Pyrenees. That one saw the loss of the Rousillon and Cerdagne, which were northern portions of this region. In addition to being the location of the Reaper's war, Francesc Macià began another attempt to start a republic here in 1931. That attempt settled for partial autonomy for this county, which it still maintains along with Gallicia and Basque. For 10 points, name this county centered at Barcelona.

answer: {Prohibition} [or {temperance}]

This cause led to Westerville, Ohio becoming a postal mecca after one of its leading journals established a printing plant there. Pledges to support its cause were signed by children to join the Lincoln-Lee Legion. Other advocates for this cause used the slogans “Prevention is better than cure,” “John Barleycorn must die,” and “For God and home and native land;” the latter was put forth by an organization led by Frances Willard and named for Christian women. When this cause achieved its goals, “blind pigs” arose, and men such as Eliot Ness attempted to enforce laws against “speakeasies.” For 10 points, identify this cause which was enacted by the Volstead Act and the Eighteenth Amendment and kept America dry from 1918 to 1933.

answer: {César Pelli}

This architect used cornices, escutcheons, and window architraves made of copper to add a facade to the Sibour-designed Investment Building in Washington D.C. He used a bright orange deformed triangular arc as the lobby for the thin metal-skinned NTT Shinjuku Head Office Building in Tokyo, which was inspired by his breakout project, the Herring Hall at Rice University. Both buildings show his desire to evolve beyond load-bearing walls to maintain a sense of enclosure, a point he made in his book “Observations for Young Architects.” That book also discusses many of his early works such as one nicknamed “The Blue Whale,” the Pacific Design Center. Other buildings designed by him include and the similar-looking Bank of America and Wells Fargo Centers in Charlotte and Minneapolis, respectively. Another of his buildings is located above the KLCC Park, possesses a complex series of lifts, and was built with the help of Djay Cerico. For 10 points, identify this architect who incorporated a skybridge between his Kuala Lumpur-located Petronas Towers.

Numerous minuature house-graves with windows are a feature of the Prazeres Cemetery in this city, located near the Estrela Basilica. Just north of this city lies a natural defensive region later fortified into the Lines of Torres Verdas. The unfinished neoclassical Ajuda Palace and the Jerominos Monastary are examples of Manuelite Architecture in this city, whose Pombaline Baixa was notably resistant. The ornate Belem Tower sits close to the Monument to the Discoveries in this city, which is located downstream from the Golden-Gate-inspired 25th of April Bridge. For 10 points, identify this city where the Tagus River is crossed by the Vasco da Gama bridge.

answer: {fine}-{structure} constant [prompt on {alpha}]

In 2008, observations from the Very Large Telescope found that this quantity may have varied around 4 parts per million, though earlier, the Keck telescopes found it has changed by 6 parts per million. The first order anomalous magnetic dipole moment is approximately equal to this constant divided by two pi. This constant is squared in the Klein-Nishina formula, while the Lamb Shift depends on its fifth power. In cgs units, this constant is equal to the reciprocal of the quantity of the von Klitzing constant times the speed of light, making it easy to measure this with the Quantum Hall Effect. Corrections to the ratio of the spin and orbital angular momenta for an electron, or the Lande g-factor, use power series of this constant. It is the coupling constant for electromagnetic interactions. For 10 points, name this constant denoted alpha, which was mistakenly thought be exactly 1 over 137.

answer: the {Orangedrink Lemondrink} Man

This person is first encountered while sitting on an "electric blue foamleather car-sofa" because a "little man with the tickets" can't resist singing along to "an Elvis Pelvis nun" in The Sound of Music. He threatens to "file a written complaint" against another character for interrupting his "Resting Time" and "singing English songs," shortly before making a joke about a "sleeping partner" at Paradise Pickles. His actions at the Abhilash Talkies are blocked out by listing all the produce offered by a grandmother, and turn sinister after he states "now if you'll kindly hold this for me." Later, Rahel suggests that Ammu marry this figure, who had invited Estha behind his counter and given him two free bottles. For 10 points, identify this beverage vendor from The God of Small Things who molests Estha.

answer: {eigenvalues}

Sylvester's Inertia Law claims that specific types of these objects do not change in quantity under a congruence transformation. Lanczos Algorithm is useful for computing these entities, which are capable of being bounded by Gresgorin discs. Lyapunov's Second Theorem states that a linear state space model dx over dt is equal to the state matrix times the state vector and is asymptotically stable if all real parts of these entities of the state matrix are negative. The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem deals with the fact that a minimal polynomial must divide an entity associated with these numbers. That entity can be found by setting the determinant of A-X times the identity, in which case the solutions X of that characteristic equation are these numbers. With a sum equal to the trace of the matrix and symbolized by lambda, these are, for 10 points, what scalars which, when multiplied by a matrix, are equal to that matrix times the corresponding eigenvector?

answer: {Alvin Toffler}

This thinker linked the economic decline of the mid 1970s to the lack of “transnational regulatory order” over large corporations in his book The Eco-Spasm Report. The implications Desert Storm had on future warfare were discussed in another work by this man, whose most recent book stresses the importance of “third jobs,” which are the unpaid work that benefits large corporations. In addition to War and Anti-War and Revolutionary Wealth, he also coined the term “prosumer” while discussing the title stage of society, which followed an agricultural and an industrial age. That work, The Third Wave, was preceded by a work that described the rapid changing of society and described the title condition as “too much change in too short a period of time.” For 10 points, name this American sociologist, a futurologist best known for his 1970 book Future Shock.

answer: The {Apotheosis} of {Homer}

In this painting, a pregnant woman dressed in blue holds two paintbrushes in her left hand, while her right hand holds the hand of the woman standing behind her. Commissioned shortly after its artist was asked to paint The Martyrdom of St. Symphorian, it also depicts a man in black looking outward at the viewer and pointing towards the work's central figure. A sword wrapped in a red ribbon and a triangular oar lie near two women dressed in orange and green. A man on this work's left holding a scroll is identified as Sophocles, and other famous individuals depicted in it include Gluck and Moliere. A mask, a gavel, and a lyre are all offered to this painting's central figure, who holds a staff and sits next to a floating Nike.

It began after Colonel Buller's scouts saw a group of goat herders, after which Buller correctly predicted that a contingent of enemy troops were concealed nearby. Knowing that Garnet Wolseley was approaching to take charge of his command, Lord Chelmsford hastened his advance and ignored enemy offers for a cease-fire. This battle lasted for only thirty minutes and saw Chelmsford deploy a large, hollow square formation in an effort to avoid a repeat of the Battle of Isandlwana. Leading to the capture of Cetshwayo, for 10 points, name this final battle of the Zulu War named after that tribe's capital.

The title character of this story takes small sips of water to moisten his lips and ignores the striking of the clock, the only furnishing of his home. Over the megaphone, several details of the title character are announced as he is led to a table by two ladies, one of whom breaks into tears while holding his hand as the other bears the entirety of his body weight. Before that incident on the fortieth day of his job, the title character is guarded by three butchers. He is left to rot in the straw by the impresario, who instead attends to the popular caged animal. When an attendant finds him, the title character explains with his last words that he took the title profession because he could not find any food he liked.

One poem in this collection describes the “train-bands and mates” of the world, who consist of Wit, Conversation, Glory, Money, and Beauty. Another poem mentions “clothes… taken from a chest of sweets” that quickly consign infants to their deaths. This collection contains “A Quip,” “Mortification” and poems describing a “glass of blessing standing by,” as mankind is endowed with virtue and “decaying more and more/till he became/most poor.” The speaker exhorts “with thee/o let me rise/as larks harmoniously” in that poem, which contains two pairs of stanzas that contract toward the middle, imitating the shape of the title objects. “The Pulley” is found in, for 10 points, what collection that contains “Easter Wings,” written by George Herbert?
