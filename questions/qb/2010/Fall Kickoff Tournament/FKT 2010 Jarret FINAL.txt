answer: {iron}

Most red giants will eventually fuse into a core of this element before going supernova. Every radioactive element with a mass above that of this element will eventually decay primarily into it, although it is possible to fuse isotopes of elements heavier than it into metastable nucleides. When it is neutrally charged, it has an unfilled d shell, and often has a charge of +2 or +3. A lack of this element in blood causes anemia. For 10 points, name this most stable element in the universe, whose ions are often called ferrous or ferric.

answer: {Mercury}

BepiColombo is scheduled to visit it in 2019.  MESSENGER is currently making flybys around this planet, which has a weak atmosphere that contains sodium and potassium.  Before MESSENGER, only Mariner 10 had visited it, and it may contain a liquid iron core that produces the second-strongest magnetic field within the asteroid belt.  A theory that said a planet named Vulcan lied within its orbit was discredited after general relativity was used to explain its precession at perihelion.  Its day and year are locked into a 2:3 ratio, and the largest crater on it is Caloris Basin.  For 10 points, name this smallest planet, the closest to the sun.

answer: Lysosomes 

Mannose-6-phosphate tags enzymes headed to this organelle. Pompe's disease, Hurler syndrome, Fabry disease, and I-cell disease can all be caused by malfunctions within this organelle. The storage of ganglioside within this organelle in neuronal cells can cause Tay-Sachs disease, and they were discovered by Christian de Duve. The membrane around this organelle allows it to maintain the 4.5 pH level that it requires for operation. This is, for 10 points, what organelle that serves to digest waste and food within a cell?

answer: Niels Henrik David {Bohr}

One constant named after this scientist is the magnetic dipole moment of an electron, his namesake magneton. His namesake ratio, approximately equal to 1/137, is also called the fine structure constant, and is the ratio between the velocity of electrons orbiting a nucleus and the speed of light. His model of an atom included a liquid drop of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, and replaced the Rutherford model. For 10 points, name this Danish physicist whose atomic model more importantly was the first to propose that electrons were in shells orbiting the nucleus.
