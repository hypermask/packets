answer: {black hole}

The Kerr solution to Einstein's field equation describes these entities which are rotating and the Reissner-Nordstom solution to Einstein's field equations describes one of these with a charge.

It has been posited that a supermassive variety of these could lie in the center of galaxies. For 10 points, name these entities which don't allow anything, even light, to escape when it crosses their event horizon.

answer: {normal} force [prompt on {weight}, prompt on {Fn} or {F sub n}]

When an object hits a surface, this force provides for the deceleration of the object. For an object resting at an angle, this quantity can be calculated by multiplying the mass times the acceleration due to gravity times the cosine of the angle at which the object is resting. One of the basic quantities in mechanics, this force can be calculated for any object lying perpendicular to ground by mass times the acceleration due to gravity. For 10 points, name this force, the force which is required to hold an object in place which always occurs perpendicular to the object.
