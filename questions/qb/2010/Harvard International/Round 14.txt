After this character exits in the first act one man attributes his behavior to “overwork” before telling a story about a quack doctor who claimed work was “the deadliest habit known to science” and sold rattlesnake oil as a medicine.

In the fourth act this character says he felt so guilty because his wife forgave all of his faults that he shot his wife Evelyn while she was sleeping. The policeman Lieb and Moran arrest this character after he confesses to murder, which drives Don Parritt to admit he betrayed his Anarchist mother to Larry Slade.

answer: {torque}

The magnetization of the free layer of a ferromagnet is given as the sum of four forms of this quantity, including the Slonczewski form and the Landau-Lifshitz form. The measurement of this quantity allowed R. A. Beth to conclude that Laguerre-Gaussian lasers conferred a related quantity to light. The maximum of this quantity over field strength gives the magnetic moment in the Kennelly approach, and Liouville's generalization of Euler's equations to nonrigid motion gives this quantity for each of three axes. Its presence in a system can induce precession. For 10 points, name this quantity, equal to the cross product of force and lever arm, which is the time derivative of angular momentum and the rotational analogue of force.

answer: vitamin B12 [prompt on {cobalamins} before mention; accept {methylcobalamin} before mention; accept {cyanocobalamin} before mention]

This compound's total synthesis involves the cyclization of methionine to create alpha-corrnorsterone, which contains this compound's D-ring. Katzung showed that the step that employs this compound to activate methionine synthase is the rate-limiting step of methionine synthesis. This compound is a cofactor in the conversion by methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase of methylmalonic acid to succinate. This compound can reverse dexamethasone-induced cleft palate in rodent embryos. Its synthesis was made more intimidating by its nine chiral centers, six of which are consecutive; that synthesis was achieved by Woodward and Eschenmoser. Vitamers of this vitamin include one that includes an adenosyl ligand, which is sometimes called dibencozide. This vitamin is lacking in pernicious anemia. This vitamin's forms all possess a cobalt center chelated by a porphyrin-like system with three L-type bonds and one X-type bond. For 10 points, name this vitamin whose most air-stable form is cyanocobalamin, a B vitamin intimately involved in metabolism.

answer: {Nelson Goodman}

This philosopher called pictorial symbol systems “syntactically and semantically dense” and elucidated two categories of works of art, based on whether it could be said that they were forged, allographic and autographic, and contrasts the relationships of “resemblance” and “representation.” The doctoral thesis of this author of Languages of Art was reworked into The Structure of Appearance and outlined a calculus of individuals that did not invoke set theory. He did, however, use set theory in a work written with Leonard that has provided the starting point for much of American mereology; that decision reflects his work with Lesniewski in founding contemporary nominalism. This philosopher is best known for an argument given contra Hempel's confirmation theory that introduced two concepts that were lacking in projectibility, but otherwise seemed as natural as other qualifiers. For 10 points, name this philosopher who addressed a “new riddle of induction” in Fact, Fiction, and Forecast and introduced the hypothetical colors “grue” and “bleen.”

answer: {Fischer-Tropsch}

A natural analogue of this process features the reaction between olivine, water, and carbonic acid to give serpentine, magnetite, and the products of this process. A variation of this process that employs water gives highly branched products and is named for Kölbel and Engelhardt. The mechanism proposed by Ponec for this reaction explains the deviations of its products from a Schulz-Flory distribution. The commonly accepted mechanism for this reaction was proposed by Cheryl Rofer-DePoorter and, unlike the earlier Pichler-Schulz mechanism, includes chain growth steps besides alkyl migration to carbonyl. Nickel is avoided for this procedure because of its tendency to favor the formation of methyl, which is the source of one of its starting materials through steam reforming. The distribution of chain length for the products of this reaction is given by the weight fraction of n-length chains over n equals the square of one minus chain growth probability alpha, all times alpha to the n-1. For 10 points, name this process by which carbon monoxide and hydrogen are converted to hydrocarbons.

In the center of this work a shadowed figure holding a rifle looms over an embracing couple.

answer: clouds

Matveev developed a two-parameter model to predict which type of these objects will form. One model of the formation of these objects has been extended to organic seeds by Pandis, and they may form in response to orographic uplift. One process that occurs in these objects is named for Bergeron. The formation of these objects are studied in Köhler theory. Ice caps are a type of this object that form over nuclear detonations. These objects may have “overshooting tops” that, if they are present continuously, indicate that these objects are part of a supercell. Noctilucent examples may contain thin sodium and iron coats, leading to their unusually high tendency to reflect radar. Large-scale organizations of these entities include actinoform, open-cell, and closed-cell. Nacreous ones sequester nitric acid, altering nitrogen and chlorine cycles and damaging the ozone layer. For 10 points, name these objects studied in nephology, which come in forms like cirrus and cumulus.
