answer: {Stagger Lee Shelton} [accept {Lee Shelton}, {Stagolee}, {Stackerlee}, {Stackolee}, {Stackalee}]

According to one source, this figure is haunted by a lion with a blue steel in his hand after his most famous action, and this figure's wife frequented the Silver Moon saloon and always bet a stack of silver dollars. In some stories this figure's most famous possession is made from the raw hide of a man-eating panther that the devil skinned alive. This figure belonged to a group called “the macks” in St. Louis, and in one story this man's most famous action came after a card game. Other versions state that it took place on Christmas eve in a cab after a heated political discussion, and both versions note that this figure was trying to recover his stolen stetson hat. This figure was guilty of the murder of Billy Lyons and eventually died in prison. Sharing many similarities with Railroad Bill as the archetypal representative of the southern “badman,” for 10 points, identify this African American folk hero.

answer: {adiabatic} theorem

This theorem was extended to unbounded operators by Avron, Seiler, and Yaffe and to a segment of that operator's spectrum, rather than an isolated eigenvalue, by Nenciu. This theorem gives a small error term given by the exponential of negative 2pi times lambda, where lambda is a squared over h-bar times the magnitude of alpha and a is the half-distance between the unperturbed energies at the avoided crossing; that is the Lander-Zener formula and gives the probability of transitions not of this type. This theorem holds that the eigenstates of a quantum harmonic oscillator can change in time as the spring constant varies slowly. For 10 points, name this theorem of quantum mechanics that shares its name with a term describing processes in which monatomic ideal gases change such that pressure times volume to the five-thirds is constant, those with no heat transfer.

This painter showed an ostrich egg hanging from a dome that overlooks the Virgin sitting on an oriental rug while surrounded by saints in the Montefeltro Altarpiece, which is sometimes called the Brera Madonna. One of this artist's paintings was originally in a frame with the inscription, “Convenerunt in Unum” leading some scholars to suggest it is an allegory for the reconciliation between the Byzantine and Roman Churches. In one work this artist showed a king sleeping in a yellow and red tent while an angel descends from the top left. Adoration of the Holy Wood, The Meeting of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and Constantine's Dream are frescoes in his series The Legend of the True Cross. This teacher of Luca Signorelli painted a scene whose right side shows three men in contemporary dress in an outdoor courtyard, while the left side is set inside a classical temple and depicts Pontius Pilate watching guards whip Christ.

answer: {titanium}

One chloride of this element may be used with dibromomethane and zinc metal to convert ketenes to allenes in a method found independently by Lombardo and Takai. This element's affinity for oxygen is essential to the second step of the McMurry reaction; another chloride of this element is used to activate silyl enol ethers. This element's trichloride is used in polypropylene production. The two processes used to obtain this element use reduction with coke and fractional distillation followed by liquid metal reduction; the first used sodium and the second used more easily recycled liquid magnesium. Impurities of this element's dioxide give star sapphires their asterism. This metal is the center of the Petasis reagent, and it is also found in Tebbe's reagent, which is an aluminum-containing metallocene of this element. This element is found with aluminum in Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Isolated by the Hunter and Kroll processes, for 10 points, name this strong metal which is extracted from ores called ilmenite and rutile.

Pierre Hadot's “The Myth of Narcissus” refutes the notion that this man's work is “autoerotic.” Ambrose's “On Jacob” draws on a tract wherein this man compared the earthly body of the sage to a lyre that will be used while serviceable though eventually the sage must sing without it. He also compared the process of self-purification to a sculptor chiseling pieces of stone off his work until it is perfect. He claimed the divine love was gentle, unlike “Beauty”, which would ultimately be terrifying; that line of argument is the foundation of his Against the Gnostics. He was the subject of a biography by the author of the Isagoge and in this man's philosophy, both Soul and Intellect are progressive emanations of The One, to which he is devoted. For 10 points, name this teacher of Porphyry, a Neoplatonic philosopher who wrote The Enneads.

Holzgang proposed a method for measuring this quantity using a handheld radiometer, and Niklas and Enquist studied its partitioning. This term is paired with “recalcitrance” to describe the resistance of plant fibers to degradation by microbes. A study of the relationship between this quantity, alpha diversity, and functional biodiversity found that its increase with alpha diversity was highest for small, isolated ecosystems while its increase with functional diversity was constant as ecosystem size. Its vertical distribution is a major determinant of plant fitness. Primary productivity is defined as the rate at which this quantity increases among autotrophs. This quantity decreases sharply as one ascends an ecological pyramid, and in some applications excludes water or mineral tissue like bone; in other cases it is measured in terms of organically bound carbon atoms. For 10 points, name this term that refers to the total quantity of living organisms in an ecosystem, often measured in grams.

answer: {cosmic rays}

An early theory of phenomena linked to these particles, supposed that they involved a cascade of gamma ray and positron-electron pair production. The Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula arises from the former's study of these particles. The strong magnetic field that follows a coronal mass ejection leads to a decrease in their intensity. Clear plastic sheets are etched by warm sodium hydroxide to detect these particles; the sheets are etched faster at the locations of collisions with them. Some isotopes of chlorine and aluminum form through a process involving these particles. Pions would be produced through the delta process via interactions with the CMB were any of these particles to exceed fifty million teraelectronvolts, an energy called the GZK limit. The proportion of these particles that are the endproducts of stellar fusion are spallated into “secondary” ones, which are lighter and less commonly stellar synthesis endpoints. For 10 points, name these energetic particles from outer space, mostly protons.
