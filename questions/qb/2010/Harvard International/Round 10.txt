answer: {viscosity}

This quantity is given by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation near the glass transition temperature. This quantity is given as lambda times T to the three-halves over T plus Sutherland's constant in one model. Dashpots are combined with springs to model systems for which its contributions matter at the same conditions as elasticity, such as the Kelvin-Voigt model, which accurately measures polymer creep. It decreases following the sustained application of sheer stress for thixotropic materials. The contributions of this quantity is negligible when the Euler equations apply and when the Reynolds number is large. This quantity is constant for Newtonian fluids. For 10 points, name this quantity, which is zero for superfluids.

answer: {Wonder} Bread

This product was first introduced by the Taggert Company, which also ran a bank in Indianapolis. The credit for inventing this product is usually given to Elmer Cline. The makers of this product sponsored the TV show Howdy Doody, whose host often told the audience that this product builds strong bodies in 8 ways, a reference to the minerals and nutrients added to this product during the 1940's, which helped decrease pellagra. This product notably has no holes, because it is made from batter and not dough.

answer: {variational principle} [or {variational} method]

The typical form of this method that is used for nuclear processes cannot account for two-body problems without the developments of Balian and Vénéroni. Kato found a better bound for energies given using this technique. This method can require the use of a secular determinant whose terms are combinations of the overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements. Basis sets used in conjunction with an extension of the simplest form of this method, whose Ritz type uses only linear combinations of functions, are often denoted “double-zeta” and are marked with two asterisks if d and f orbitals are included to account for polarization. Gaunt and Slater showed that the Hartree-Fock method should begin with an invocation of this sort of technique. Parameters optimized according to this statement typically include the linear and exponential coefficients of Gaussians and of Slater-type orbitals, which form a trial wavefunction. For 10 points, name this statement that the exact wavefunction minimizes a certain expression for its corresponding energy.

answer: The {Large Bathers} (accept {Les Grandes Baigneuses}; accept The {Bathers})

The trees appearing in this painting were influenced by a print the artist saw of Titian's Diana and Actaeon. In a Freudian analysis of this painting's artist, T. J. Clark used the term “double figure” to describe a character on the right side of this painting whose shoulders are indistinguishable from the buttocks of a woman standing above her. This work in the Philadelphia Museum of Art is often compared to a painting on the same theme in the Barnes Collection. Two groups of diagonally pointed trees form a triangle that frames the central scene where one lone person is seen swimming in the water. This painting features thirteen figures on the shore whose skin tones are washed out because the artist left the work unfinished at his death in 1906 after finishing many paintings of Mt. Saint-Victoire. For 10 points, name this painting showing the titular group of nude women relaxing around a pond, by Paul Cezanne.

answer: The {Trauma} of {Birth}

This work demonstrates in one chapter how the Cora-Indians associate the stars with the underworld and logically conclude the sky is a place of fertility before describing how Brahmins spend three days taking a posture related to the title event. A subsequent discussion of the softening inherent to aesthetic treatment, as in Lucas Cranach's Crucifixion, expands on representations of the central “concept of punishment.” Besides those chapters on “Religious Sublimation” and “Artistic Idealization,” this work examines the anxiety of a child left in a dark room, and attempts to use similar explanations of fear of animals. It catalyzed a separation with Freud by claiming the existence of a pre-Oedipal stage, and sought to claim that the titular event was the source of all anxieties. For 10 points, identify this work of Otto Rank, which argues that neuroses all stem from the titular phenomenon, a seminal work of perinatal psychology.

answer: {crystal growth} [or {crystallization}; or equivalents like making synthetic {crystals}; accept anything that is {too specific} for “{crystal}”, {e.g.}, {making synthetic diamonds} or {making silicon}]

One method of performing this process uses a reflaxicon to convert a laser beam into a uniform hollow cylinder and can use a rotating platinum wire, and a more conventional method, unable to sustain the same pulling rate, involves passing a high-frequency current through a copper coil used to heat an iridium crucible and is named after Czochralski. Chemical vapor deposition is a variety of the “vapor-phase” form of another method for doing this; the “homo-“ form of that method involves a substrate of the same chemical composition as the desired result. That method, epitaxy, involves performing this process in a layer-by-layer fashion. Flame fusion, or the Verneuil process, was the precursor for modern methods of doing this and was used to make the first synthetic gemstones. This process is typically preceded by nucleation, and it starts with the formation of a seed. For 10 points, name this process of making well-ordered solid materials.

answer: “I {Sing} the Body {Electric}”

One section of this poem asks, “How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries,” after mentioning “the same red-running blood” which “swells and jets a heart.” One line from this poem mentions “dull-faced immigrants” and notes that everyone is part of a procession, and “the universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.” Another section of this poem ends, “pause, listen, count” after noting the “bent head, the curv'd neck, and the counting” in a part which discusses firemen who march in their own costumes and a swimmer who goes through the “transparent green-shine.” Another section of this poem notes the “immeasurable meaning” of the black eyes of a “common farmer,” who is eighty years old and has five handsome sons. That section ends with the hope, “that you and he might touch each other.” This poem from the “Children of Adam” series ends with the line, “O I say now these are the soul,” after discussing reproductive systems and launching into a catalogue of body parts. Containing the line, “and if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?” for 10 points, identify this poem by Walt Whitman that praises the human form.

In this work's last chapter, the author cites Karl-Otto Apel's comparison of Wittgenstein and Heidegger's questioning of metaphysics and considers the difference between mainstream and peripheral thinkers in contrasting “systematic” and “edifying” forms of the first title entity. In a section on psychology, this work cites the confusion between causation and inference in cognitive psychology contra Fodor. This work contrasts Sellars's criticism of the idea of givenness with Quine's criticism of the structure-content distinction, claiming that a premise of both arguments is that knowledge is “a matter of conversation and of social practice.” The author of this work describes his position as “epistemological behaviorism.” For 10 points, name this attack on representationalism and “truth as correspondence” that called epistemological questions about the accuracy of the title reflector of reality unanswerable and irrelevant to social theory, a work by Richard Rorty.
