answer: {Ehrenberg}-{Siday}-{Aharonov}-{Bohm} effect

Static metrics on spacetime manifolds with nonzero first Betti number, such as an infinite rotating cylinder, give a family of solutions that are locally the same but globally distinct in a gravitational analogue of this effect reported by John Stachel. Resistance oscillations as a function of magnetic flux were observed in nanotubes by Bachtold as a consequence of this effect. This phenomenon emerges from gauge invariance much as charge quantization emerges from the existence of magnetic monopoles. Its magnetic type gives a phase shift proportional to the path integral of the vector potential sometimes named for Berry, and it is usually observed following a particle's motion around a solenoid, and it was verified when it was observed that the interference pattern of a beam of uniform energy electrons had changed. For 10 points, name this phenomenon predicted by Ehrenberg and Siday in which a charged particle in a region where the B and E fields are excluded is nonetheless affected by the vector potential.

answer: {Yazoo} land {fraud} [accept equivalents like “{scandal}”]

This event is often grouped with a similar event called the Pine Barrens scandal. The aftermath of this scandal saw the election of Governor Jared Irwin and the resignation of Senator James Jackson. The early stages of this event saw the creation of Bourbon County by George Matthews, which was opposed by a group called the Combined Society. Patrick Henry headed one of the companies involved in this event, which was given money by Governor Telfair, and this event came out after a bill signed by George Matthews. The court case resulting from this event was the first to find a state law unconstitutional. For 10 points, identify this land scandal of Georgia and Mississippi which led to the 1810 court case Fletcher v. Peck.

answer: {Tractatus Theologico}-{Politicus} [or {Theologico}-{Political Treatise}]

Its sixth chapter contends that the creator of the natural laws of the world would be acting against his own nature if a miracle were to contradict them. This work rejects Alpakhar's thesis that reason must be informed by Scripture., refuting that philosophy and theology belong to the same realm. It contends that the only limit on a sovereign's power is the power of the “multitude,” and it supports the views of Franciscus van den Enden. It posits that the explanation for the continued existence of the Jewish people lies in circumcision and claims that the Torah should be regarded as ancient Israel's constitution that is now invalid since that state no longer exists. This work was intended to provide a preemptive defense for a work its author planned to publish later, the posthumous Ethics. For 10 points, name this critique of organized religion and defense of secular government written by Baruch Spinoza.

answer: {holographic principle}

This statement can be invoked to derive gravitational lensing from the entropy per wavelength of blackbody radiation. A statement similar to this one, advanced by Louis Crane, inspired Carlo Rovelli to develop a class of “relational” quantum theories. Erik Verlinde, in the context of this statement, provides a description of gravity as an entropic force. One formalism related to this statement relates the product of an anti-de Sitter space with a manifold to a conformal field theory and is also called the Maldacena duality. Its relation to the worldsheet description of string theory was outlined by Susskind. Its discoverer was motivated by finding that the bump on the event horizon of a black hole emitting Hawking radiation has a predictable logarithmic shape. This statement was motivated by the result that a region's maximal entropy is proportional to the squared radius. For 10 points, name this statement first advanced by 't Hooft (eht HOOFT), which holds that the information in a volume of space can be encoded on its boundary.

answer: {Zygmunt Bauman}

This man is the subject of a Peter Beilharz work subtitled “Dialectic of Modernity.” In one work, this man argued that fragmentation, discontinuity, and inconsequentiality make planning for the long term risky. A recent work claims the welfare state is the last manifestation of Bentham's panopticon; that work is subtitled “conversations with Citlai Rovirosa-Madrazo.” The author of Alone Again: Ethics After Certainty and Living on Borrowed Time, he drew upon Simmel's allegorical notion of “the stranger”, who is at the root of both decreased trust in society and increasingly exciting choices. The author of Modernity and Ambivalence, this man skirts the notion of “postmodernity” by discussing “solid” and “liquid” modernity, a notion apparent in a work positing that procedural rationality in modern societies is linked to the massacre of the Jews.

answer: molecular {motors} [accept {motor proteins} after “{natural examples}”]

One of these systems relies on the chiral ring opening of a biaryl lactone, whose mechanism had been described by Branchaud. An early example of one of these systems contained an aminated triptycene group bonded to a [4]helicene with an important 3-hydropropoxy group discovered by Kelly et al. One of these systems uses two nanometer long stalks of polymerized iceane and fullerene “blades” and is powered by electron tunneling. The fastest example of one of these systems to date is synthesized by the Barton-Kellog reaction, which couples ketones to thioketones via a diazo intermediate; that molecule is asymmetric, possessing a tert-butyl group and a fluorene component. Feringa developed objects of this type driven photochemically. Natural examples include kinesins, as well as the F-naught-F-one ATP synthase, the axle of which rotates due to a proton gradient. For 10 points, name this set of molecular machines that consumes energy to generate mechanical work.

While living in this polity, the 12th century linguist Aggavamsa published his famous grammar of the Pali language. One successor state to this polity was founded by the Three Shan Brothers, and King Kyawswa briefly managed to revive this polity as a puppet state. This polity was founded in response to raids by the Nanzhao kingdom, which forced Pyinbya, this polity's first ruler, to build a fortified capital. At the height of its power, this empire controlled the north side of the Strait of Malacca and competed with its eastern neighbor, the Khmer Empire. This empire collapsed in 1286 after forces sent by Kublai Khan sacked its namesake capital, leading to Mongol suzerainty over the Irrawaddy basin.

answer: Symphony of {Psalms}

This work's opening E-minor chord is oddly articulated so most of the orchestra plays G rather than E and B, the chord's root and fifth which are usually emphasized when writing a triad, which prefigures the movement's shocking end on a G-major chord. In this work's second section an instrumental fugue beginning on the oboes clashes with a “human fugue” of a capella singers in what the composer called “an upside down pyramid of fugues” before they unite to form a double fugue on the line, “Et immisit in os meum canticum novum.” The composer's memoir Dialogues and a Diary revealed the triplets for trumpets and piano in the “allegro” section of the third movement represent horses carrying a chariot up to Heaven. This work's score omits violas, clarinets, and violins, and its three movements were written to symbolize the hortatory virtues love, hope, and faith because the composer had just converted to the Russian Orthodox Church. Commissioned by Serge Koussevitzky for the 50th anniversary of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, for 10 points, name this choral symphony taking its Latin text from its namesake biblical book, composed by Igor Stravinsky.

answer: hemoglobin

The polymerization energy of one form of this protein is given in an assay using concentrated dextran, which decreases its solubility via crowding effects. One disease related to this protein can be detected by mixing the mutated form of this protein in a sodium dithionite solution, is treated with hydroxyurea, and involves a glutamate to valine mutation. Hydrops fetalis sees the formation of a form of this protein named for St. Bartholemew's Hospital. Various thalassemias arise when the synthesis of one component or another of this protein is inhibited, and two embryonic forms of this protein are named for Gower. Part of this protein's name comes from a fold of eight alpha helices common to each of its four subunits; the other part of this protein's name comes from the group with which that fold associates, a porphyrin ring surrounding an iron atom. For 10 points, name this protein that transports oxygen in the blood.
