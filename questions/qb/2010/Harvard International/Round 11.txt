answer: {peptidoglycan} [accept {murein} before mention]

The protein synthesized in the most copies in E. coli is an alpha helix rich lipoprotein discovered by Braun; one-third of those copies bind covalently through the C-terminal lysine to this substance. The topical antibiotic bacitracin inhibits the function of bactoprenol in the synthesis of this substance, and NOD1 recognizes meso-DAP, which is found here. Teichoic acids and this substance bind to surface layer homology domains. A pseudo-form of this substance features beta-(1,3) linkage and leads to the lysozyme-insensitivity of Archea. Penicillin-binding proteins are essential in the synthesis of this substance, which is one of few natural occurrences of D-amino acids. One component of this substance consists of alternating NAG and NAM linkages, the latter of which hosts a three to five amino acid sequence. For 10 points, name this polymer of sugars and amino acids also called murein, which is found in particularly large amounts in Gram-positive bacteria and which forms the cell wall.

answer: {reflection}

This phenomenon can be modeled for surfaces with parallel grooves by a distribution named for Heidrich and Seidel. One model of this phenomenon uses the microfacet approach of Torrance and Sparrow to deal with surface roughness, which assumes the slopes of surface cavities follow a normal distribution. That formulation, due to Oren and Nayar, simplifies in the case of uniform facet slope to a an approximation that exhibits a radiant intensity proportional to the cosine of the angle between observer line of sight and surface normal. Certain “highlights” in this phenomenon were introduced by Phong, and the aforementioned model is called Lambertian. The previously described type of this phenomenon contrasts with the behavior of perfectly “glossy” surfaces where radiant intensity is nonzero at only one angle, called specular. For 10 points, name this phenomenon exhibited by mirrors.

answer: {dynamic programming}

This technique is employed by the algorithm used to account for rain stoppages in one-game cricket matches and by an algorithm that finds the most likely trajectory of hidden states to result in a given sequence of observations named for Viterbi. A major result in this technique was employed in Robert C. Merton's paper on the intertemporal capital asset pricing model and is, in a continuous-time formulation, also named for Hamilton and Jacobi. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm employs this process for sequence alignment in bioinformatics; one implementation of that algorithm uses only big oh of n plus m space by using an optimization common in this technique first used in Hirschberg's algorithm. An equation governing this technique gives the value function of a state x as the max over all actions a available in x of F of x and a plus the discount factor times the value function of the state to which a takes x. This technique is employed to solve the knapsack problem and in a shortest-path algorithm partly named for Ford. The Bellman equation governs, for 10 points, what essential technique in computer science, in which one decomposes a problem into manageable, usually overlapping subproblems, which can often involve recursion?

answer: Concerto for {Orchestra}

In the exposition of the second theme in this work's first movement the flutes, high strings, and oboes play a version of the “Arab” theme in parallel triads, while the bass clarinet, first harp, and first clarinet play a version of the “germinal” motif that recurs throughout the piece. Conductor Georg Solti corrected a manuscript mistake so the tempo of one section was correctly marked “Allegro Scherzando” rather than “Allegretto Scherzando.” A solo for the side drum both begins and ends this piece's second movement in which a theme is played at different intervals first by two bassoons and then by duos of oboes, clarinets, flutes, and finally trumpets. This work's third section is considered representative of the composer's “night music,” while it quotes Shostakovich's Leningrad Symphony in its fourth movement titled “Intermezzo Interrotto.” This work's third movement is titled “Elegia” and its second is called “Giuoco delle coppie” or “A Game of Pairs.” For 10 points, name this concerto in five movements by Bela Bartok.

A reagent with two atoms of this element and two of chlorine appears in the Herz reaction, used in dye chemistry. Aryl ketones give amides using an ammonium salt of this element in a reaction whose Kindler modification uses morpholine and its elemental form and which is named for Willgerodt. One method of hydrogen production is a cycle named for this element and iodine. Catalysts with an aromatic ring that includes nitrogen and this heteroatom permits aliphatic aldehydes to undergo a condensation reaction analogous to the benzoin condensation; another example of umpolung is employing the formation of an acetal analogue that includes this element. Bonds between two atoms of this element are cleaved in a reaction named for Zincke. The pseudohalide tosylate is an acid of this element that includes a toluene group. Ylides containing this element are used to form epoxides in the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction. An acid containing this element is synthesized in the contact process. Another functional group containing this element is found in cysteine and was once called mercaptan. For 10 points, name this element in the same group as oxygen with a terrible smell.
