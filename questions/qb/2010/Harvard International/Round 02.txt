answer: {Mizoroki}-{Heck} reaction

A versatile, mild method to access pterocarpans was achieved by the Evangelista group using a variant of this reaction in which an extra step sees a nucleophilic replacement by hydroxyl, which results in tetrahydrofuran derivatives. Cationic complexes may be used for this reaction in order to favor the more electropositive site despite steric hindrance. Oxidative variations on this reaction are named for Fujiwara and Moritani. This reaction can be carried out without phosphine ligands in ionic liquids like BMIM-PF6. Often compared mechanistically to the Wacker process, this reaction, unless silver salts are used, can result in the migration of double bonds due to the kinetics of beta-hydride elimination and requires stoichiometric amounts of a strong base for the final reductive elimination step. For 10 points, name this organometallic reaction, the palladium-catalyzed coupling of a halide or pseudohalide to an alkene.

answer: {flu} drugs [accept equivalents]

The side effects of one of these compounds were linked to inhibition of exocytosis in PC12 cells in a study by Liu and Chen that synthesized that one from D-glucal using a Claisen rearrangement and a tandem aziridination and ring opening. The Corey total synthesis of one of these compounds begins with the asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction between butadiene and an acrylic ester. The inhibition of the M2 ion channel is a target of two of these compounds, adamantane derivatives called amantadine and rimantadine. The best known total synthesis of one of these generally begins with shikimic acid. Many of these compounds, like one marketed as Relenza, seek to inhibit neuraminidase. For 10 points, name this set of compounds, which includes zanamivir and oseltamivir and is intended to combat a set of orthomyxoviridae whose serotypes are classified according to an H-N nomenclature, like the swine and avian.

A model for the rate of this process's reverse is given by Martyanov and Muller. In wastewater treatment this process is triggered by polyacrylamide, and it is prevented in cement production by lignosulfonates. This process is triggered by sufficiently low values of a quantity that is calculated rigorously by the formulation of O'Brien and Hunter or the earlier work of Dukhin and Semenikhin. Classical kinetic models for this process are provided by von Smoluchowki, and most models of this process neglect surface conductivity and assume a thin double layer. This process occurs at zeta potentials of less than roughly plus or minus five. For 10 points, name this process, which is, along with coalescence and creaming, one of three forms of emulsion instability and which consists of the accumulation into flakes of the particles in a colloid.

answer: {Mossbauer} effect

An anisotropy in this effect results especially from planar configurations and is named for Goldansky and Karyagin; that anisotropy results from the anisotropy due to normal modes of the expected value of x2. This phenomenon occurs with frequency equal to the elastic incoherent structure factor, which corresponds to a value for neutrons or x-rays named for Debye and Waller. An enhanced signal-to-noise ratio is obtained when using the backscatter of conversion electrons instead of transmission in the form of spectroscopy associated with this effect. Lines observed in this effect occurs because the denominator in the expression h-bar squared k squared over 2M accounts for the mass of the whole lattice. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which crystals absorb gamma rays without recoil.
