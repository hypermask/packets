answer: {Klein}-{Nishina formula}

The total radiative loss rate predicted by this equation exhibits drops proportional to gamma squared, with which namesake “steps” are associated; those steps are sudden increases in the equilibrium spectrum of certain cosmic ray particles. Chao's experiments to test this equation, which seemed to find deviations in heavy elements, were later found to have been early evidence of pair production and annihilation. A primitive and incorrect form of this equation derived separately by Dirac and by Gordon omitted its final two terms since it neglected spin. This equation's classical precursor gives sigma as eight thirds pi times the square of quantity e squared over m c squared and was developed by J. J. Thomson. The differential form of this equation contains terms cubic, quadratic, and linear in the ratio of before and after photon energy. For 10 points, name this early result of quantum electrodynamics, which gives the differential cross section of photon scattering from a free electron.

At the 554 synod of Seleucia, Patriarch Joseph condemned the Nestorians for performing this ceremony on people who were not eligible for it. The biography of St. Hypatius is cited as proof that in the ancient Church, this ceremony could only be performed by a priest. James 5:14-15 is cited to defend the existence of this ceremony, which John Calvin condemned as “histrionic hypocrisy”. This fifth of the seven sacraments is often followed by Viaticum, a special giving of the Eucharist whose Latin name translates as “provisioning”, referring to the metaphysical journey that often follows this sacrament. For ten points, name this Catholic sacrament administered to the ill or dying.

Preparation of some devices used for these techniques require a column of heated copper metal which is reusable if hydrogen and nitrogen are subsequently passed through it. Reagents can be prepared for use with these techniques by refluxing with sodium wire and benzophenone, which is reduced to ketyl radical anion. Careful control of pressure allows for a reagent transfer technique called cannulation. A distillation procedure that is one of these techniques employs a Perkin triangle. Reactions requiring these precautions include couplings that use palladium zero ligated to triphenylphosphine, as well as the use of organozinc and organolithium. The best known of these techniques often features counterflow addition and the use of syringes and septa. For 10 points, name this set of laboratory techniques that include the use of a glove box, as well as employing a Schlenk line to deliver a neutral gas like nitrogen or argon.

answer: {iron}-{sulfur} proteins

The biosynthesis of this class of proteins requires scaffold proteins like, in E. coli, NfuA. That scaffold protein transfers a group to one of these compounds with an unusual function, which is the target of the poison sodium fluoroacetate, has a homologue called 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, and is called aconitase. A broken example of one of these compounds employs an auxiliary nickel atom to reduce carbon dioxide. One of these compounds binds ubiquinol or plastoquinol anion before shuttling the electron to cytochrome c or f; that example is Rieske protein. Often erroneously classified as members of this family include rubredoxins. Members of this family are involved in the synthesis of biotin and lipoic acid, the latter of which has two heteroatoms that originate in this family's namesake group. For 10 points, name this family of proteins, which derive its name from the type of two-element cluster compound they all contain and which include the ferredoxins.

One method for detecting these objects features an amplification as a function of the normalized angular parameter u equal to u^2+2 over u times square root u^2+4. Another method to detect them employing a hydrogen fluoride tank to capture more precise spectra was developed by Campbell, Walker and Yang and uses variation in radial velocity. One hypothesis about a subset of these objects advanced by Ward and Brownlee rejects the principle of mediocrity by setting out conditions such as a circular orbit around the galactic center and a sufficiently large primary to prevent tidal locking. Gravitational microlensing is used to detect these objects, which are generally not terrestrial if they orbit population II stars, which prevents life from developing. For 10 points, name these objects, large bodies that revolve around stars other than the sun.
