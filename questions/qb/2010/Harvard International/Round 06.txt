answer: Battle of {Koniggratz} [accept: {Battle} of {Sadowa}; {Battle} of {Sadova}; {Battle} of {Hradec Kralove}]

During this battle, General von Fransecky heroically cleared the Swiep Forest of all enemy forces. The losing army at this battle had been forced to retreat from an earlier defeat at the battle of Jitschin and began this battle with the Elbe River to their backs. Despite having a numerically superior force, General Ludwig von Benedek was defeated in this battle, in part because his opponents enjoyed the faster-firing “needle gun.” After this battle, the Treaty of Prague was forced upon Emperor Franz Josef, making this battle a major victory for Helmuth von Moltke and the Kleindeutsche policy of Otto von Bismarck. For ten points, name this decisive 1866 battle of the Austro-Prussian war.

answer: {peroxides}

One modification to the Hunsdiecker reaction uses molybdenum (VI) and one of these compounds. Following the addition of bromine and water and then calcium hydroxide, iron (III) acetate and one of these compounds is added in a sugar degradation, while it's iron (II) that is paired with one of these to process organic wastes like tetrachloro-ethylene or to hydroxylate arenes. These compounds rearrange into an alcohol and a ketone in a reaction observed in prostaglandin synthesis. Bottles of ether become dangerous to open after a few years due to the formation of these compounds. These compounds are used in the Fenton reagent and the Ruff degradation and they rearrange to a ketone and alcohol in the Kornblum-DeLaMare reaction. An acyl example of one of these compounds react by a butterfly mechanism with alkenes to give epoxides in the Prilazhaev reaction, and a meta-chloro benzene derivative reacts with ketones to give esters in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Reactions using the simplest example of this functionality are essential to green chemistry. For 10 points, name this functional group containing an oxygen-oxygen single bond, whose simplest example is H2O2.

answer: {barbiturates}

This class of drugs, as well as methylxanthines like caffeine, should be avoided by individuals with glucose transporter type I deficiency syndrome. The compound that is the namesake of this class of drugs is hydrolyzed and its ring opened in the second step of oxidative pyrimidine degradation, is involved in riboflavin synthesis, and forms other members of this class of compounds through the Knoevenagel condensation; that compound can be formed by a reaction between malonic acid and urea. This class of compounds increase the number of glycogen granules in astrocytes. Drugs in this class include the long-acting anticonvulsant phenobarbital and a compound that finds its major therapeutic use as an ultrashort anaesthetic but is better known as a truth serum drug, sodium thiopental. This class of drugs, which blocks the glutamate receptor AMPA, also increases the frequency of chloride channel opening when it binds to the alpha subunit of the GABAA receptor. For 10 points, name this class of central nervous system depressant drugs.

answer: {sediment}

The nondimensional volumetric flux of this quantity is proportional to the three-halves power of boundary shear stress minus critical boundary shear stress. Those relations were improved by employing a “hiding function” by Wilcock and Crowe. A conservation of mass equation that often includes a subsidence term that applies to its transport is called the Exner equation. It may be entrained in different manners according to the value of the Rouse number. One form of this material forms paha and greda ridges and is called loess, and its deposition can form mouth bars and oxbow lakes, the former of which creates distributary networks at river deltas. This material can be transported through saltation as part of the bed load. For 10 points, name this material transported by rivers whose buildup and compression forms a namesake kind of rock.

answer: {Miller}-{Modigliani} theorem [accept {capital structure irrelevance} before mentioned]

Jensen and Meckling expanded on this theory to account for the consequences of agency given asymmetric information. This result's discoverer debated Litzenberger and Ramaswamy over the value of the covariation in holding period return and dividend value. The phi term in Hamada's equation links this result with the capital asset pricing model.  This result is used to explode the EPS fallacy, as well as the weighted average cost of capital fallacy. With taxes it proposes that V sub L is equal to V sub U plus T sub C times D, indicating that the debt is multiplied by the tax rate to equate the unlevered and levered values. Regardless of taxes, however, this result proposes the irrelevance of capital structure. For 10 points, name this theorem of corporate finance, named for two economists.

This poetry collection features a poem beginning; “Oh, but it is dirty!” titled “Filling Station.” Another poem concerns a sandpiper running along a beach staring down at his toes “looking for something, something, something.” The title poem of this collection ends when the speaker wonders, “Is it lack of imagination that makes us come to imagined places, not just stay at home? / Or could Pascal have been not entirely right” after asserting, “There are too many waterfalls here”. The speaker of another poem laments “a weak mailed fist / clenched ignorant against the sky!” after watching the title creature run away while people throw fire balloons into the sky to celebrate a religious festival. This poetry collection includes a poem dedicated to Robert Lowell titled “Armadillo” while in the first poem “Arrival at Santos” is based on the poet's long sabbatical in South America.

answer: {neutrons}

A common source of these particles is a device named for Farnsworth and Hirsch. Direct observation of magnons and phonons is possible via Brockhouse's triple-axis spectroscopy, which employs inelastic scattering events of these particles. Due to these particles, metastable structures called intimate Frenkel pairs can develop in materials like graphite; those materials must be heated in a process called annealing to relieve the Wigner energy that builds up when bombarded by these particles. Violation of CP symmetry by the strong force would require an electric dipole moment for this particle a trillion times greater than the maximum current prediction. The emission of energetic examples of these particles sustain fission reactions, and their number is different for an element's isotopes. For 10 points, name these particles composed of one up and two down quarks, the chargeless component of the nucleus.

Herodotus reports that a temple to Hephaestus in Egypt featured a statue dedicated to these creatures after they helped the pharaoh Sethos defeat the armies of Sennacherib by destroying their weapons. According to Aelian, these creatures were worshipped at Hamaxitus, where they were fed at the temple of the deity with whom they are most often associated. That deity was Apollo Smintheus, whose epithet may have referred to his relationship with these creatures. While these animals were routing their most famous foe, Zeus sent an army of crabs to prevent these creatures from totally annihilating their enemies. That battle was precipitated when the king of these creatures was drowned while crossing a river on back of the king of their future enemies. That war was known as the Batrachomyomachia.
