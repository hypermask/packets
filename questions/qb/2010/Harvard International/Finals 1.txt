answer: {Rostam}

In one story, this figure defeated a lion by hiding in its den and distracting it with his steed, which was disguised as an elephant, and in another story this figure is confronted by a demon and asks to be thrown onto a mountain rather than into the sea. In his youth, this figure slayed a white elephant owned by King Manuchehr with only one blow from a mace, and this figure was so big at his birth that a caesarean section had to be performed on his mother Rudaba. This son of Zal rides the horse Rakhsh, and he performs seven labors culminating with the defeat of the White Demon and the rescue of Kay Kavus. He is perhaps most famous for a story in which after breaking a man's back during a fight, he discovered that he had mistakenly murdered his own son when the man reveals a piece of onyx. The father of Sohrab, for 10 points, identify this pre-Islamic hero of Persia whose deeds are recounted in Ferdowsi's epic Shahnameh.

A landscape artist from this movement depicted three baby bears climbing the splintered trunk of a tree while the mother bear watches in Morning in a Pine Forest. Another artist painted Pontius Pilate extending his hand to a demonic looking Christ standing in the shadows in Quod Est Veritas?, and did a version of the Last Supper in which the figure of Christ was based on a photo of the editor of the newspaper The Bell. This movement developed into the Society for Traveling Art Exhibitions and one of its leaders painted a woman in black rising from her chair to face the title character, returned from political exile, in They Weren't Expecting Him. Ivan Shishkin, Nikolai Ge, and Ivan Kramskoi were members of this movement, whose leader depicted Ivan Sirko collaborating on an insulting letter to Mehmed IV in the painting The Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks.

Onuchic and Wolynes borrow the formulation of “minimal frustration” from the statistical mechanics of spin glasses to describe this process. Richards used Voronoi polyhedra to examine the packing density predicted by one model of this problem. One subproblem of this process is resolved by the Complimentary Twist Model of Chothia and Janin. A namesake “funnel” model of this process features a “molten globule” state, and this process may be studied via circular dichroism spectroscopy. Statistical mechanical models of this process include studies of self-avoiding walks. Early theories of this process were supported by an experiment that featured the addition, then removal, of two equivalents of 2-mercaptoethanol and of urea; the dogma thus supported, which was a response to Levinthal's paradox, assumed a kinetically accessible free energy minimum and is named for Anfinsen. Since then, it appears that primary structure is not the sole determining factor. For 10 points, name this process by which polypeptides acquire tertiary structure.

Charles Trevelyan was a Treasury official who was placed in charge of the government response to this event.

One algorithm in this field was proved Probably Approximately Correct by Littman et al.; that algorithm waits for m sample updates before making internal changes to average out random effects and is very optimistic. The aforementioned is one of a class of “model-free” algorithms, such as forms developed by Watkins and Dayan. The study of the multi-armed bandit in this field elucidates the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. One form of this process is named for the function that calculates the desirability of a state-action pair, the quality function. When “supervised,” this process usually requires a human to select a training set. For 10 points, name this discipline of computer science which features the design of algorithms that allow computer agents to modify their behavior in accordance with gathered data.

One poem in this collection about a twilight stroll repeats the phrase, “water lilies calm and pale that shine where reeds are green frail”, while another poem describes an atmosphere imagined by Watteau, Le Notre, Wagner, and Goethe.

In one essay, this philosopher discusses a figure who could “do with evil precisely what he does with Rahab or with the shades” and concludes that that figure, who “sees in unity what you see in fragments,” suffers, thus resolving “The Problem of Job.” One chapter of one of his works traces its subject back to the second definition of knowledge given by Theaetetus and defines its subject as an “incomplete thought” that failed in its purpose according to a higher thought. Another chapter by this author explains the World of Interpretation using Pierce's “doctrine of Signs.” The former work is “The Possibility of Error” and requires the existence of “an infinite unity of conscious thought.” One of this author's works rejects conceptions of being such as mysticism, critical rationalism, and realism in its first volume, and then goes on to consider “Nature, Man, and the Moral Order”; that work is The World and the Individual. Ubiquitous to this author's work is the existence of an Absolute Knower. For 10 points, name this American idealist and author of The Problem of Christianity.

In one paper, Brieger et al. model coherent states as collections of in-phase precession states which each have initial sublevel populations proportional to these quantities. Harmut Schlosser offers a recursive method of computing these quantities. Analogues to these quantities that apply to more complex conditions are named for Fano and Racah, and these quantities are related to Wigner 3j symbols. One of these quantities appears in a statement along with an orientation-independent term; that statement is the Wigner-Eckhart theorem. These quantities permit the possibly-reducible representation that follows the tensor product of quantities such as spin to be given as the direct sum of an irreducible representation, and are symbolized as the bra j-one m-one j-two m-two times the ket J M. For 10 points, name these quantities central to calculating angular momentum coupling.
