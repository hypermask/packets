answer: {Op} Art

One artist associated with this movement created sculptures consisting of metal cords hanging from grids that form a maze, which he called “penetrables.” Another practitioner created a type of print called an “agamograph.” One leader of this movement named different aspects of his style after the geographical regions that inspired him including series titled Denfert, Belles Isles, and Gordes/Cristal. Early influences on this movement include the “Pandora” series and “Dazzle” panels designed by John McHale for the This is Tomorrow Exhibition and a painting titled Zebras. Yaacov Agam and Jesús Soto are artists associated with this movement that took its name from a Julian Stanczak exhibition. William Seitz organized this movement's premiere exhibition, The Responsive Eye, which featured the work of Victor Vasarely and Richard Anuszkiewicz. For 10 points, name this twentieth-century art movement associated with Bridget Riley that tries to create art filled with perceptual illusions.

answer: {threshold voltage} [accept {turn} on {voltage} before mentioned; do not accept “{saturation voltage}”]

The Fermi potential relates this parameter to the doping level of the semiconductor. In modern device processes, it is typically adjusted to the desired value by performing a channel stop implant. Empirically, it can be determined by extrapolating the slope of an I-V curve from the linear region to the x-axis. In p-channel devices, it is typically positive, while in n-channel devices it is typically negative. This characteristic describes the point when a strong enough vertical electric field exists to create an inversion channel on top of a depletion region in a MOSFET. For 10 points, name this potential, the point at which diodes or transistors turn on and allows current to flow, which is often referred to as V sub t.

answer: Marie Ennemond Camille {Jordan}

This man's lemma states that if a denominator of a polynomial quotient has a degree of one or more higher than the numerator, than the limit of contour integral of any upper half circle approaches zero. The expression of a linear operator as its semi-simple component and its nilpotent component is a decomposition named for this man and Claude Chevalley. One theorem which states that two composition series of a given are equivalent is named for this figure and Holder, and another theorem named for this man states that any simple closed contour separates the plane into an interior and exterior domain which both have the curve as its boundary. He names a form for operators whose characteristic polynomials split that consists of generalized eigenspaces for T-invariant subspaces. For 10 points, identify this French mathematician who gives his name to this canonical form, and who gives his name to a square matrix with eigenvalues in the diagonal and ones in the superdiagonal with zeroes everywhere else, known as his namesake “block.”

For surface chemistry, this quantity is proportional to surface coverage times number of sites, though for bimolecular cases it requires the models developed by Langmuir and Hinshelwood or by Eley and Rideal. “On water” reactions have an unexpected dependence solvent dependence of this property. Properties of the potential energy surface give estimates of this quantity for one case in an improvement that allowed for zero-point energies and normal mode contributions by Marcus to a theory originated by Rice, Ramsberger, and Kassel. For a long time, this quantity varies harmonically in the Briggs-Rauscher reaction. This quantity can be given as proportional to the reactant concentrations raised to exponents called orders; the constant of proportionality is itself proportional to the exponential of negative activation energy over ideal gas constant times temperature in the Arrhenius equation. For 10 points, name this quantity given by the time derivative of a product concentration over its stoichiometric coefficient, the speed at which a chemical transformation takes place.
