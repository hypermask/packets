answer: {Belshazzar's Feast}

A figure from Veronese's Rape of Europa was the basis for a woman on the right side of this painting who lets liquid spill from a golden vessel she is holding. The artist accidentally mistranscribed an inscription in this painting organizing the letters in columns rather than right to left. The central figure's right arm knocks over a holy silver chalice that was stolen from the Jewish Temple and blasphemously filled with wine. The main figure wears small crescent-moon earrings and a bejeweled turban topped by a crown. Rabbi Menasseh ben Israel gave the artist the Aramaic text “MENE MENE TEKEL UPHARSIN” that was used as the mystical inscription drawn by a floating hand in this painting based on a scene from the Book of Daniel. Featuring several figures based on the artist's studies of Jews in Amsterdam, for 10 points, name this Rembrandt painting showing a Babylonian king disturbed by writing on the wall.

answer: {Wittig} reaction [prompt by {saying} “{that's} the {aforementioned related reaction}” on {Julia olefination}; prompt by {saying} “{that's} the {ester modification}” on {Horner}-{Wadsworth}-{Emmons reaction}]

An ester modification of this reaction was improved by the use of bis (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) groups, KHMDS and crown ethers. A related reaction that gives the opposite stereoselectivity can employ a benzothiazole derivative that exploits the Smiles rearrangement; that reaction's product is formed following reduction with sodium or samarium iodide and begins with the reaction of phenyl sulfonate derivatives. Interconversion between possible stereochemistries in this reaction's intermediate occurs by the mechanism described by Maryanhoff and Reitz. One cold-temperature modification of this reaction uses phenyllithium and hydrochloric acid to convert to the threo betaine intermediate. The reagent needed is prepared by the SN2 substitution of an alkyl halide with triphenylphosphine, followed by deprotonation by base. This reaction effectively carries out a metathesis that requires a four-membered intermediate that greatly favors the formation of an oxygen-phosphorus double bond. Its ester modification, improved by Gennari and Still, is the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, and that related reaction using sulfones is named for Julia. For 10 points, name this reaction, which forms an alkene from a carbonyl.

answer: {MAPK} [or {mitogen}-{activated} protein kinases; or {MAP} kinases]

The first immediate-early gene to be found to be fully dependent on this family's namesake's best known pathway is sometimes used in a neuroscience assay called catFISH; that element is the plasticity factor Arc. Three unusual exemplars of this family contain SEG motifs in their activation loops. Like survival motor neuron protein, one example of this protein interacts with the activator of the far upstream element of c-myc. The p38 family of these is involved in differentiation and apoptosis, and another family of these proteins is involved in the inflammation response mediated by proteins like RANTES and is often called stress-activated; that family is the c-Jun N-terminal ones, while their classical subset includes RAF, which is activated by Ras. For 10 points, name this family of serine/threonine kinases that respond to mitogen stimulus.

A 1996 paper by this man concluded that holding rule of law, free markets, and human capital constant, democracy has a slight negative impact on a country's economic growth. He collaborated on a paper concluding that popes don't experience saint-making fatigue, part of his recent turn towards writing papers on religion with his wife Rachel McLeary. He collaborated with Gary Becker on “A Reformulation of the Economic Theory of Fertility”, while the textbook Economic Growth was the product of his collaboration with Xavier Sala-i-Martin. He drew on Sargent and Lucas for his 1976 paper “Rational Expectations and the Role of Monetary Policy”, while another paper argued that bond financing of deficits implies an anticipated future tax increase, in turn implying that an increase in government spending will not increase demand for goods.

Theories that do not include this substance include John Moffat's theory that G over c holds constant over time but neither quantity does individually and one proposed by Bekenstein called TeVeS. Its presence explains the formation of stellar structure through the Jeans instability. It may be accounted for by certain leptons with the opposite helicity from experimental prediction, called “sterile.” One model of this substance suffers from the “cuspy halo problem” and cannot explain the lack of many satellite galaxies a thousandth the size of the Milky Way. One hypothesized example of this substance is the Nambu-Goldstone boson that results from spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn symmetry; that particle accounts for the theta-bar term in strong CP violation and is called the axion. Its baryonic forms include brown dwarfs and MACHOs.
