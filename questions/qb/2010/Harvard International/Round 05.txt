answer: {alcohols} [accept {Dakin reaction} before “one {reaction}”; prompt on {Dakin reaction} before “{this functionality}”; accept {carboxylic acids} before “{DABCO}” is read, since {there's no reaction} that {uses DABCO} to {create carboxylic acids}]

One reaction that produces this functionality sees saponification follow peroxide oxidation of aryl aldehydes or ketones, and another reaction uses a DABCO [dab koh] catalyst to form allylic ones. One reaction that forms this functional group uses cesium trichloride to effect the methanolysis of sodium borohydride, thereby favoring the 1,2 reduction. The phenyl example of this functionality is far more stable than its tautomer, cyclohexadienone, and these compounds are formed without rearrangement in a hydroxymercuration-demercuration reaction. This functionality is formed in reactions named for Dakin and for Luche, as well as in the reaction of carbonyl with Grignard reagents. Reacting this functionality with base and then an alkyl bromide is an effective ether synthesis. For 10 points, name this functional group, which contains an -OH unit.

answer: {time reversal symmetry}

A simplification of the Frobenius criterion on space groups that gives the degeneracies that double under this statement's corresponding operator is named for Herring. The square of that operator is plus one for integral spin and minus one for half-integral spin. A criterion given by Wolfenstein for this property was applied by Sehgal and van Leusen to analyze CPLEAR, an experiment at CERN that showed a difference between the rates of antikaon to kaon transitions and kaon to antikaon transitions. Loschmidt's paradox concerns its violation in the molecular chaos assumption of Boltzmann's H-theorem. Noether's theorem relates this property to energy conservation. A theorem which would be violated were neutrons to have nonzero electric dipole moment holds that the product of this property with charge conjugation and parity is always preserved. Applying that to a black hole gives a white hole. For 10 points, name statemen, whose corresponding operator would cause events to happen backwards.

The tomb of Rameses VI contains a depiction of twelve heads representing the souls taken by this figure, and this figure was often depicted as a circular ball on tombs. In one story, this figure was born from the tears of the sun god, who was unable to see his mother because he was so bright. In some stories this figure possessed a flint head, and its name meaning “he who was spat out” refers to his birth when the archer goddess Neith spat him into the primeval waters. This figure was said to be aided by Mot and Sek, and during the seventh hour this figure was bound by Selk, Her-desuf, and Mehen. This figure's death came when it was chopped into pieces by a god in the form of a cat, and a ritual banishing of this creature involved smearing its effigy with mud.

answer: {chaos} theory

The sum of certain quantities that arise in this field gives the entropy by Pesin's theorem. Those quantities are involved in a matrix defined as the limit as t increases without bound of the Jacobian times its transpose all raised to one-half t; that limit is guaranteed to exist by the Oseledec theorem and those quantities are Lyapunov exponents. A result about one-dimensional systems in this field is Sharkovskii's theorem, and as two complex eigenvalues of a system emerge, a Hopf bifurcation can occur; the aforementioned theorem gives a result about systems with three-cycles. Three-cycles appear briefly on a plot of the behavior of the logistic map, which experiences period-doubling with a frequency that approaches the Feigenbaum constant. This field studies systems like the Roessler map, the double pendulum, and a result of a weather model called the Lorenz attractor; each of those objects often traces out enormously different trajectories after only small changes in initial conditions. For 10 points, name this field colloquially described by the metaphor of the butterfly effect.

answer: bone {morphogenic} protein

Juvenile hemochromatosis is an iron overload condition caused by mutations in hemojuvelin, which Babitt et al. believe is a cofactor for these proteins. Inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway by one factor antagonizes the action of these proteins; that aforementioned factor binds to LRP5/6 receptors and is called sclerostin. The expression of fibroblast growth factors and sonic hedgehog require the inhibition of these compounds by gremlin-1. The tenth of these is thought to facilitate heart tabeculation, and the seventh of these triggers SMAD phosphorylation. A metalloprotease in this group cleaves laminin five and three procollagen forms. Noggin and chordin maintain fetus polarity by inhibiting the fourth one of these, which, like many others, is a TGF-beta family protein. For 10 points, name these proteins that can induce new bone to form.

answer: {Human Action}

This work points out that “real peasants do not engage in ecstatic babble” in “The Myth of the Soil.” This work argues Lucien Levy-Bruhl's work supports its thesis of the uniformity of the logical structure of mind. That uniformity underlies the criticism of “Marxian polylogism” on the grounds that Marx arrogated to himself the right to find absolute truth; hence his polylogism is part of the “revolt against reason” discussed in the third chapter. This work draws on its author's argument against the time preference theories of his mentor Eugene Bohm-Bawerk and also considers the delimitation of the problems of catallactics. Socialism is criticized because it renders impossible the activity of monetary calculation, vital to entrepreneurship. Published seven years before The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality, this work contrasts its central concept with “contentment.” For 10 points, name this work deeming the study of its title concept “praxeology”, the magnum opus of Ludwig von Mises.
