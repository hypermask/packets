answer: tests of general {relativity} [accept {clear knowledge} equivalents]

Many tests of this theory have been designed to demonstrate constraints on a set of ten parameters named for Nordtvelt and Will. One test of this theory was a measurement of the Shapiro delay by the Cassini-Huygens probe, which also set a new lower bound at around forty thousand for omega, the coupling constant in Brans-Dicke theory. One test of this theory used a Mylar bag full of helium to minimize scattering while a vibrating loudspeaker cone on top of Jefferson Laboratory contained an iron sample emitting gamma rays. That experiment, carried out by Pound and Rebka, intended to cancel a Doppler redshift with a blueshift predicted by a certain theory of gravity. For 10 points, name this theory advanced by Einstein.

The left side features a two-faced statue of Janus, and above Apollo drives is chariot through the circle of the zodiac to announce the dawn. At the center of this painting four women symbolizing Poverty, Labor, Riches, and Pleasure swing in a circle while listening to a winged old man playing the lyre.

answer: {Angelman's} syndrome [prompt on {happy puppet syndrome} from {eugenicists}]

In this condition, a buildup of Arc protein reduces the surface expression of GluR1 and other components of AMPA receptors due to a lack of E6-associated ubiquitin ligase. A connection between this condition and fear conditioning in the mouse model is suggested by its effects on long-term synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. A test for this condition actually targets the neighboring SNRPN gene. This condition usually results from loss of expression of one copy of the Ube3A gene, typically through loss or improper imprinting of the maternal copy of a region on chromosome 15 that is also implicated in Prader-Willi syndrome. For 10 points, name this disorder characterized by an unusual gait, hand-flapping and a happy, laughing demeanor.
