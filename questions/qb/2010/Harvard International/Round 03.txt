answer: {Bell's theorem}

One generalization of this statement bounds a sum of the correlations between a, b, a', and b' between two and negative two. An inequality-free form of this statement concerns only perfectly correlated states and was developed by Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger. Doubt was cast on the former generalization, named for Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt, by the experiments of Alain Aspect, while the latter generalization of this statement, which attempts to explain wavefunction collapse when non-commuting variables are measured, is intended to explicitly distinguish entanglement and the possibility of hidden variables. For 10 points, name this statement, which suggests that no local hidden variables theory can reproduce all the results of quantum mechanics.

answer: {private language}

As part of a counterargument against this concept, Blackburn gives the example of a man who worries that car tires will become square after January 1, 1984, suggesting that conforming to “bent rules” is more than just a dispositional fact, indeed having real behavioral implications. The epistemological problem of other minds can be phrased as the suggestion that our beliefs about other people's mental states constitutes one of these. One of its conceivers used the example of a diary about a sensation initially denoted S, and questions whether the author would be able to continue to make the same connection between the sign and sensation without a “criterion for correctness,” which would have to be external. For 10 points, name this construct developed by Wittgenstein in Philosophical Investigations, the possibility of which he doubted because its creator couldn't possibly understand it.

answer: {Irrawaddy} River

N'mai and Mali rivers in Kachin Province. At one time this river flowed into the Sittoung and continued on to the Gulf of Martaban, and cities on its banks include Hinhada and Mogok. The first European to sail this river was a Venetian named Nicolo di Conti who was traveling to the city of Ava, and this body of water was the site of the golden barges of its kings. One city on this river was founded by King Mindon and was given a name meaning “Mound of Gems.” This river is often the site of the transport of teak logs, and much of this river's traffic is due to the fact that the nearby Salween River is barely navigable. Emptying into the Andaman sea and passing through the city of Mandalay, for 10 points, identify this river which empties into the sea at Yangon, the principal river of Burma.

answer: {cryptography} [accept equivalents]

Methods in this field employing elliptic curves were developed by Koblitz and Miller. A technique named for Cramer and Shoup is useful even if there existed an “oracle” resource that would almost always reverse it; that property is called “malleability.” One method employed in this field relies on a property of algorithms like Pollard's lambda for solving the discrete logarithm problem; that method often uses a “safe prime” to prevent the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm from working too quickly and is the Diffie-Hellman method. The majority of widely used methods in this field adhere to Kerckhoff's principle, which holds that systems should be secure even when their workings are public; such methods include RSA, whose security relies on the difficulty of factoring large primes. Naïve methods in this field include ROT13 and Caesar's cipher. For 10 points, name this study of the practice of hiding information.

answer: {Taxol} [or {paclitaxel}]

One synthesis of this compound uses a Corey-Chaykovsky reaction followed by epoxide opening to give the oxirane D ring and begins with the Wieland-Miescher ketone; that synthesis is by Danishefsky. Essential to one route to this compound is a pinacol coupling and a Shapiro reaction, which form the eight-membered B ring; that route relies on a convergent synthesis that links an amide tail to the A and C rings and was developed by Nicolaou. This compound is often delivered in Cremophor EL and ethanol, or it is bound to albumin and sold as Albraxane. This compound's commercial semisynthesis adds the Ojima lactam to the starting material from an early route to this compound, 10-deacetylbaccatin; that route was developed by Potier and quickly improved upon by Robert Holton.

answer: {coenzyme Q10} [or {ubiquinone}; or {ubidecarenone}]

Clofibrate and salicilic acid increase levels of this compound in rats, a result attributed to their agonistic effect on PPAR alpha. This compound is a cofactor in the uncoupling protein used in fatty acid-dependent proton transport, and it is a cosubstrate of the enzyme that effects de novo pyrimidine synthesis, DHOD. A synthetic analogue of this compound sometimes used to treat Friedrich's ataxia is idebenone, which is being tested as a treatment for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, which arises from mutations in the genes for the ND4, ND1 and ND6 subunits. One name for this compound comes in part from its ten isoprene repeats. A less energetic reaction this compound participates in is the oxidation of succinate to fumarate, and its reduction by NADH generates four cytosolic protons in its reduction by NADH in complex I. For 10 points, name this component of the electron transport chain, a quinone derivative which passes electrons to cytochrome c.
