answer: {hysteresis}

This phenomenon is incorporated in a neuron model derived by Abbott and Kepler that, save for that feature and a time-dependent threshold factor, is a type of Hopfield model. One process that displays this phenomenon exhibits the Barkhausen effect. This phenomenon, displayed by Schmitt triggers and memristors, results, in latching relays, from their bistability. Agar displays a form of this phenomenon in freezing and thawing, though the best known form of this phenomenon can be quantified as remanence and occurs due to a nonlinear relationship between H and B. For 10 points, name this phenomenon, most commonly associated with the way in which objects will retain their dipole alignment after a magnetic field is removed, generally referring to objects and phenomena that display physical memory.

Potentials named for their special treatment of this quantity include one named for Jerry Tersoff, and one model named for this quantity suggests that the two outermost layers of a nanoparticle experience the bulk of melting point depression. Stuart's extension of Brenner's potential was intended to better treat this concept. The Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model explains certain phenomena that occur in molecules like Zeise's salt that tend to decrease this quantity. This quantity is limited for late transition metals with oxygen in a phenomenon known as the oxo wall. Pairs of atoms for which this quantity exceeds unity are unlikely to include a bridgehead according to Bredt's rule. This quantity is three-halves for both carbon-oxygen bonds in a carboxylate ion, and rotation is inhibited whenever it's greater than one.

One protein of this family, when complexed with a kinase and contained in the p-TEFb [pee tehf bee] elongation factor, is a cofactor for the HIV-1 protein Tat. One of the “orphan” members of this family is characterized by a forty-residue F-box domain, and the D type is upregulated in the Ras-GTPase pathway and hypophosphorylates retinoblastoma protein. One protein activated by this group of compounds is the serine/threonine kinase p34; that compound binds to the B member of this family of proteins and forms a maturation promoting factor, which controls G2 to M transitions. Named for the periodic variation in their concentration, for 10 points, name this family of proteins that control cell cycle progression and which activate a family of kinases abbreviated cdk.

answer: A {German Requiem}

This work's first cello entrance is a veiled allusion to the hymn ‘They Who Leave All to God” leading the composer to comment later “Oh well, if nobody notices I suppose that's all right too.” The first movement of this work does not use clarinets, piccolos, trumpets, tuba, timpani, and most strikingly violins and that movement ends with the entrance of the harp with the phrase “they that sow in tears.” In the finale the harp reappears, after vanishing since the middle of the second movement, playing its lowest note while the singers are on their highest note. The sixth movement beginning “For here we have no continuing city” ends with a notable fugue drawing from the three note motif that unifies the work, while this work opens with the text, “blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted” rather than the traditional prayers for the dead. Partially inspired by Robert Schumann's suicide attempt this work was written after the death of the composer's mother. For 10 points, name this choral work deriving its text from the Lutheran Bible by Johannes Brahms.

answer: {bounded}

Complex functions are constant wherever they are both analytic and have this property by the Maximum Modulus Principle, while every holomorphic function on the complex plane is constant if it has this property by Liouville's equation. A generalization of this concept is equivalent to requiring that an operator has an operator norm and requires only that f(x) is less than or equal to Mx for some M. A von Neumann algebra is a star-algebra of operators of this type on a Hilbert space, and the axiom of choice is equivalent to requiring every chain with this property to have a maximal element. A subsequence of functions that converges uniformly is given by the Arzela-Ascoli theorem so long as that sequence is equicontinuous and uniformly this, and every sequence with this property has a convergent subsequence by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. A poset with this property has both a least and greatest element, and a Turing machine operates on a finite tape. For 10 points, name this condition, which, by the Heine-Borel theorem, on any subspace of R^n defines compactness together with closure.
