answer: {UV/Visible} spectroscopy [accept either {UV} or {visible}]

In this procedure, a decrease in the energy difference between two frontier orbitals leads to a bathochromic shift, while an increase in that difference leads to a hypsochromic shift. It uses either a split-beam or single-beam spectrophotometer to measure the output and a deuterium arc or tungsten lamp as a spectrum source. It requires the use of a quartz cuvette to hold the sample and is sometimes used as the detector for an HPLC experiment. An exocyclic double bond adds 5 nm while a secondary amine adds 60 nm according to the empirical rules used to predict the results of this technique, which are named for Woodward and Fieser, and this technique is commonly used to image chromophores with large conjugated pi systems. For 10 points, name this type of spectroscopy that uses wavelengths shorter than IR but longer than X-rays.

answer: {Leatherstocking Tales} [accept The {Pioneers} before the first “{series}”]

Billy Kirby kills maple trees to get their sap, and the townspeople waste thousands of fish by letting them rot on the shores of Lake Otsego in the first published book in this series. That novel was only the fourth chronologically; in the third, the protagonist of the series falls in love with Mabel Dunham, only to lose her to Jasper, and in the first, he uses chess pieces found in a chest to help the “daughters” of Thomas Hutter ransom him from the Hurons. That novel, set before The Pathfinder, was criticized for committing 114 out of a possible 115 “offenses against literary art” by Mark Twain. The Pioneers and The Deerslayer are two works in, for 10 points, this series of five novels featuring Natty Bumppo, the second of which is The Last of the Mohicans, written by James Fenimore Cooper?

answer: {dispersion}

One parameter related to this effect is equal to negative lambda over c times the second derivative of n with respect to lambda. Temporal optical solitons are able to propagate because this effect is balanced by the non-linear Kerr effect, and when a pulse travels through a medium that induces an anomalous version of this behavior, it becomes negatively chirped. The Abbe number measures the extent of this phenomenon in transparent materials, which leads to chromatic aberration, and its extent can be determined by the Sellmeier equation. Caused by a variance in the refractive index for difference wavelenghts of light, for 10 points, name this phenomenon in which light divides into different colors when passed through a medium.

answer: cerebellum

Part of this structure is herniated in the Type I Chari malformation, while one population of cells active in it are inhibited by Golgi cells. It is the site of the globus, embelliform, and dentate nuclei, and one type of cells in this organ projects upwards to form a series of parallel fibers in its topmost layer. Complex responses are generated here by inputs from the inferior olives, while more diffuse inputs are provided by mossy fibers. Resting on superior, middle, and inferior peduncles, it contains a granule and molecular layer sandwiching a layer of Purkinje cells. Its divided into a flocconodular lobe, two hemispheres, and a central vermis, and lesions here often cause dysmetria and ataxia. For 10 points, name this structure which is responsible for motor coordination, latin for “little brain”.

This man's arrest corresponded with the appointment of Naevius Sutorius Macro, and this man was betrayed by his subordinate Satrius Secundus near the end of his life. This man's uncle Junius Blaesus put down the rebellion of Tacfarinas. He managed to seduce Livilla into slowly poisoning one of his rivals, and he put down a revolt in Pannonia with the help of future rival Drusus the Younger.

answer: {Sherman} Anti-Trust Act

The case Rice v. Norman Williams Co regarded the ability of this act to invalidate a California law that prohibited liquor import, and it immediately followed the passage of the Valentine Act in its proposer's home state. Violations of this law can be sorted into “per se” and “rule of reason” violations. It was upheld by a case that held that a contract violates this law if it results in undue restraint, known as Standard Oil Company vs. United States. One of its first applications was settling the Pullman Strike, and it was also used to break up the Northern Securities Company and the American Tobacco Company. Named for a senator from Ohio and followed up by an act that targeted price discrimination, for 10 points, name this act followed up by the Clayton Antitrust Act, which restrained monopolies.

answer: {Hungarian Rhapsodies}

The eighth of these is sometimes called “Lento a capriccio”, and Franz Doppler collaborated with their composer to orchestrate six of these. Most of them followed the form of a slow introduction, or lassu, followed by a faster friska section, and the most-famous second one of these, in C sharp minor, included space for the performer to include his or her own cadenza. They inspired a pair of similarly-titled and structured works for violin and piano by Bela Bartok, and the fifteenth of these piano works uses the Racoczy March as its main theme. For 10 points, name this series of nineteen gypsy music-inspired compositions so named for the country of their composer's origin, by Franz Liszt.

Kelly and Schulte differentiated this method from algorithms in that it doesn't lead to certainty, and instead proposed relaxing the restriction that this method has to halt. Riechenbach sorted this method into four different types, including a “cross” variety, and set forth the “straight rule” of it. Sandy Zebell generalized a continuum of these methods devised by Johnson and Carnap, and Carnap himself divided it into direct inference, predictive inference, and three other methods. Hume criticized it for begging the question in the Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, in which he stated it for being probabilistic and lacking the force of reasoning. Nelson Goodman proposed the new riddle of, for 10 points, what epistemological method in which a set of observations about a type of object is generalized to all instances of that object.

answer: {Born}-{Oppenheimer approximation}

A modification of this procedure adds a position term for the center of mass and requires placing the whole system in a potential sphere in order to use the particle in a box method; that procedure is partially named for Huang. The energy calculated in this procedure is a lower bound on the total energy, and the first step of this procedure finds the energy eigenvalue in terms of the position vector R, creating a potential energy surface. A simple application of it is to find the molecular orbitals of an H-two-plus atom, and its second step involves removing the off-diagonal kinetic energy terms, which creates a set of uncoupled motion equations. It states that the one particle only sees the Coloumb potential of another, which removes several terms from an otherwise hairy partial differential equation. For 10 points, name this method which says that nuclear motion can be ignored when modeling a molecule, named for two guys.

Carmichael proved that large ones of these do not share prime factors with other ones, and Wall-Sun-Sun primes are necessarily these. Matiyasevich's disproof of Hilbert's tenth problem relied on these values to show that Diophantine equations have solutions that can grow exponentially, and a pair of them give the Euclidean algorithm its worst-case runtime. Their generating function is x divided by 1 minus x minus x squared, and every positive integer can be written as the sum of non-consecutive ones of these according to Zeckendorf's theorem. The Lucas numbers obey a similar rule as them, and one formula for generating them relies on the Golden Ratio, known as Binet's formula.

Tombstone diagrams were originally created to describe these programs, which are the subject of a classic textbook by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman. Static type checking is often employed by these programs, and several methods for optimizing these programs rely on use-define chains and include jump threading, strength reduction, and loop optimization. A call graph is created during the execution of these programs, and a common instance of Byzantine faulting occurs when syntatic information gets out of phase with one component of these programs. The just-in-time variety operates during runtime, and these programs perform lexical analysis and parsing, followed by code generation. For 10 points, name these programs that transform source code from a high-level language into a lower-level language, used to create executables.
