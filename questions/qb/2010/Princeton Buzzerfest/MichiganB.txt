Josephine Ford's seduction of him leads that character to eventually destroy the titular flute. Another novel by this author sees the protagonist quickly become attached to the older and married Clara Dawes and at the end of the novel, Gertrude Morel dies. In another novel by this author of The Plumed Serpant and the “Odour of Chrysanthemums,” the titular character's husband had a crippling injury causing him to use a motorized wheelchair, sexually frustrating Connie.

answer: Treaty of {Trianon}

Negotiations for this treaty began in the aftermath of the war caused by the Social Democrat government's refusal to accept the terms of the Vix Note. Instead of agreeing, that government ceded power to a party organized in a Moscow hotel just after the after the Aster Revolution, which was in turn was overthrown after losing the war with its eastern neighbor. The victors helped establish an Anti-Communist government which was still barely privy to the discussions that would remove five of its ten largest cities. Territorial losses from this treaty were somewhat recovered via two Vienna awards in 1939 and 1940 and the Munich Conference. Territories such as Vojvodina, Carpathian Ruthenia, and Transylvania were separated from the losing country, even though those territories had substantial Magyar populations.  For 10 points, name this treaty signed in 1920 between the Allies and Hungary, which stripped it of almost three-quarters of its territory.

answer: {auxins}

One model for the long distance transport of these substances sees uptake by passive diffusion in a protonated form and export actively in a dissociated anion form by PIN proteins, in the polar transport model. These substances is generally thought be derived through some combination of transamination and oxidative decarboxylation from tryptophan. Experiments with coleoptiles showed that these substances decreased the pH of the growth substrate, which along with the uptake of water is thought to cause one of their major functions. High concentrations of these substances can cause bent tissue, as well as the formation of adventitious roots. They also inhibit growth in lateral buds to reduce competition with the apical meristem and are involved in gravitropism and phototropism. These hormones are most famous for causing cell elongation. For 10 points, name these plant hormones that include IAA.

The second emperor of this dynasty conquered Wú Yuè before capturing Tài yuán to end the Northern Hàn dynasty.The Chinese first used paper money and Zh? X? founded Neo-Confucianism during this dynasty, which also featured the first extensive use of the Imperial civil service to pick qualified bureaucrats and the reform minded chancellor Wáng ?nshí. Originally troubled by the Khitans under the Liáo, the Jurchens soon proved to be a much greater threat.

answer: {Robber's Cave} experiment [or {study} or some other equivalent]

It was divided into three stages, the second of which had to be cut short due to in part to the stealing of others' property. This experiment's third stage introduced other goals, such as a shortage of drinking water, which were meant to decrease the amount of conflict between the two groups, who named themselves “The Rattlers” and “The Eagles.” Its subjects were 24 twelve-year-old boys, who established social rankings in their groups within the first few days of the experiment. In a paper written about it, the authors postulate that a person receives more gratification when his techniques or tools are used to reach the goals of a group rather than personal ones; that paper is “Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation.” Muzafer and Carolyn Sherif conducted, for 10 points, what experiment which took place in the titular state park in Oklahoma?

answer: {Riemann zeta} function

This function can be expanded around 1 into a Laurent series whose constant coefficients are the Stieltjes constants. Zipf's law uses this function to determine the frequency of words over an infinite language. Though it converges at 0, it diverges at 1 due to the divergence of the Harmonic Series. The study of this function is often focused on the Z-Function, which is restricted to the critical line. Hardy showed that this function has infinitely number of zeroes on the critical line, but the distribution of these solutions are still open in the hypothesis that the all non-trivial zeroes of this function have a real part equal to ½. For ten points, identify this function named for a German mathematician.

answer: {Haymarket} riot [accept anything implying a disturbance]

The night before this event, a proposed leaflet commanding one group to “appear in full force” and with “arms” was rejected. During that same night, a plan to retaliate with simultaneous bombing was discussed. That night was called the “Monday Night Conspiracy.” Most of the casualties on one side were due to friendly-fire in the dark and those people died after Samuel Fielden finished a speech at 10:30 PM. Louis Lingg was one person convicted for causing this event and he survived six hours after a smuggled cigar-shaped dynamite cap blew his face off.  Judge Joseph Gary sentenced Albert Parson, George Engel, and August Spies to hangings for their parts in this event, which also saw the death of Mathias Degan.

answer: {fugacity} [prompt on ''{f}'' before it is mentioned]

For a dense fluid at high pressure, pressure affects this quantity, necessitating an exponential integral called the Poynting factor to correct it. At the same phase, temperature, and pressure, this quantity is equal in pure solutions and ideal solutions according to the Lewis-Randall rule. It also simplifies the calculation of chemical potential of a non-ideal gas to an ideal potential plus the natural log of the ratio between this and standard pressure times RT. In non-ideal gases, this quantity is equal to a coefficient, symbolized phi, multiplied by pressure, but in ideal gases it equals pressure. For 10 points, name this quantity with units of pressure that is defined as the tendency of a substance to escape from its current phase, symbolized by f.

When depicted in art, this figure was often paired with a hoop or a rooster, a gift from his most famous lover. Some sources postulate that his father was not the son of Erichthonius of Dardania, but rather Laomedon, making this figure the brother of Tithonus and Priam. It is usually agreed, however, that he was the son of Tros, who was given a golden vine and two divine horses for his mourning. One variant of the popular story involving him includes Eos abducting Tithonus and him and both obtaining eternal life, but Tithonus was unfortunate and did not receive eternal youth. The more popular variant, however, is that he was on Mount Ida when he was abducted by an eagle and taken to Mount Olympus, where he replaced Hebe. For 10 points, name this youth from Greek mythology whose beauty was so pure that he was chosen by Zeus to be a cupbearer for the gods.

answer: {conservation} laws [accept {conservation} of {baryon number} in the first {two} sentences]

The reason that the sigma star plus particle doesn't decay into a proton and a neutrino is due to one of these proposed by Heisenberg. That one only applies in strong interactions and was made to explain the similarities between the neutron and proton. Another one of these is due to the fact that phase shift of a wavefunction can't be observed, while a different one of these must exist due to the invariance of the Lagrangian to position. With any given symmetry, a corresponding one of these exists according to Noether's theorem, yet another one of these applies when there is no external torque. Inelastic collisions require two of these for motion calculation, while elastic collisions require only one. Important ones include ones for angular momentum, linear momentum, energy, and charge. For 10 points, name these laws that say that certain quantities remains constant in a system.

During one failed expedition, this man, on the advice of a woman named Timo, attempted to sneak into a city via a sanctuary to the goddess Kore and her mother. That incident happened during the siege of Paros. Earlier in his life, he conquered Lemnos after local Thracian tribes had made this man the tyrant of Chersonese. This man was tried for the Paros expedition and fined 50 talents, but died before he was able to pay that fine. That fine was paid by his son who defeated over 200 Phoenician ships at Eurymedon and was named Cimon. Although originally imprisoned for being a tyrant, this man's involvement in the Ionian Revolt against the Persians allowed him to be elected strategoi in 490BC. He also succeeded in convincing five other strategoi and Callimachus to attack the Persians directly instead of waiting for the Spartans. For 10 points, name this general who commanded the Greek forces at Marathon.
