answer: titration

One method of this uses an alcohol, imidazole, sulfur dioxide and iodine in a reaction that uses a current supplied by platinum electrodes to drive it; that version is named for Karl Fischer and is used to detect water. One way of obtaining the result of this approach often uses a thermistor to measure the “breakpoint” when the rate of the change of temperature hits an inflection point; that method is the thermometric method. A more common approach examines a namesake curve after a substance like phenolphthalein has been used. After the equivalence point is reached, this method's endpoint is where the chosen measure has an inflection point; this measure is commonly electric potential or pH. For 10 points, what is this chemical technique that determines the concentration of an unknown substance in a sample.

answer: {uncertainty} principle [do not accept “{Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle}”]

In special relativity, such a relationship exists between energy and time as a result of the Robertson–Schrödinger relation. In harmonic analysis, viewing a function and its Fourier transform as conjugate variables on the time-frequency domain will result in the inequality that the infinite integral of the squares of the time and position of the function multiplied by that of its Fourier transform is greater than 1 over 16 pi squared, resulting in a formalized statement of this principle. The most famous version of this principle results when one notes that the wave functions of the momentum and position are Fourier transform pairs, resulting in serious complications in experimentation at the particle level. For 10 points, what is this physical principle whose quantum analog was formulated by a student of Niels Bohr in 1926?

Kings Mindaugas II and Charles I came to the thrones of their countries as a result of this agreement. One of the side-effects of this was repulsed by the “Miracle of the Vistula”, and finally resolved by the Treaty of Riga, while an indirect result of this was the defeat of the Red Guards at Tampere, as one group was unable to provide direct support to one side of the Finnish Civil War, although they were able to fight the Polish-Soviet War.

The first of the earlier attempts is rejected as only an example of the central concept, and the namesake “dilemma” of this work is brought up in response to the title character's definition of the central concept, which another character questions, using the example that something that is “carried” is called such just because it is being carried.

Masubi and Amirani are two notable features of this object; those are dust varieties, in contrast with Tvashtar, which some times termed a stealth one. Laplace created a theory to explain its orbital resonance with two other similar objects, and Pioneer 11 discovered a strong belt of radiation from a larger nearby object that completely envelopes this one. This object's orbit is extremely elliptical in nature, due to its orbital resonance with two other moons of its planet, which creates extreme fluctuations in the crust of this moon, therefore generating an extreme amount of internal heat, which manifests itself in violent ejections of sulfur and sulfur dioxide. For 10 points, what is this moon, the most geologically active object in the Solar System, and the innermost Galilean moon of Jupiter?

She is praised in the First Epistle of Peter for her obedience.

Her husband attempted to smuggle her into Egypt by hiding her in a chest, but she was caught at the border inspection. Luckily, she was beautiful enough to enamor the pharaoh, convincing him that her husband was actually her brother. As a gift, the pharaoh gave his daughter to her as a slave; that slave would later become her rival.

Before the birth of that son, her husband had fathered Ishmael with her slave Hagar. For 10 points, name this woman from the Book of Genesis, the mother of Isaac and the wife of Abraham.

The flagship of the task force led by Aubrey Fitch was sunk after this battle because gasoline vapors released by a torpedo strike ignited into a fire that prevented salvage. The flagship of Frank Fletcher, which had just come from contesting the invasion of Tulagi, also suffered major damage. Weather conditions had alternately provided both sides with cover from aerial attack, though one beneficiary of the cover still lost enough planes that it had to withdraw from the theater, along with another heavily damaged carrier. Though damage to Fletcher's ship was so severe that the Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue was informed it had been sunk, repairs were made that allowed the aircraft of the Yorktown to play a crucial role a month later. The Lexington was lost, while the effective disablement of the Zuikaku and Shokaku kept them out of the Battle of Midway.
