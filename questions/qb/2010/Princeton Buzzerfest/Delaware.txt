answer: {Rubisco} [or {ribulose}-{1,5}-{bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase}]

The ion that allows this compound to perform its primary function binds to a lysine in a pH-dependent fashion, forming a carbamate. The concentration of magnesium-two-plus cations is increased by light where this compound operates. Light also helps its namesake activase promote the binding of its substrate to carbamated active sites, and the release of a compound that, when bound, prevents trypsin-catalyzed breakdown and blocks active sites, CA1P. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction whose primary products are a highly unstable 6-carbon molecule in the presence of carbon dioxide, and phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphoglycerate in the presence of oxygen. The most abundant protein on Earth, this is, for 10 points, what enzyme that is responsible for fixing carbon dioxide to ribulose in the first stage of the Calvin cycle?

answer: The {Sun Also Rises}

One character in this novel stops speaking to the protagonist after he introduces a nineteen-year-old to the main female figure; that nineteen-year-old manages to fend of the attack of another figure when he discovers them together (in contrast to the protagonist, who is knocked out), and Pedro Romero refuses to shake his hand afterwards. That man in this work took up boxing to deal with the problems of being a Jew at Princeton, and both him and the protagonist fail to sustain relationships with the main female figure, although Robert Cohn remains strongly attached, and the protagonist never really gets started, since Lady Brett Ashley desires a sexual relationship. For 10 points, what is this novel that stars the disaffected and impotent World War I veteran Jake Barnes, by Ernest Hemingway?

answer: {Stern}-{Gerlach} experiment

Five years after it was first performed, Phipps and Taylor re-ran this experiment using hydrogen and got the same result. A modification of the device used in this experiment was used to show that state transitions in magnetic momentum could be induced using time-varying fields; that change is an oscillation named for I.I. Rabi and is used in MRIs. The purpose of this experiment was to test competing theories proposed by Larmor and Sommerfeld. Conducted by two of Niels Bohr's associates, this experiment showed that a beam of silver atoms shot through a magnetic field splits as a result of the intrinsic angular moment of the atoms. This is, for 10 points, what doubly-eponymous experiment which proved that atoms and electrons have quantized spin?

answer: {Black Hole} of {Calcutta} [or {Black Hole} of {Kolkata}]

A monument commemorating this was built in Dalhousie Square, although after it attracted political controversy, it was moved to St. John's Church. This event was preceded by the capture of a silkworm factory at Kasimbazar and governor Roger Drake's retreat from Fort William. Roger Clive eventually rescued many of the survivors; one of them, John Holwell, claimed that 123 people died, although later counts showed it was at most 43 people, all of whom had been imprisoned by the forces of Siraj-ad-Daula, the Nawab of Bengal. This is, for 10 points, what June 20th, 1756 incident in which many British prisoners were suffocated after being locked overnight in a small room?

answer: {Swan Lake}

Most productions of this work are based on the revival choreographed by Petipa and Ivanov, with a score altered by Riccardo Drigo, although the original choreography was done by Julius Reisinger. The two leading roles in this ballet are usually played by a single dancer, for which a pas de deux named for its composer was created as a variation on the pas de six that served as the third act's Grand Pas. The titular location is formed from the tears shed by the protagonist's parents after she is kidnapped by the evil sorcerer, von Rothbart, and turned into the titular animal. Von Rothbart's death turns Odete back into a human at the climax of, for 10 points, what ballet by Peter Tchiakovsky?

In one novel by this writer, the protagonist kills a gardener who she had supposedly been falling in love with when Saburo tries to act on Etsuko's feelings, and in another work, the formerly retired Noguchi struggles with the efforts of his wealthy wife Kazu to win him an election, preferring to win on his own. In addition to Thirst for Love and After the Banquet, he wrote a short story in which the title principle is demonstrated by the protagonist, who kills himself rather than fight against the Emperor, “Patriotism”, and a novel in which Mizoguchi fails to kill himself after starting a fire in the titular structure.

The Holmec Incident, in which JNA troops were supposedly killed while attempting to surrender, occurred during this country's war of independence of a namesake length. At the end of the Ten-Day War, this country signed the Brioni Agreement. The Julian Alps, Kamnik-Savinja Alps, and the Karavanke chain can be found in this country, which also has a region that gives its name to a type of topography, the Kras Plateau. This country contains part of the Drava River, a tributary of the Danube, on which the largest city in the country's region of Lower Styria lies. That city is also home to this country's second largest airport, Maribor Airport. It recently joined the European Union, becoming, in 2008, the first ex-Communist country to hold the Presidency of the Council of that body. This is, for 10 points, what Slavic nation that was formerly a part of Yugoslavia, and whose capital is at Ljubljana?

answer: {Neoptolemus} [accept {Pyrrhus}]

While king of Epirus, he arbitrated the dispute between Odysseus and the families of the suitors of Penelope, and regained control of Phthia from Acastus after his grandfather was exiled. In Epirus he abducted Lanassa, a granddaughter of Hercules and fathered eight children with her. His children Molossus, Pielus, and Pergamus were fathered with his prize Andromache after the fall of Troy, but his later desire for the hand of Hermione led to war with Orestes, who eventually killed him in the temple of Delphi. During the Trojan War, he journeyed with Odysseus to Lemnos to retrieve Philoctetes, and killed Priam in the temple of Zeus. After arriving at Troy, he was presented with the armor of his father, which Ajax had killed himself over after losing a contest to Odysseus. For 10 points, name this man conceived while his father posed as a girl at the court of King Lycomedes, the son of Achilles.

answer: Laurence {Sterne}

The complaints of Francis Topham over not receiving appointments to some ecclesiastical courts provoked one of this author's works, a satire which depicts Topham as "Trim" seeking more than his "watch-coat." In addition to A Political Romance, this author also wrote a work in which the protagonist allows a count to believe that he is the king's jester in Hamlet, allowing him to procure a passport to avoid arrest in a foreign country. This author wrote another novel with a character named Yorick, which does not discuss the birth of the title character until the fourth of nine volumes that make it up, and that title character is misnamed when Susannah is unable to tell Parson Yorick his intended name, leading to great disappointment for Walter, although Trim and Uncle Toby put less importance on it. For 10 points, name this English author of A Sentimental Journey and Tristram Shandy?

answer: {ferrofluid}

One use of these compounds takes advantage of its obeying of Curie's Law, using a magnet to attract colder substance towards a voice coil and forcing away the warmer substance. Aside from their physical properties of high conductance and extremely low friction, assisted by their nanometer scale particles of an ore of its namesake or a similar paramagnetic compound coated in a surfactant and suspended in water or oil, these substances may be better known for their aesthetic appearance. Numerous "moving sculptures" have been created by exploiting this liquid's tendency to form solid spikes in the presence of a magnetic field. For 10 points, identify this type of revolutionary colloid, named for its most abundant ingredient, iron.

During his reign, his polity's forces won the Battle of Watling Street, crushing a revolt that had already sacked present-day Colchester and London. Another revolt against him was nearly busted by the efforts of one woman to recruit sailors to the cause; she strangled herself rather than reveal her co-conspirators under torture. He sent Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo to negotiate peace with the Parthian Empire, although he would eventually order Corbulo and two of his own advisors to commit suicide, Petronius and Seneca. This man also appointed a future emperor to put down a revolt in Judea; he would use the same forces to eventually accede to the throne after a year of chaos. Succeeded by Galba after his suicide triggered the Year of Four Emperors, this is, for 10 points, what nephew of Claudius, a Roman Emperor who probably didn't fiddle while Rome burned?

This work ends with a quote from Genesis 19:17 by telling listeners to “escape for your lives, look not behind you, escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed,” while the epigraph to this work is a quotation from Deuteronomy 32:35, “Their foot shall slide in due time.” This work cites Luke 12 and Psalm 73 multiple times, and praises the people of Suffield for their faith. It states that "Divine justice never stands in the way" and consists of several "considerations" in claiming that "there is nothing that keeps wicked men at any one moment out of hell, but the mere pleasure of God." First delivered in Enfield, Connecticut, this work claims that men are like a spider, held over the pit of hell. This is, for 10 points, what Great Awakening sermon by Jonathan Edwards?

In one novel by this author, the protagonist's friend Brian commits suicide, and Mark loses a leg on an adventure, as Anthony eventually becomes a pacifist. Mary and Mark Rampion serve as the moral compass in another one of his works as a happily married couple, in contrast to the infidelity of Marjorie Carling with her lover Walter Bidlake. In addition to writing Antic Hay and Eyeless in Gaza, this author advocated the use of LSD, depicting its religious use in Island, in contrast to the use of a fictional drug with similar effects in his most famous work.

The IBEX probe, using energetic neutral atom imaging, has challenged the traditional idea of the shape of this space. The largest structure within it is the rippling current sheet, which can be modeled by the Ballerina model, and is created by the changing magnetic field of the Sun. Within most of it, the solar wind travels at supersonic speed and only slows to subsonic speeds, due to the balancing of the solar wind with the pressure of the interstellar medium, at the termination shock. The Voyagers are both outside of the termination shock, but are both still inside the bow shock, where this space ends. For ten points, what is this "bubble" in space defined by the boundary between the solar wind and interstellar medium?

answer: The {Luncheon} on the {Grass} [or Le {déjeuner sur l'herbe}]

This painting which Emile Zola described as a “vast ensemble, full of atmosphere,” is currently on display at the Museé d'Orsay in Paris. The depicted environment seems to be a small, shady grove with a small pond in the background. A woman in a white chemise emerges from that pond and bends over, while a man seated in the foreground gestures toward another man, who seems to be staring off into a space behind the viewer. The fancy and overdressed state of the two men starkly contrasts the nudity of the third figure in the foreground, who seems to pay little attention to them. For 10 points, name this painting which shocked audiences with its nonchalant depiction of the nude female form when it was exhibited at the Salon des Refusés, one of the most influential works of Edouard Manet.

By the end of this battle, the height of one hill had been lowered by 4 meters, rendering its name inaccurate. Assaults against Côte 304 and the hills of Le Mort Homme were successful, and allowed the attackers to shift their focus to the right bank of the river and further gains. Those gains were eventually surrendered in November, preceding the defenders' recapture of Fort Douaumont, near which a prior defense by the 33rd Infantry Regiment had allowed the safe passage of massive quantities of materiel by trucks on the “Voie Sacree”, or “Sacred Road.” During that action company commander Charles De Gaulle was captured. In choosing the battle site, Erich von Falkenhayn, believed the French would attempt an absolute defense of the historically significant surrounding forts, though he expected the toll of casualties to weigh in the Germans' favor. Name, for 10 points, this battle fought in 1916 during World War I in which the Germans attempted to “bleed the French white.”

He published a number of scientific papers on hydroids, and discovered several new species of Hydrozoa. He was named an honorary field marshal of the British army, and named a Knight of the Order of Garter, although these honors were revoked, then later restored. He became regent after his father Taisho became ill, and his death marked the start of the Heisei period. On becoming Emperor, he decided to call his regnal period the Showa era, meaning "peace and enlightenment," but this name was turned into a bad joke by events like the Mukden incident and the Second Sino-Japanese War, as well as the actions of his prime minister Hideki Tojo. This is, for 10 points, what Emperor of Japan during World War II?
