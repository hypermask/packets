answer: the {morning star} [or {day star}]

The Qur'an gives its name as tariq which in the Sufi tradition means “deliverer of messages”. In Norse mythology, it is called Aurvandil because Aurvandil's wife Groa cured Thor of a horn stuck in his head. To reward her, Thor took Aurvandil's toe which had frozen off and cast it into the heavens where it became this. In Old English the name is rendered Earendel and was also apparently a deity conflated with Christ in the Exeter Book. In Greek mythology, it refers to Eosphorus, a son of Eos, who is scientifically the same object as his nocturnal twin Hesperus. Eosphorus, Hesperus, and their Latin equivalent are all used to translate the name of Helel, a proud Babylonian king in the Bible, by ancient translators, causing confusion with a more important Biblical character also bearing this name. For 10 points, what is this celestial object associated with the Devil in Christian demonology?

answer: Herman {Hesse}

In one short story by this author, the protagonist is shown the ravages of war by a dark bird to demonstrate the true evils of the world. That boy's quest for flowers for the burial of the dead is ultimately successful in “Strange News from Another Star”, the title story in a collection by this writer. In contrast, the protagonist of another work fails, along with the other members of The League, in the title quest after the disappearance of Leo, and the protagonist of yet another novel drowns in a river after being expelled from a seminary, as Hans Giebenrath, despite his education, failed to develop personally. In addition to Journey to the East and Beneath the Wheel, this writer also wrote novels in which the high-born title character ends up as a ferryman, and Hermine teaches Harry Haller to dance. For 10 points, identify this German author of Siddhartha and Steppenwolf.

answer: {tryptophan}

Regulatory T cells use CTLA-4 to breakdown this compound, and expression of IDO is needed to start the breakdown of it into kynurenine to prevent fetus rejection in mice. The first step of one synthesis of this compound involves the conversion of glutamine to glutamate (with pyruvate as a byproduct), as chorismate is converted to anthranilate. This compound can be converted into a neurotransmitter with the help of a namesake hydroxylase, and then, with the help of pyridoxal 5-phosphate, decarboxylated into serotonin. This compound shares a property with methionine, as the only other nondegenerate amino acid. What is this amino acid, whose indole side chain features, for 10 points, a benzene ring adjacent to a nitrogen-containing pyrrole, synthesized with a namesake operon and abbreviated W?

One work by this composer features fast circular flute patterns, high piano, and bell figurations and demonstrates the composers influence from Balinese gamelan music. In addition to The Prince of the Pagodas, another work starts with bells and a chantlike chorus and features the use of the tritone as a unifying device. Another work's third movement begins in a ABA form and the violins begin the sentimental theme over a G pedal in the cellos and basses and is in the form of a saraband. Yet another work spotlights each instrument in the orchestra and is subtitled Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Purcell. He is also known for operas such as Peter Grimes. For 10 points, name this English composer most famous for his War Requiem, Simple Symphony, and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra.

One man of this name defeated an army of Etruscans and Gauls at Volterra. The name comes from an Indo-European word for to cut, and in Latin denoted a staff of formal governmental authority.  Another was found dead after offending a crowd with his opinion on the justice of the deaths of his brothers-in-law.  He was given the command that earned him his own unique agnomen by asserting influence over the natives in the province his grandfather had ruled 60 years previously. Another man saved his own father's life by charging an encircling force at the Battle of Ticinus. After the defeat at the Battle of the Upper Baetis, that man won appointment to command an army, with which he won the Battle of Illipa, and gained control of Hispania for Rome.

One of this man's theories claims that judgements, which form the basis of knowledge, are reached by determining the existence of a presented object. One of his students wrote a work claiming that the essence of music was consonance, Questions of Music, while another wrote a book whose first volume, Prolegomena to Pure Logic, is a strong attack on psychologism. In addition to his theory of judgement advanced in Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint, another one of his theories sought to distinguish a mental kind of action from a physical one by claiming that mental phenomenons had an object at which they are directed, a claim expanded on by his student's work Logical Investigations. For 10 points, who is this man who taught Carl Stumpf and Edmund Husserl and introduced the concept of intentionality in his Descriptive Psychology, a German philosopher.

The cuckoo type of this structure can be implemented using bipartite matching algorithms. To improve the expected bounds into a worst case bound, its universal formulation can use randomization over a series of 2-way independent functions to reduce collisions with high probability. Having no collisions results in a perfect type of this data structure. Knuth and others credit H.P. Luhn with its creation, though Open Addressing and other related techniques were already known at the time. Though Knuth conducted a famous analysis of the linear probing version, the chaining version has more practical bounds on adversarial input, but the double version can improve upon linear probing. For 10 points, what is this symbol table data structure that achieves O(1) operations using a function to map keys to memory addresses?

answer: {Eightfold Way}

This theory derives from the isospin symmetry of nuclear interactions, with particle multiplets first identified as representations of the special unitary group of the third degree. This system resulted after the introduction of the quantum number for strangeness, S, which accounted for particles which are produced strongly but decay weakly in that only strong interactions conserved S. Since the strong nuclear force is the same for quarks of any flavor, symmetry results. Particles along the same line in this representation share the same value of S while those upon the same diagonal share the same charge, and in this system, a decuplet is generally represented as a triangle, and an octet as an octagon. For 10 points, what is this theory for organizing baryons and mesons proposed by Yuval Ne'eman and Murray Gell-Mann and named for a concept in Buddhism?

One proof of it proved the strict neutrality lemma whereby all binary social rankings are made the same way; that proof was published by John Geankopolos. Two possible solutions to this paradox include finding some sort of commonality amongst individual preferences, or determining single-peakedness, if there is any; these solutions were advanced by Duncan Black. The theorem itself can be constructed under assumptions which include independence of irrelevant alternatives, monotonicity, and citizen sovereignty, the latter two of which may be substituted with an assumption of Pareto efficiency. For 10 points, name this eponymous economic theory that demonstrates the failure of voting systems based on individual preference to construct a social preference.

The formulator of this idea rejected the shifting balance theory, instead stating that geographic isolation was required for speciation, and that this idea along with gene loss and small population size could accelerate speciation. One consequence of this is the high incidence of Huntington's disease among descendants of the original Afrikaners in South Africa. One version of it can be used to explain progressive decreases in genetic diversity as humans migrated from Africa, the serial version. This can also be more generally depicted, if the population increases, as a bottleneck. An extreme example of genetic drift, for 10 points, name this effect, formulated by Ernst Mayr, that results when a new population is started by a sample not representative of the larger parent population.

Among the first challenges faced by his reign was a child-eating fox sent by Dionysus that could outrun all dogs. He purified Amphitryon and Alcmena for the death of Electryon, and later gave his daughter in marriage to their son. That daughter, Megara, was unfortunately married to Hercules, who later killed her in a fit of rage. During his second reign, his son Menoeceus committed suicide in order to save their city. As a consequence of a decree he made regarding treatment of enemies, war broke out between his city and Athens, at the end of which he was killed by Theseus. As another consequence of that decree, his son's fiancée, son, and wife all committed suicide in succession. Most of his problems began when he unknowingly married his sister Jocasta off to her son after the death of the Sphinx.

One of the title characters of this work is described as someone who has “belonged to any and every league that had been founded for almost any purpose whatsoever.” This character, supposedly inspired by Elizabeth Peabody, suspects her doctor of “dissecting”, although she still introduces Dr. Mary Prance to the male protagonist. Despite the desires of Miss Birdseye, he becomes attracted to another character after listening to her speak, even though he is strongly opposed to the actual contents of Verena Tarrant's speech. Despite the efforts of Verena's mentor, also his cousin, to win her allegiance to their movement and get her to renounce marriage, the novel ends with Verena's elopement with him.

Because one side was celebrating its commander's twenty-fifth birthday the night before this battle, the other side attempted a night attack but was forced to abandon its plans and retreat because of the imminent dawn. As a result of this, the losing side was exhausted, and George Murray's shift of the right wing of that side proved unheeded by the Duke of Perth and others, leaving the lines severely stretched. The commander of the government forces had arrived a few months before this battle after the previous blunders of Cope and Hawley that failed to quell the conflict. A combination of the government forces' superior artillery and the marshy and uneven terrain made the famed Highland charge much less effective.
