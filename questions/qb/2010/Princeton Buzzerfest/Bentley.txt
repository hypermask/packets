answer: Janus

Dupuis traced the characteristics of St. Peter back to the ancient mythology of this deity, including both figures' associations with a rod. A temple devoted to this deity in Argiletum has his hands pointed in a position some say maybe represents the number 355, and he was once associated with Ani. This deity claimed that he used to be called Chaos because he was "of the first world", and in one story, he successfully pursues Cardea. Sometimes called Clusius or Patulcius in ancient times, he was said to have caused a volcanic eruption to prevent retribution for the Rape of the Sabine Women. Celebrated by Ovid as "the only god who is able to see behind him", the doors to his temple were probably kept open during times of war.

answer: {solar flares} [or {stellar flares}]

An important model for these objects was proposed by Heyvaerts, Priest and Rust in the mid-70s, while they were first observed by Richard Carrington in 1859. These entities are studied by the Max Millennium Program, which partially analyzes the particle acceleration in them. Entities sometimes classified as the more general type of them include Wolf 359 and UV Ceti. These events have been studied by the GOES and Yohkoh missions, while gamma rays they produce were first imaged by the RHESSI Mission. Weak ones are given the classification "B", while powerful ones have included an X5 that triggered the Bastille Day event, a fifteen-minute-long geomagnetic storm. When the matter in these objects is heated above 10 million Kelvin, coronal mass ejections may occur. For 10 points, name these violent eruptions in the sun's atmosphere.

Path finding problems containing differential constraints and obstacles can be solved efficiently with the rapidly-exploring random type of these data structures. Two-dimensional problems can be solved with the polygonal map or point region flavors of a certain type of these objects, while Arne Andersson lends his initials to a type of these that are similar to the 2-3 ["two three"] type. Another type of these can perform insert and delete operations in big O of n log n time by enforcing rules on the color of nodes. A popular form of these was invented by Rudolf Bayer and is often used for implementing databases; this is the B variety. Self-balancing forms of a particular type of these data structures are exemplified in the AVL and red-black types. For 10 points, name this data structure which also comes in a binary search type.
