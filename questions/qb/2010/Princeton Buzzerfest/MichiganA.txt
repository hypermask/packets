This thinker focused on contemporary depictions of war in Regarding the Pain of Others; that work built upon an earlier essay collection which compared the work of Diane Arbus to images documenting the Great Depression, On Photography. This author wrote a short story about the responses of several New Yorkers when one of their friends develops AIDS, entitled "The Way We Live Now."  She is better known for an essay which states that "the whole point of" the titular phenomenon "is to dethrone the serious," and declares its ultimate statement is "it's good because it's awful." In addition to "Notes on 'Camp'," she wrote about the psychological damage caused by myths surrounding tuberculosis and cancer. For 10 points, name this author of Illness as Metaphor and Against Interpretation.

Loki and Heimdall fought each other in the form of these creatures in the ocean, while a group of people evolve into human-like forms of these creatures after shipwrecking in Kurt Vonnegut's Galapagos. Lake Ladoga is home to a ringed variety of this species of animal, while the Nerpa ones are unique to Lake Baikal. The daughter of the Inuit creator god is most closely associated with these animals, and in one story Sedna's severed fingers became whales, walruses, and these creatures. In Celtic myth, Selkies could transform from these into humans on land and transformed back by reattaching their skins. For 10 points, name this cute aquatic mammal that is often snacked upon by killer whales and clubbed to death and eaten as a delicacy by Canadians.

answer: Republic of {Zimbabwe} [prompt on "{Rhodesia}" before mentioned]

The last-resort Operation Quartz was called off after this country's final independence, as the leader of the group who would have perpetrated the coup after one party's outright victory in elections asked for calm. Earlier, UN Security Council Resolution 216 had condemned this country's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, condemning it as "made by a racist minority." A government led by Margaret Thatcher briefly retook control of this nation, after which the Lancaster House Agreement was negotiated. Its first two Prime Ministers were Ian Smith and Abel Muzorewa. Currently led by a coalition between ZANU-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, for 10 points, what is this African country, formerly known as Southern Rhodesia, that has been led for the last 30 years by Robert Mugabe?

answer: {Temptation} of Saint {Anthony} [accept {plural} forms]

In one version of this painting, a merman with two tails rides a fish and carries another in the top left corner, next to a winged fish with a boat on its back. Also in that triptych, a skull-headed creature plays a harp while riding a fictional mount in front of the central platform, which in turn is in front of a ruined tower. In another version, the title figure clad in blue lies prone as he is assaulted by various anthropomorhic creatures, and a lizard bites at his hand. That scene forms the rightmost panel of a famous altarpiece, and a more modern version of this scene depicts the nude title figure holding up a wooden cross against various animals with very long legs, including an elephant with a nude woman on a platform on top and a rearing white horse. Paintings by Hieronymus Bosch, a panel of the Isenheim Altarpiece by Matthias Grünewald, and a painting by Salvador Dali all depict, for 10 points, what scene of the trials of the title saint in the Egyptian desert?

In the first step of flavonoid synthesis, one of these is added to 4-coumarate, and one of these is replaced with an amino acid in the final step of bile salt synthesis. One is removed from another molecule in an irreversible step in synthesis of cholesterol, the production of mevalonate. One intermediate in its synthesis is the condensation of cysteine with 4'-PPA, which occurs after the phosphorylation of pantothenic acid, or vitamin B5. The reactive group of this molecule is a thiol, and in the step of the Krebs cycle that produces GTP, it is detached from succinate. For 10 points, name this molecule which is used in the transport of fatty acids and, when combined with an acetyl group, forms an input to the Krebs cycle.

answer: {Pryderi}

This figure, the husband of Cifga, was once tricked into trading a herd of pigs for twelve enchanted mushrooms; in the war that ensued, he was killed by a son of Don. Along with Manawydan, he successively took up saddlery, shieldmaking, and shoemaking, but each time was driven off by angry Englishmen for being too good at his trade. This figure's foster-father, Teyrnon, originally named him Gwri for his golden hair. While hunting a white boar, this hero entered a magic castle, where he touched a golden bowl and instantly became stuck. Shortly after being born, this hero disappeared, causing his mother's handmaidens to smear her mouth with a puppy's blood and claim she had eaten the baby. For 10 points, identify this son of Pwyll and Rhiannon, who appears in all four branches of the Mabinogion.

answer: ethers

Molecules of this type are often made using an alumina catalyst, but a side product of an alkene is also produced in that process. Jain and Pillai found that when phenol is added to that reacting system, the rate of alkene production is greatly increased, while the rate of production of these is reduced drastically. When an aldehyde is placed in an acidic alcohol solution an acetal is often formed, which contains two of this functional group. One common synthesis of one of these uses an SN2 mechanism in which an alkoxide attacks an alkyl halide, named after Williamson, and due to their low reactivity they are used as solvents in the Grignard reaction. For 10 points, name this functional group which consists of an oxygen single-bonded to two carbon atoms.

answer: Augustin-Louis {Cauchy}

The general case of Fermat's conjecture that all positive integers are the sum of at most three triangular numbers, four square numbers, and so on was proved by this man. He found the first general proof that the Euler characteristic of vertices - edges + faces for a convex polyhedron is 2. The first to rigorously prove Taylor's theorem, his namesake remainder applies to Taylor series, and a more general form of the Navier-Stokes equations is his momentum equation. He found that if a function is holomorphic along two different paths between points, the path integrals will be the same in his namesake integral theorem. He also found a special case of the Holder inequality, which parallels the triangle inequality but uses products rather than sums. For 10 points, name this French mathematician who gives his name to that inequality along with Hermann Schwarz.

answer: {Prester John} [or {Presbyter Johannes}]

Joao II sent an envoy to this ruler, possibly encouraged by a report of a prior letter received by Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus. Otto of Freising was eager to ask him to reattempt an endeavor frustrated by the flooding of the Tigris, namely an excursion from his capital at Ecbatana in Persia to capture Jerusalem. This "king of the Three Indies"  had an army of 140,000 cavalry and 100,000 infantry, and his grandson David's conquests in Persia and Iraq encouraged the Bishop of Acre until it was discovered that this was actually the work of Genghis Khan. The Ethiopians were just as confused when the Christian states of Europe insisted that this man was their Emperor. For 10 points, name this mythical Nestorian Christian priest-king who supposedly ruled an isolated and wealthy kingdom east of the Muslim lands.

An burst of them important for research was released by Supernova 1987A. A team led by Arthur McDonald solved the discrepancy between other experimental results and a model created by Bahcall, and an experiment by Wu showed that these are almost always left-handed. They were first proposed by Pauli to explain an apparent loss of energy observed in beta decay. One method of detecting them uses the fact that these particles can convert chlorine to argon via the charged current interaction, and another method relies on heavy water. Notable detectors of them include the Homestake Mine, Sudbury, and Super Kamiokande. For 10 points, name these nearly massless uncharged leptons which come in tauon, muon, and electron flavors.
