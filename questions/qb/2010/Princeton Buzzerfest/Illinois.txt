answer: Medea

A messenger is sent to inform the title character of “an unholy, horrible thing” in this work. A command to “not unstop the wineskin's neck” convinces one character in this work to visit the title character. The title character extracts an oath from that infertile king, Aegeus, which allows the title character to give “a dress / of soft weave and a coronet of beaten gold” to another character in this story, as well as pursue an action that the nurse had previously criticized, wondering “Babes, with their father's sin? Why call thy curse on these?” That dress was made with poison which causes the deaths of the king of Corinth, Creon, and his daughter, Glauce. For 10 points, what is this Euripides tragedy that sees the title character kill her children to enact revenge on her husband, Jason?

answer: {Gabriel}-{Honoré Marcel}

Central to this person's thought is the notion that the modern world is typified by the mischaracterization of function, a form of his notion of the “broken world,” in which the world is reduced to a set of problems. A second central notion of this philosopher is that humanity is characterized by its exigencies and can have “with” relationships only with other beings. Those ideas are expounded in this philosopher's first work, Being and Having; a third notion of his entitles his work Creative Fidelity. The source of the usual term for this person's thought comes from “Existentialism is a Humanism”; he would at first accept, then reject that term, “Christian existentialism.” For 10 points, name this early French existentialist, the author of The Mystery of Being.

answer: the {ergodic hypothesis} [accept {ergodycity} or {molecular chaos}]

This idea appears as the non-trivial precondition in the proof of the Poincaré recurrence theorem. An oft-confused fact is that Liouville's theorem is necessary but not sufficient for this theorem to hold. In systems obeying this stricture, the steady-state phase-space PDF is non-zero at all accessible points; therefore, this principle implies that, over a sufficiently long time, a system will visit all accessible microstates. This stricture allows the interchange of time and ensemble averages, so the most common use of this idea is to derive the theorem that each quadratic degree of freedom of a system is associated with the same amount of energy. For 10 points, name this principle that underpins classical statistical mechanics and that is the usual assumption in deriving the equipartition theorem.

answer: {Balkan} Wars

One battle saw the Crown Prince Constantine commit his seven divisions against the VIII Corps of his enemy, an unanticipated decision that led to the downfall of Thessaloniki, while another saw Nikola Ivanov win the most recent Battle of Adrianople. The first lasted two months, then stopped, and restarted after the second coup d'état by the Young Turks, finally ending with the Treaty of London. The second of these conflicts began the day after that treaty was signed, though fighting did not start until King Ferdinand ordered his generals to attack Serbia at the Bregalnica River and Greece at Nigrita. For 10 points, name these wars, the first fought between the namesake league and the Ottoman Empire and the second fought amongst the league's members.

answer: {Ignatius J. Reilly} [accept either; accept A {Confederacy} of {Dunces} before "{this character}"]

Santa Battaglia tries to set up the mother of this character with a vigilant anti-Communist. Earlier, Claude Robichaux ended up getting arrested himself trying to keep this character from being arrested. Twice-offended by the flamboyant-ness of Dorian Greene, he denounces a movie as an “abortion” before having a drink at the Night of Joy Bar, where he regales all with the story of his trip on a Greyhound Scenicruiser. His dog Rex pops into his head while he is masturbating, despite this character being plagued by a broken intestinal valve. At the end of the novel in which he appears, a cockatoo tries to remove the earring worn by this lover of Myrna Minkoff under his green felt hunting cap. This fan of Dr. Nut also leads an unsuccessful workers' revolution at Levy Pants. For ten points, name this John Kennedy Toole character, the protagonist of A Confederacy of Dunces.

answer: {Marbury} v. {Madison}

Calder v. Bull extended the results of this case to the states, and it was first applied in Little v. Barreme, also known as the “Flying Fish” case. Cases arising from the decision of this case include one about the President's power to seize control of steel mills during a war, Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer, and one about the extent of executive privilege, United States v. Nixon. The author of the majority opinion wrote “an act of the legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void,” as the Court ruled in favor of the plantiff's right to his commission as an appeals judge, but against the right of the Court to force its delivery by the Secretary of State. For 10 points, identify this Supreme Court case that saw the first use of the doctrine of judicial review.

answer: The Gospel {According} to {Jesus} Christ [or {O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo}]

One event in this novel is precipitated by a dream, after which a father hears word that causes him to hide his family deeper in a cave; his failure to warn others causes him guilt for the rest of his life. It begins with the same exact dedication to Theophilus as does Luke's Gospel, but it is set apart by the controversial suggestions of a completely human Christ, a non-virgin birth, a conflict between an avaricious God and a compassionate, reluctant Christ, and a sympathetic Devil, as well as by an account of the death of St. Joseph, and multiple references to Portuguese culture. For 10 points, name this controversial satire by the 1998 Nobel Prize winner Jose Saramago, which ends with Christ submitting himself to death, hoping to downplay his significance to come.

answer: The {Venerable} John {Henry Newman}

This man wrote a piece that called for a new interpretation of the Thirty-Nine Articles; that piece brought an end to a series of works that he had started with works that claimed apostolic descent for the clergy of the Church that he would later leave. Tracts for the Times would form the basis of a movement that included Edward Pusey and John Keble, named for an English university. He also wrote a work in response to an article by Charles Kingsley that claimed that he and the Church that he had converted to did not regard truth as a virtue. In that work, he discusses the religious opinions he held throughout his life, including his conversion from Anglicanism to Catholicism. Due to be officially beatified in September, for 10 points, identify this English Cardinal, the founder of the Oxford Movement and the author of Apologia Pro Vita Sua.

answer: {glutamic} acid [accept {glutamate}; accept {E} before it's mentioned]

A family of channel proteins that transport mostly this chemical and its derivatives are the EAATs. The action of molecule's dehydrogenase enzyme results in most of the ammonia eliminated by the urea cycle. PCP works by agonizing this signal molecule by mimicking NMDA, which is itself the namesake of one family of receptors for this molecule. Deamination of this compound yields the same product as the operation of isocitrate dehydrogenase on D-isocitrate; that compound, the third from citrate in the Krebs cycle, is an alpha-keto derivative of this acid. This amino acid with a carboxylic acid side chain has a name abbreviated E. For 10 points, name this compound, the principle brain excitatory neurotransmitter.

He described the titular city as “branchy between towers” in his poem “Duns Scotus's Oxford”. Another poem says the speaker will not “Despair, not feast on” the title entity, and another title object is predicted to “flame out, like shining from shook foil”. In addition to “Carrion Comfort”, another poem of his describes the title creature as “morning's minion”, “daylight's dauphin”, and a “dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon.” Another poem of his praises “Whatever is fickle, freckled” and “skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow”. That poem ends by saying “Praise him”, referring to its first line, where it urged “Glory be to God for dappled things—“. For 10 points, identify this author of “God's Grandeur”, “Pied Beauty”, and “The Windhover”, whose masterpiece was The Wreck of the Deutschland.

answer: {microscopic total cross}-{section} [prompt on {sigma}]

For a given interaction, this value can be obtained up to normalization by integrating the square modulus of an element of the transfer matrix over all orientations. That's the case because this quantity is in general the all-solid-angle integral of a related quantity having the name of this quantity prefixed with differential. One compelling argument for the necessity of quantum theory is the fact that this quantity diverges for Rutherford scattering. This quantity is formally the constant of proportionality between flux and reaction rate density per target density, so this quantity times the target density is the probability of reaction. This variable is usually symbolized lower-case sigma and is often given in the unit barn, equal to ten to the minus twenty-fourth centimeters squared. For 10 points, name this quantity that can be thought of as the probability that one particle will hit another.

answer: {Umayyad} caliphate [or {dynasty}]

Only one ruler of this group was later recognized as a caliph and not merely a secular king; that ruler is Abd al-Aziz. His father dealt with the rebellions by al-Mukhtar in Kufa and the combined forces of the Kharijites, Shi'ah, and Abd Allah ibn az-Zubayr in Iraq. This group was split between the Sufyanids, whose first leader attempted the first siege of Constantinople, and the Marwanids, whose last ruler, Marwan II, died at the Battle of the Great Zab River. They “won” the first Muslim civil war, beating out Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali, and Mu'awiyah, the son of Abu Sufyan, was the first ruler of this polity. Ruling out of Damascus, for 10 points, what is this second Islamic caliphate?

Franco Modigliani and his granddaughter Leah developed M-squared to match this in stocks with a benchmark index, and the Q-measure of probability is also known as “this”-neutral. Bondholders are concerned with the reinvestment form of this concept. Buying a stock while simultaneously selling a call option removes this as a decision criterion and beta is a measure of this relative to the market. Frank Knight wrote a work that contrasts this with another title concept, claiming that this is not randomness with unknowable probabilities, “this”, Uncertainty and Profit. Moral hazard arises when all of this is transferred away from a person; for 10 points, identify this concept that focuses on the chance an investment will provide a low or negative return and that is usually denoted by the lower case sigma.

One specialized form of these entities defined over linear data structures is an iterator. The use of postfix iteration on iterators and other versions of these objects relies on the convention that adding an integer to one of these is equivalent to adding the size of the associated type to its value; that convention is the namesake arithmetic of these objects. C-like languages define arrays as a series of these without gaps. The most basic operation on one of objects returns the value of the object to which it of these is associated; that operation is dereferencing. These objects usually hold representations memory locations and that generally indicate where an associated object is stored. For 10 points, name these objects, the “links” in conventional implementations of linked lists.

The most famous cameo in this movie occurs when The Yardbirds play “Stroll On,” as the main character makes his way through the club venue, looking for the mysterious Jane. This film has the distinction of being the first British film to feature full frontal female nudity, and also caused controversy for the scene in which photographer Thomas has a sexy romp on some lavender paper with two teenage girls.  At the end of the movie, Thomas encounters some mimes in the park and participates in their imaginary game of tennis.   Starring David Hemmings and Vanessa Redgrave, the movie's plot centers on whether the protagonist has captured a murder on his roll of film.

The main character in this work “[dislikes] being questioned” and “never cared for Sundays.” That character kept an ad for Kruschen Salts because it amused him. After the central event in this work, the main character trains himself to remember details, including the story of the Czech, in order to pass the time. That character never even considered marrying his girlfriend until visiting Masson's bungalow. That visit was set up by the main character's relationship with Raymond Sintes. The protagonist enjoys Saturdays spent eating at Celeste's and swimming with Marie Cardona, in contrast to the work's opening scene, when he feels that “they were there to judge him”, and his lack of emotion displayed at his mother's vigil would be used against him in his trial for killing an Arab. For 10 points, identify this novel about Monsieur Meursault, a work by Albert Camus.

One idea posited to limit potential explanations of this feature notes that, because of its strong axisymmetric component, it cannot have been created by a steady MHD flow. The strength of the most powerful interactions undergone by this entity are quantified in the so-called K index; those same interactions cause the South Atlantic Anomaly, which is of great concern to the space program. The aforementioned Cowling's theorem is one wrinkle in the standard theory of this object. Closed banana orbits within this approximate dipole give rise to the Van Allen belts. For 10 points, name this geological phenomenon that, according to the dynamo theory, is caused by flow in the Earth's core.
