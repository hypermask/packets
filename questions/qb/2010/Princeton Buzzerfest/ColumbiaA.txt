This artist created a work in which a woman sits in a box reading a program while two other patrons take their seats below, Two In The Aisle, and another painting in which the titular activity is performed by two faceless people in a boat, Sailing. While this artist painted works showing an empty street and deserted storefronts, complete with barber pole, at the titular time, and one in which two women sit at a table by a window with a small teapot and bowl, as the title sign can be seen outside, his most famous subject sat atop the now vacant Mulry Square near his home in Greenwich Village. For 10 points, name this American painter of Early Sunday Morning and Chop Suey, who depicted an advertisement for Phillies cigars above four people in a diner in Nighthawks.

answer: {Lineweaver}-{Burk} plot [prompt on “{double}-{reciprocal}” {plot}]

Alternative models developed by C.S. Hanes or B.H.J. Hofstee and G.S. Eadie are preferred to this error-prone one. The Briggs-Haldane assumption is used in the formulation of this model. Non-competitive inhibitors decrease maximum reaction velocity but do not affect an eponymous constant, so that the slope rises, but the x-intercept is unchanged. Competitive inhibitors bind the enzyme, increasing the Michaelis constant, so that the slope increases, but the y-intercept is unchanged. Representing the reciprocal of reaction rate plotted against the reciprocal of substrate concentration, name, for 10 points, this doubly eponymous biochemical plot from enzyme kinetics that is used to graphically represent the Michaelis-Menten equation.

answer: {Dirac} equation

Majorana modified this equation by including the charge conjugate of the spin or wave function to describe neutrinos instead of electrons, which coincidentally also have spins of ½.  In Feynman slash notation, it can be summarized as “minus I times delta slash plus mass in brackets times U equals zero.”  Applying the correspondence principle to transform the wave function by a phase factor yields a constant phase gradient, implying an invariant electromagnetic field, a result which became a founding principle of quantum electrodynamics. Any solution to this equation naturally solves the Klein-Fock-Gordon equation.  Predicting the existence of antiparticles four years before Carl Anderson discovered the positron, for 10 points, name this central wave equation of quantum field theory formulated by the 1932 Lucasian Chair in Cambridge and 1933 Nobel Prize winner in Physics.

In the second canto of this work, two characters are fooled by one deity, and lead their people into an ambush, only to be rescued by Venus. While sailors are listening to the story of “The Twelve of England”, Venus saves them again, by sending nymphs to distract the winds tasked to destroy them by Bacchus. Finally, Venus tasks Cupid with creating an Island of Love for the sailors, after they escape from the efforts of some people in Calicut to detain them, after one of those Muslims is manipulated by Bacchus.

This case's decision is almost always cited along with the Panama Refining case, specifically by Byron White in INS v. Chadha where he noted “restrictions on the scope of the power that could be delegated… have all but disappeared.” Though its underlying principle was seemingly supported by the previous year's Home Building and Loan v. Blaisdell, Justice Cardozo agreed with Hughes' statement in this decision that “extraordinary conditions” do not create or enlarge constitutional power. Derided by the sitting president as a “horse and buggy” interpretation of the Constitution, and affecting the drafting of the National Labor Relations Act, for 10 points, name this 1935 case, a dagger in FDR's NIRA, that revolved wage, hour and quality conditions at some Brooklyn slaughterhouses.
