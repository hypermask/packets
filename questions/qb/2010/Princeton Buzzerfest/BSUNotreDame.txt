In one work, Robert Dahl spoke about talked about a third transformation of this in a work titled for this “and its critics,” which in an earlier work he had organized along two theoretical principles, contestation and inclusion. That work was a result of Joseph Schumpeter's call for an empirical definition of this concept. 1970's Spain had been the starting point of a “third wave” of this according to Samuel Huntington, and in “An Economic Theory of” this, Anthony Downs provided a theoretical method of voter choice. Robert Jervis wrote that the “Bush Doctrine” revolved around the “peace theory” associated with this, much like Woodrow Wilson. For 10 points, name this form of government, which Joseph Schumpeter wrote about in “Capitalism, Socialism, and” this, and Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about “in America.”

The Langemark war cemetery memorializes those who died during battles named for this place. An incident in which several German units were killed by a small force of experienced Boer War veterans occurred at a battle named for this polity and is called "The Massacre of the Innocents of" this place. A later battle at this place was led primarily to cripple German submarine warfare by capturing German port cities but proved inconclusive, in part because the area surrounding this city was located on reclaimed marshland which turned to thick mud after being repeatedly shelled, and it also marked the first use of poison gas on the Western Front. For 10 points, name this Belgian city, site of multiple World War I battles.

answer: {infrared spectroscopy} [or {IR spectroscopy}]

The attenuated total reflection type of this can be used on compounds with a low surface area, while the diffuse reflectance type can be used to study samples that are not sufficiently transparent. The multiplex advantage explains the use of the Fourier Transform type of this. Diatomic bonds are generally not found in the fingerprint region, and the stretching seen using this technique generally occurs at higher frequencies than the bending. Most types of this use some sort of absorption, because each bond in the molecule will absorb only its characteristic frequency. For 10 points, name this type of analytical technique, which categorizes compounds based on the frequency of the vibration of its bonds when exposed to radiation of waves longer than those of visible light.

answer: determinant

This multilinear function can be used to determine orientation in Euclidean spaces, and the Gram is a type of this obtained from integrals of functions. It can be used to find the eigenvalues of an endomorphism, and can be calculated recursively using cofactors, summing the minors multiplied by one or negative one. It is Abelian, while the structure it is calculated from is not, and is not invertible. The Wronskian is obtained from functions and derivatives. When it has a value of one, that structure is unimodular, a value of zero means that structure is singular, and it remains constant under the transpose operation. It is used in Cramer's Rule to solve systems of linear equations. For 10 points, name this mathematical object derived from matrices, which for a two by two matrix can be calculated as a*d - b*c.

The term of the first president of this country, Charles Debbas, was extended by one year after a proposal to break an electoral deadlock involving Emile Iddi. Iddi would later become the last president of this country under French control, which ended after the Battle of Damour in this country; a subsequent battle led to the Armistice of Acre. That French control had been guaranteed by the terms of the Sykes-Picot Treaty, and it was given its mandate over this country at the San Remo conference. Its National Pact established a division of power along its confessional cleavages, with the office of Prime Minister being reserved for Sunnis and the presidency being given to the Maronite majority. For 10 points, name this country, whose fifteen-year civil war saw invasions by both Israel and Syria, whose capital is Beirut.

The Aborigines consider the morning star Barnumbirr to be one of these, while the owl-headed Muut is this figure to the Cahuilla tribe. Animals associated with these include dolphins to the Romans and horses to the Celts and Teutons. The Inuit consider the Aurora Borealis to be flickering torchlights lit by these figures, while in Japanese mythology, one of these figures, Jizo, hides children under his robe to save them from having to wait on the shores of the Sanzu River for all eternity. Xolotl from Aztec mythology helps in the crossing of a jaguar-filled river of blood and a field filled with flying knives on the journey to Mictlan. Their collective name, literally meaning “guide of souls,” is derived from the epithet of one of their most well-known examples, Hermes. For 10 points, name these figures whose function is to escort the souls of the dead to the afterlife, represented in Norse mythology by the Valkyries.

answer: peat {bogs} [peat {mires}]

These feature a stratum called acrotelm over a layer called catotelm. Phosphates are bound by calcium, iron and humus, which along with dissolved manganese, sulfur, and iron ions render these areas nutrient-poor and inhospitable to plant life. Schwingmoor types are made up of a floating mat of organic material which, because of the lack of oxygen, is unable to decompose fully, while the blanket variety holds that material above ground and exists in flat areas in oceanic climates with high humidity. The high acidity requires specialization of flora, including tyrphobionts such as sphagnum mosses. For 10 points, name these areas where poor drainage causes accumulation of organic material, forming peat.

This was predated by the First System run by the Iberian nations and was a closed system closely controlled by the state. Sometimes called the Maafa, V.S. Naipul wrote of its aftereffects in a book named for it. The last known ship to participate in it was the Clotilde, which sailed to Mobile, Alabama. Another ship that sailed it was depicted by J. M. W. Turner in a painting, and Robert Hayden wrote a poem with its name. The actions of the captain of the Zong became notorious in it, and proved a catalyst for people including William Wilberforce to help outlaw it in Great Britain. Another participating ship, whose “cargo” was freed by an 1831 Supreme Court case, was La Amistad.

answer: {asthma}

This disease is often caused by the transformation of TH0 cells into TH2 cells, which triggers the humeral immune system to produce antibodies. Beta2-adrenergic agonists interrupt the response to this, and can be used to treat this, although recently two such drugs have been removed as treatments because without steroids, they can exacerbate the condition. Leukotriene antagonists relieve symptoms of this by inhibiting the fatty molecules that accompany histamine production. It can be diagnosed by spirometry, which is more accurate than measuring peak flow rates. The characteristic symptom that accompanies it is caused by the production of mucous and a constriction of the bronchi. For 10 points, name this common ailment that inflames the lungs and makes it hard to breathe.
