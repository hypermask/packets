answer: {Maltese}

The first epic poem written in this language is Il Gifen-Tork, and the title of the first novel in this language translates to Elvira, or the Love of a Tyrant. After Athanasius Kircher visited the area where it is most widely spoken, he offered evidence against the then-prevailing theory that it was descended from ancient Punic. The first known document written in this language is the fifteenth-century poem Il Cantilena by Pietru Caxaro. Like many other languages in its family, such as Amharic, most of its words have triliteral roots, meaning that they consist of three consonants. However, it is unique among its language family in that it uses the Latin alphabet. For 10 points, name this Semitic language now known to be descended from Siculo-Arabic, the official language of a tiny island nation in the Mediterranean Sea.

answer: {Klinefelter's syndrome}

The main symptoms of this disease may be caused by the inability of Sertoli cells to communicate with the other cells in their environment; those symptoms include microorchidism, which is brought by the hypogonadism that results. More severely, this condition can lead to an increased risk of contracting breast cancer, partially due to the gynecomastia that sometimes results, or osteoporosis, especially if testosterone replacement therapy has not been undergone. However, it is believed that people with this disease are less likely to contract X-linked recessive diseases. The most common sex-chromosome disorder, this is, for 10 points, what disease in which men possess an extra X chromosome, named after the American endocrinologist who first described it?

answer: {American Federation} of Labor [or {AFL}-{CIO}, do not accept after “{industry}”]

This organization organized a boycott involving white stickers to demonstrate their opposition to immigration from a certain country. This organization was founded after a dispute when part of another similar organization broke a cigar makers' strike in New York by undercutting the strikers' wage demands; a member of the striking union would become this group's first president. One initiative pursued under his leadership was the placing of white stickers of cigars made by white workers in opposition to Chinese immigration.

answer: {Tory} Party

This group emerged during disputes with the self-styled “True Protestants”, in turn referring to themselves as the Abhorrers.  Initial success in that conflict was exemplified by the crushing of the Monmouth Rebellion.  The prosecution of preacher Henry Sacheverell and the namesake disturbances led to another of this group's successes, the creation of the Riot Act, thirty years after their defeat of the Exclusion Act. Cromwell's conquests during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms led to the phenomenon that named this party, by causing an increase in landless, armed Irish-Catholics. It declined from its heyday, when led by such figures as William Pitt the Younger, to a small surviving faction headed by Benjamin Disraeli that became its spiritual successor, the modern Conservative Party. Rising to prominence due to their defense of royal power during the English Restoration, this is, for 10 points, what British political party, which was opposed by the Whigs?

answer: {Gauss's} Law

One form of this law is equivalent to Newton's theorem of universal gravitation and allows for calculation of the gravitational field. Since gravity is a conservative force with zero curl, as are the other forces this law deals with, the differential form of this law simply becomes Poisson's equation, allowing for the calculation of both potential and field. Applications of this law usually involve constructing one of its namesake surfaces around a model object (such as a Bouguer plate) through which flux is measured. A more commonly seen form of this law can be derived from Coulomb's law through integration and application of the Dirac delta function, and its differential form states that the divergence of the electric field is proportional to the charge density. For 10 points, name this theorem whose electromagnetic form is one of Maxwell's laws, which relates field strength to either mass or charge.

The first ruler of this empire was advised by the author of a treatise on statecraft called the Arthashastra, Chanakya. That ruler consolidated his power by defeating Magadha, and he left a vast empire to his son Bindusara. This empire's third ruler was so sickened by his expansive military conquests that he built thousands of stupas and famously converted to Buddhism.

A notable feature of the fifth and sixth programs by this name was the Virgin Lands Campaign.

answer: {Consolation} of Philosophy [or {Consolatio Philosophiae}]

God is defined as a “helm and rudder” keeping the universe in line without actually intervening in the third book of this work. In the fourth book of this work, evil is presented as something that makes its perpetrators less human, so evildoers would actually prefer to be stopped. However, this definition necessitates a shift in the meaning of God, as later in the fourth book He is defined as the efficient cause of all things. This work also defines the “highest good” in two ways, by knowing God as perfect happiness, and through “true good” of virtue and sufficiency. Its author wrote the work, which also covers such topics as free will and predestination, as a dialogue between himself and Lady Philosophy. Written while its author awaited his execution for treason against King Theodoric the Great, for 10 points, name this work of Boethius.

answer: {cyclopropane}

This type of molecule can be formed from the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction, which reacts trimethylsulfonium iodide with an enone, or through the Simmons-Smith reaction where it is formed from the reaction of a cerbenoid with an alkene. A functionalized variant of this molecule can be formed through the reaction of a titanium reagent with an amine in the de Meijere variation of the Kulinkovich reaction, which uses an ester. Baeyer strain in this molecule can perhaps be explained by a model that attempts to describe its bonding using sp2 hybridization, doing away with bent or banana bonds, a model named for Walsh, and the cation of its alkene is the simplest aromatic compound. This is, for 10 points, what simplest cyclic alkane?
