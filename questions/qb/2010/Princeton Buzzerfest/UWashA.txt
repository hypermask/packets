One of these entities may contain Kordylewski clouds, while another one of them contains objects called the Greek Camp. The namesake of these objects predicted their existence while considering a restricted case of a problem solved in general by Sundman. Three of them are unstable, but the other two can be stable given a sufficiently high mass ratio. These components of the circular restricted three-body problem solution contain the Trojans Asteroids and at these locations the net gravitational pull is precisely equal to the centripetal force necessary to maintain a common orbit. For 10 points, name these positions where an object will remain motionless with respect to the orbit of two larger bodies, named for a French-Italian creator of the calculus of variations and a namesake multiplier.

answer: {linear} [accept first {line} buzz on {Linear Equations}]

Krylov subspace methods are used to study certain entities of this type, and this type of system ensures only one reference to any object at a time. This property with time independence implies a system's effect is uniquely determined by its impulse response. This kind of continuous functional on a space forms that space's dual. The heat equation, the Helmholtz equation, and the wave equation are all this type of differential equation and thus satisfy the superposition principle. The bisection method for root-finding has this type of convergence, and the worst-case of sequential search proceeds in this type of time. For 10 points, name this property in mathematics, which for a function f means that f of A times x plus B times y equals A times f of x plus B times f of y.

answer: {p53} [or Protein 53 or Tumor Protein 53]

Herzog et al. showed that this protein is activated by ATM kinase, and a different study showed it also activated by ATR kinase. Along with its regulator, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, this protein is controlled by the Wip1 gatekeeper. When the pathway named for this protein is damaged, the retinoblastoma pathway is often damaged as well. Inheritance problems in this gene, along with CHEK2, can lead to Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. When it binds with DNA, it generates a similarly named entity that inhibits cdk2. In humans, it is suppressed by HDM2, a homolog of mdm2. Its production can be stimulated by bombarding DNA with gamma or x-rays, requiring repair, and as a last resort, it induces apoptosis. For 10 points, name this tumor suppressing protein often mutated in cancer sufferers, “the guardian of the genome.
