answer: {Piano Sonatas} by {Ludwig van Beethoven}

In one of these works, a three-note motif begins the first movement with a strong bass response of four chords. Another of these works features a scherzo second movement that starts with a hunting-call figure and falls into a minor-mode trio. Yet another one of these works features a relaxed andante for its second movement, which is a set of variations on a simple, chorale-like theme and features an impassioned finale. In that same work, the first movement opens with a dark theme that abruptly explodes that features handfuls of chords and figuration that requires the player to use the utmost delicacy. One of the most famous of these works has a first movement that features a brooding opening, the “sighing” passage, and a regretful little hymn with modulations and repeats itself.  Others have names such as “Tempest” and “Cuckoo.” For 10 points, name these compositions by a certain German composer that include “Appassionata” and “Moonlight.”

The first battle in this conflict occurred just outside Calama, and witnessed the demise of Eduardo Abaroa, who made his reputation in that engagement, the Battle of Topáte. This conflict began in part due to a tax placed on a nitrate and railway company, and escalated after the outing of an alliance between nations led Mariano Prado and Hilarión Daza. Manuel González' victory at Tacna effectively removed Bolivia from this conflict less than a year after forces led by Juan Jose Latorre killed Peruvian naval hero Miguel Grau and captured his ship, the Huáscar, at the Battle of Angamos.

answer: Denver {Nuggets} [either is acceptable]

This team's only Finals appearance came under Larry Brown, and it was actually in the ABA in the year before the merger, 1976. This team is not Golden State, but they are the first team to win a playoff series as an 8th seed against a 1st seed, doing so against the SuperSonics in 1994. Under another coach, this team set a record for consecutive games scoring over 100 points, with Doug Moe's motion offense setting Alex English and Kiki Vandeweghe loose. Despite that history, the team endured a long period of mediocrity until acquiring a graduate of their city's George Washington High School through trade and, with the third pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, a Syracuse alum. For 10 points, name this NBA franchise who took the Lakers to six games in the 2009 Western Conference Finals, that features Chauncey Billups and Carmelo Anthony.

answer: {Critique} of {Pure Reason} [or {Kritik der reinen Vernunft}]

A criticism of this work by Frege claims that it bases one important distinction on the subject-predicate form of grammar. According to the author, the mind takes an active role in shaping information, creating ideas like time and space, but the author rejects the Rationalist position that nothing is knowable. This works uses the example of a collapsing house to contrast a priori and a posteriori knowledge and the example of seven plus five equals twelve to contrast analytic and synthetic judgements. This work is more famous for calling external stimuli that live in the noumena things-in-themselves. For 10 points, name this philosophical tract by Immanuel Kant that defines metaphysics as the titular pursuit.

Andrews and Smithson categorized these into four types based on dip patterns and fabric strengths, and these may have caused the pattern of Clarion and Webster soils in central Iowa. A Rogen variety may be caused by velocity gradients, and a push variety of this feature can be recognized by rocks disturbed from their original orientation. Kettle lakes may form when water is trapped behind one of these. The recessional variety is a retreating example of the terminal variety and reveals climate history, while lateral ones are found along the sides of their generating features. Drumlins can be formed from the ground variety of these by streamlining by overriding ice. For 10 points, name this accumulation of till and debris carried or deposited by a glacier.

The fantastically named Foster McGowan Voorhees held this post at the turn of the 20th century, and earlier the loser in the 1864 presidential election, George McClellan, served a single term as it. One of its more accomplished occupants served two terms in the 1980s before chairing the 9/11 Commission. In addition to Thomas Kean, one former holder of this position was famously photographed frisking Sherron Rolax, a photo which drew criticism from civil rights groups.

answer: {Wolff}-{Kishner} reduction [or reaction]

A synthesis of withasomnine makes use of a variant of this reaction to cleave bicyclic pyrazole rings. Parquet and Lin report the time taken by this reaction may be reduced by use of a microwave oven, and it requires the use of a polar, high-boiling solvent like ethylene glycol. One modification of this reaction puts all of the reagents in one pot; that one is named for Huang-Minlon. In its third step, a resonance-stabilized carbocation reacts with water to form a diazene, which is then deprotonated. After that step, the production of nitrogen gas keeps the reaction from reversing. Its first step involves the conversion of the primary reagent to a hydrazone by reaction with hydrazine. For 10 points, name this reaction that reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes, the basic analogue of the Clemmensen reduction.

One of these was negotiated in part by Johan Willem and allowed the Ostend Company the same rights in the Spanish colonies as Dutch and English trade companies in exchange for Austria abandoning its claims on the Spanish throne.

Roberval found that the area under this curve is equal to three pi times its height squared, and Wren solved Pascal's challenge to determine its arc length to be eight times its height. This shape is equal to both its evolute and involute, and a parametric equation for this curve is given by x equals a times quantity t minus sine of t and y equals quantity one minus cosine of t. This curve has the property that a particle along it experiences simple harmonic motion with amplitude independent of starting location, and this curve is the unique solution to the problem asking for which curve will a bead slide to another point in the least time.

answer: {Black}-{Scholes} model

Utilization of this idea caused the collapse of the John Meriwether-helmed firm Long-Term Capital Management, which employed two of its formulators on its board of directors; its failure was helped by the assumption of efficient markets in this idea. This hypothesis uses geometric Brownian motion as its basis, and in practice employs GBM as a means of charting variances in market prices over a given period. The deregulation of the derivatives market allowed for the application of this model in the stock market, as it removed the need for a stock to pay a dividend, another assumption of this model. Used by hedge funds that bet long and short on the derivative of the same stock, for 10 points, name this economic model that allows traders to profit as the two positions move toward an equilibrium state, developed in part by Robert Merton.

He also awarded eight Lord Proprietors land that would become Carolina.

answer: {Dopamine} [or {4}-({2}-{aminoethyl}){benzene}-{1,2}-{diol}, prompt on “{DA}”]

Phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine work by blocking receptors for this molecule, which is transported to its primary location in the tuberoinfundibular pathway. Monoamine oxidase and catechol-o-methyl transferase break down this chemical, a process enhanced by the drug reserpine. A catecholamine produced in the substantia nigra and released from the hypothalamus, this compound inhibits the release of prolactin in the pituitary gland, among other functions. Derived from tyrosine and a precursor to adrenaline, disorders that result from a deficiency in this molecule include ADHD and Parkinson's disease. For 10 points, name this inhibitory neurotransmitter implicated in arousal and addiction and supposedly central to pleasure and reward.
