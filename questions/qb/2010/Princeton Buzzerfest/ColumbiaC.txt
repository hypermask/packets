answer: Battle of {Kursk}

The OKH rejected a plan to lure the Soviets into the Donets River basin, there to be trapped against the Sea of Azov, instead selecting the brainchild of Chief of Staff Zeitzler over Field Marshal von Manstein. This maneuver, which reached its climax at the Battle of Prokhorovka, was in the Kesselschlacht concept, with the two prongs coming from Orel and Karkhov. Operation Citadel was delayed at Hitler's order multiple times before execution, and Stavka and Georgy Zhukov had to convince Stalin to take advantage of the information garnered by the Lucy spy ring, and wait until the Germans launched their predictable assault against one of the most heavily entrenched salient on earth. Marking the debut of a vehicle to counter the Soviet T-34, for 10 points, name this battle in which the Panther tank first appeared, the costliest single day of aerial warfare and the largest tank battle in history.

This work's fifth chapter discusses, among other things, the purpose of families to preserve the dead, rather than protect their members, and how governments maintain control over them. Its chapter on religion holds that religion is just of form of consciousness of the absolute being, meaning that it has already been discussed in preceding chapters on Consciousness, Self-consciousness, and the title concept. Reason is the same as the title concept only when it is regarded as absolute truth, and brain fibers are incorrectly regarded as the "being" of the title concept, but are revealed to be dead objects when actually inspected. The master-slave dialectic is described in, for 10 points, what philosophical work by G. W. F. Hegel?

answer: {Lockheed U}-{2} [accept {Dragon Lady}]

The CIA initiated Project RAINBOW in an attempt to keep this from being detected. Although this project ultimately failed, it did lead to the development of the A-12. Plans to retire this vehicle have been postponed to at least 2012 or 2014 to allow for additional time to ready its replacement, the RQ-4. Originally powered by Pratt & Whitney J57 engines, this vehicle is exceedingly difficult to operate, since it was designed for rapid flight at high altitudes with its long, thin wings. On October 14, 1962, one of these aircraft was responsible for capturing images of the Soviet military installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, sparking to the Cuban Missile Crisis. For 10 points, name this reconnaissance aircraft, which became well known after a CIA pilot was shot down in one over Soviet territory on May 1st, 1960, resulting in the capture of Francis Gary Powers.

Field-induced Neel ordering with magnons in antiferromagnets is an example of this. The wave function of this can be described by an equation that adds a term based on the scattering length and the Dirac delta function to the Schrodinger equation; that equation is named for Gross and Pitaevskii. The superfluidity of He-4 was eventually determined to be caused by this substance being dispersed in the liquid, and the one created by Wolfgang Ketterle had about a hundred times more atoms than the first one created.

Their formation can be mediated by the Sec23/24 homodimer in yeast, but only when used for anterograde movement. Several ones are found in MVBs, which themselves are a specialized type of this structure. The tetanus and botulinum toxins interfere with their role in neuronal activity, specifically by targeting t-SNARES and v-SNARES, while ones that bear GLUT4 in muscle cells are highly responsive to insulin levels. The COPI complex allows them to form from the cis-Golgi, while clathrin facilitates their traffic between the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi. These organelles are typically specialized by their contents, and serve as the basis for organelles like the vacuole and the lysosome. For 10 points, name these highly adaptable lipid bubbles within the cell, which come in transport, secretory, and synaptic varieties.

John Penruddock led an uprising during this period that led to the nation's division into military districts, which were controlled by Army Major Generals. During this time, a war was ended that led to the signing of the Treaty of Westminster, as Admiral Robert Blake's forces won the Battle of Scheveningen to end the First Anglo-Dutch War. One of the generals in that war, George Monck, would prove instrumental in ending this period, as he eventually used his forces to allow the seating of a new Parliament and accepting the issuance of the Declaration of Breda, in which the conditions for retaking the throne were laid out by Charles Stuart.

He issued a fatwa against those who teach that souls do not return to bodies after death, saying this would lead people to disregard shari'a. This condemnation included the Isma'ilite sect, which he also falsely accused of believing in two gods. He also opposed the Sunni practice of fiqh, which he felt offered insufficient guidance on the path to salvation. Beyond jurisprudence, he wrote in support of medicine in the Revival of Religious Sciences, but condemned astrology. His greatest focus was the importance of mysticism, which he detailed in The Deliverance from Error, and he converted to Sufism and associated himself with the Asharite school. His greatest contribution to Islamic philosophy was his criticism of the adoption of Aristotelean philosophy into Islamic works, particularly those of Avicenna. Name this religious philosopher from Tus who, for 10 points, wrote the Incoherence of the Philosophers.

Excitons in a conjugated polymer can be approximated using it by adding a term for Coulombic force and applying the linear combination of atomic orbitals across the length of the polymer. An n-dimensional version of it will have energy levels of n degeneracy, and if the constraints of this system allow, tunneling can be also be solved for. The Hamiltonian for it is simplified because the potential energy term can be omitted, which allows the set of eigenvalues to be solved exactly, making it useful for modeling more complex systems and as a teaching tool.

These entities' name was first coined by American theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler, though German mathematician Hermann Weyl had already proposed a theory about them, in connection with his mass analysis of electromagnetic field energy. One variety of these, also known as Einstein-Rosen Bridges, can be modeled as vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equations, combining a black hole and a white hole, but are so unstable that they vanish even before light can pass through. Those are named for Schwarzchild, and Kip Thorne and Mike Morris published the first report on traversable varieties of these structures. For 10 points, name these entities, generally thought of as shortcuts in space-time.

This battle took place on Kalkriese Hill during torrential rains, which prevented one from using their sinew-string bows and waterlogged shields. They fell into a trap at the foot of the hill, where the road was narrow, sandwiched between the Great Bog on one side and the hill on the other, and it was also blocked by a trench, and ran near a wall from behind which the enemies attacked. They had been led to that hill by false rumors of rebellion started by the leader of the enemy side, and were ambushed by members of the Cherusci, Marsi, Chatti, Bructeri, Chauci, and Sicambri tribes, who united under Arminius. For 10 points, name this 9 A.D. battle in which an alliance of Germanic tribes under Arminius defeated Romans under Publius Quinctilius Varus, also known as the Varian disaster.

The first piece in this work starts with alternating G7 and D7 chords and the performer is given the instruction to play it “slowly and mournfully.” All of them are in 3/4 time and use deliberate dissonances against the harmony, producing a melancholy effect. In attempt to draw more attention to the composer of this work, Claude Debussy arranged the first and third parts of this work for orchestra, but claimed that the second one was too difficult to orchestrate. This work was based upon a poem called “The Ancient” by Contamine de Latour, whose last line contains the title of this work. Its title refers to an annual Spartan celebration where naked men displayed their athleticism through dancing.
