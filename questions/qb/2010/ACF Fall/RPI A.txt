answer: determinant

This value can be calculated by Dodgson's condensation.  The volume of a parallelepiped is equal to the absolute value of this for an object of which the shape's bounding vectors are the components.  One can find this value by applying the Laplace expansion, which also called expansion by minors.  Taking a ratio of them can be used to solve a linear system via Cramer's rule. For an identity matrix, the value for this is one, and if this zero, then the matrix is singular. For 10 points, name this value which for a two by two matrix can be found by taking the difference of the two diagonals.
