answer: {trapezoid}

Dagan, Golumbic, and Pinter defined the class of graphs that generalize interval and permutation graphs and correspond to this shape. Romberg's algorithm recursively uses a technique named for this shape that is the two points Newton-Cotes formula. That technique uses small line segments to approximate the definite integral. It's not a triangle, but the isosceles version of this shape has diagonals equal to the square root of the sum of the square of the leg length and the product of the bases. The area of this figure is equal to its height times the length of the central median, which is the average of the bases. For 10 points, name this quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides.

answer: electric field

In semiconductors, the mobility is multiplied by this entity to get drift velocity. In the Lorentz force law, unlike a similar quantity it is not multiplied by the velocity. Its divergence is equal to the charge density divided by the permittivity of space. The cross product of this quantity with the magnetic field appears in the equation for the Poynting Vector. The Stark effect refers to this entity splitting spectral lines. It polarizes dielectrics, allowing capacitors to store energy in capacitors.  For 10 points, name this field whose magnitude at a location is defined as the strength of the force divided by the point charge that experienced it.
