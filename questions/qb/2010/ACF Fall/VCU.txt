answer: {entropy}

For an isothermal process, the change in this quantity is equal to nR (en are) times the natural log of the ratio of volumes. Heat capacity is equal to temperature times the partial derivative of this quantity with respect to temperature.  This quantity can be calculated by finding the natural logs of available microstates, and its change is equal to the change in heat divided by temperature.  It can be defined as the amount of thermal energy in a system that cannot do useful work, and the second law of thermodynamics means that for the universe this is always increasing. For 10 points, name this measurement of disorder in a system.

A congruence class Zn (zee en) is a field if and only if n is a member of the set formed by these numbers The existence of arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of them was proven by Green and Tao.  One theorem about these numbers states that a number a is congruent to a to the n mod n if n has this distinction. If n divides a times b and n is one of these, then n divides a or b according to Euclid's Lemma.  They can be found using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and another result by Euclid states that there are an infinite number of them.
