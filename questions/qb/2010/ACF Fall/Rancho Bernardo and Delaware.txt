Instances of these devices with stacked lamination uses an alternate method of E and I laminations. Large ones can use oil for insulation. Scott-t ones can handle two to three phase connections.  Their components can be in delta or wye configurations. The cores of these devices can be three, four, or five limbed. Electric audio amplifiers, particularly those in a class b, use center tapped ones on the input and the output.  The ratio of voltages associated with one of these devices is proportional to the ratio of turns. They can be used to step up or down voltage.  For 10 points, name these devices that transfer electrical energy from one AC circuit to another using induction.

answer: {money}

The amount of this quantity increases when banks can lend, according to the multiplier effect. One theory of this is based on an equation which contains the product of the average price level and the volume of transactions, the Fisher Equation; that theory is known as the “quantity theory” of this. The rate at which this is exchanged is called its velocity. The three aggregates of this quantity include bank deposits, savings accounts, and repurchase agreements, and are known as M1, M2, and M3. By Gresham's law, bad amounts of it drive out good amounts at a fixed rate of exchange. For 10 points, name this staple of the economy consisting of coins and banknotes.

answer: Polymerase {Chain Reaction} [or {PCR}]

A salt correction formula derived from 1998 SantaLucia paper is commonly used to design a component used in this technique. The emulsion variant of this lab procedure uses capture beads and oil in water microreactors.  That variant is used in 454 sequencing. Mastermix is a combination of many of the chemical components needed in this process. It was enzymes such as TAQ that made this technique possible because of the high temperatures. This technique typically consists of a denaturation step, followed by annealing and elongation. It uses primers and DNA polymerase.  For 10 points, name this laboratory technique which is used to amplify DNA samples.
