answer: {alcohols}

This type of organic molecule is oxidized in the Swern oxidation. They can also be oxidized by Pyridinium chlorochromate, which is abbreviated PCC. Tosyl chloride converts these into tosylates, and thionyl chloride reacts with them to form alkyl chlorides. They react with carboxylic acids in the Fischer esterification. Reacting aldehydes with an organomagnesium halide reagent creates these. Sulfuric acid can be used to dehydrate these in elimination reactions governed by Zaitsev's rule. Tertiary ones are reactive with hydrogen halides in the SN1 reaction. For 10 points, name these organic compounds that have a hydroxyl group, an example of which is ethanol.
