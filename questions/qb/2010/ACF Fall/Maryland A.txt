answer: Stanley {Milgram}

In one of this thinker's experiments, his graduate students found it difficult to ask fellow subway riders for their seats, even though most obliged. In another, he found that people were less willing to mail lost letters if they were addressed to odious organizations. Mr. Jacobs was a prolific friend of a stockbroker in Sharon, Massachusetts, who passed letters on to him from Omaha in this man's Small World experiment, which gave rise to the idea of “six degrees of separation”. For 10 points, name this psychologist who showed that subjects were willing to give electrical shocks up to 450 volts to actors who got questions wrong in his namesake experiment on obedience.

answer: predator

This type of organism has a namesake pit that can occur when limited states exist. The functional responses of these organisms are divided into three types, with “type two” including saturation and extinction. The canonical differential equation for them includes a conversion efficiency factor. Changes in their population size lead to trophic cascades. Their interaction is described by the Lotka-Volterra equation. Mobbing is a response to them, as is aposematism and mimicry. Those that do not have any organism in a similar relationship to themselves are apex ones.  For 10 points, name this type of organism that kills prey for sustenance.

answer: {black holes}

The masses of these objects are related to velocity dispersion in the M-sigma relation, and their abrupt spin flip may be a result of galaxy mergers. They can be described by a metric named for Kerr when they possess angular momentum, and that metric allows angular momentum to be extracted in a process named for Penrose. The simplest metric describing these objects gives a namesake radius equal to two G M over c squared or two thirds of the radius of the photon sphere; that radius is named for Schwarzschild. They have an event horizon. For 10 points, name these objects with a singularity in the center from which not even light can escape.

answer: {simple harmonic oscillator}

Normal mode expansion is used to decompose coupled versions of these systems. The quantum version of one of them has a minimum energy level of h bar omega over two. An electrical example of these systems is a series RLC circuit. This system becomes more complex if the right-hand side is changed from 0 to a force term, or if a first derivative term is added to the left side. Those phenomena in this system are called “driving” and “damping” respectively, and the basic version of this system is developed by equating Newton's second law with Hooke's law. For 10 points, name this type of physical system that is exemplified by a mass on a spring.

Prefetching in LDS can be accomplished using the jump type of these objects. A dispatch table consists of function ones. C allows arithmetic with these objects, which are used for the internal representation of arrays. When objects in memory are deallocated, these can dangle. A segmentation fault arises when these objects do not correspond to a valid location. Each node in a linked list contains two of these data types, one of which can be dereferenced to return the next node. References are safer ways to handle some of the functionality of these objects. For 10 point, name this type of variable which stores a memory address of another variable.
