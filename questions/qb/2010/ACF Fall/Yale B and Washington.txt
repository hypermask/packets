answer: diffusion

The zero-length column method was designed to measure this process within zeolite crystals. Its rate is the denominator of the Thiele modulus.  The effective constant for it is a function of its bulk constant along with tortuosity and hindrance factors. Large scale enriching uranium is accomplished using centrifugation or this process.  The mass flux is a function of the partial derivative of concentration with respect to length in Fick's law describing this. Osmosis is this of water across a membrane.  For 10 points, name this phenomenon resulting from the random movement of particles that sees transfer between regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration.

answer: {T} cells

The AIRE gene is expressed in cells that help these cells mature. The receptor of these cells interacts with a complex that has two epsilon chains, along with a delta and gamma chain. Lck and ZAP-70 are important to this type of cell's signaling pathway. Unlike an associated class of cells, they undergo both positive and negative selection. A very small percentage of these cells are known as delta-gamma cells. FOXP3 acts as a marker for regulatory ones. They have CD3 and two major types of them are distinguished by whether they have CD4 or CD8.  For 10 points, name these lymphocytes that come in cytotoxic and helper varieties, which are not B cells.
