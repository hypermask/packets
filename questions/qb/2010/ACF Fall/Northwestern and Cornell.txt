answer: plant cell {wall}

Multinet growth only occurs in this structure's outer layers, but the microfibrils that primarily compose it are laid mostly transverse to its direction of growth. Its growth occurs via the loosening of the microfibrils, pectins, and other polymers, as regulated by expansins and caused by acidic conditions stimulated by auxin. The interconnection of these structures is the apoplast.  It is very thin for parenchyma and growing cells, while its lignified secondary type makes up much of xylem tissue. There are usually primary and secondary instances of this structure. For 10 points, name this outer layer made mostly of cellulose, that provides structural support to a plant cell.

answer: reaction {rate} [or {rate} constant; or {rate law} before mentioned]

The RRK theory allows one to calculate this quantity for one type of interaction. The Brönsted-Bjerrum equation corrects the constant involved in this quantity for a particular effect. It's not equilibrium, but the log of the ratio of its constants is found in the Hammett equation.  Primary isotope effects and the salt effect alter this quantity. Its constant can be found with an equation that takes an exponential of negative activation energy divided by RT, the Arrhenius equation. The order of a component is the exponent to which its component is raised in the laws named for this quantity, which can be increased by a catalyst.  For 10 points, name this measure of the speed of a reaction.

answer: frequency

The log of this value is the x axis of a Bode plot. In Shannon's theorem, a log term is multiplied by a number that has the same units as these and represents a width of these.  For a cyclotron, this value is q b over two pi m.  The set of these associated with a string under tension are multiples of a quantity that is the square root of the ratio of the product of length and tension to mass all divided by twice the length.  For a pendulum, it is equal to the square root of the ratio of g to length divided by two pi. This value is inversely proportional to the wavelength.  For 10 points, name this number of times a cyclical occurrence happens in a period of time which is measured in hertz.

answer: {complex} number

These numbers are the input to a Möbius transformation, and Gaussian integers are this sort of number.  They can be represented by a two by two matrix with top row x negative y and bottom row y x.  Holomorphic functions take these numbers as inputs. Phasors are another way to represent them, and they are extended by quaternions.  For a given one of these numbers, flipping the sign of the second component in their standard representation yields its conjugate.  If a quadratic polynomial has a negative discriminant, then its roots are of this type.  For 10 points, name these numbers that have real and imaginary components.
