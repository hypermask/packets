answer: {Symphony} No. {8} in F major by Ludwig van Beethoven

The coda to this piece's second movement sees the orchestra play a tutti sixty-fourth note run that destabilizes the steady theme rhythm of the rest of the movement. Gustav Mahler reorchestrated one movement of this piece to make the theme more prominent in the recapitulation, and that movement contains a surprising shift into the submediant key of D instead of the dominant. A forte C-sharp in octaves interrupts the opening pianissimo theme of its final movement. The first and last measures of this composition's first movement are exactly the same, and the fff ("fortiss-issimo") recapitulation eliminates the piano fifth through eighth measures of the opening theme. Its Allegretto movement is followed by a minuet rather than a scherzo, and that second movement's wind rhythms imitate the ticking of the recently invented metronome. The minuet third movement contains a duet for horn and clarinet. The finale of this piece contains forty-five repetitions of the tonic chord of F major. For 10 points, name this shortest of Beethoven's symponies that premiered with Wellington's Victory and the more popular seventh symphony.

answer: {Billy Phelan's Greatest Game}

A minor character in this novel is the author of the novel The Mosquito Lovers as well as the successful play The Flaming Corsage. At the end of this novel, Morrie Berman is arrested while trying to escape to Providence and Honey Curry is killed in Newark during a confrontation with the police. A character in this novel wins $788.85 by betting a three-horse parlay, while another character is temporarily tricked by his lover Angie into thinking the latter is pregnant, so that she can observe his reaction. A reference to events of its author's previous novel can be found in a reminiscence about Emory Jones running the headline "DIAMOND SLAIN BY ENEMIES." In a side plot in this novel, the newspaper columnist Martin Daugherty becomes the lover of Melissa Spencer, who had also been his father's mistress, and in the end, Daugherty salvages the title character's reputation with the O'Rourkes. This work's title may refer to the title character's pool hustling skills, his 668-point bowling victory, or his assistance in unraveling the kidnapping of Charlie McCall while trying to discharge his gambling debt to Daugherty.

answer: {photosystem II} [or P680 before mention; prompt on {photosystem}]

Stress-related inhibition of repairs to this structure is reduced by glycinebetaine, and the serine proteases Deg1 and FTsH are integral to repairing degradation of it. Iron stress repressed RNA reduces the expression of the protein IsiA, which is also known as CP43, in this structure. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria completely lack this complex, whose D1 subunit contains coenzymes like pheophytin. Four manganese ions and a divalent calcium ion form its oxygen evolving complex, where water splitting occurs. Electrons are shuttled to cytochrome b6f by plastoquinol before reaching plastocyanin after passing through this complex, where they are removed from P680 upon antenna pigments' absorption of light in this complex. For 10 points, name this chlorophyll-containing protein complex that is the location of the first step of the light-dependent reactions.

In a paper promoting the TIP5P model of this compound, Mahoney and Jorgensen noted that incorporating terms for flexibility or polarizability does not improve accuracy in modeling its major density anomaly. One of the earliest five-site models of this substance is named for Ben-Naim and Stillinger, and four-site models of this substance place its center of negative charge on a dummy atom and began with the Bernal-Fowler model. Ether is guaranteed free of this compound, when bottled with three or four angstrom molecular sieves, and this compound is removed from reaction mixtures using magnesium and sodium sulfate. This compound reacts with Grignard reagents to give alkanes and forms an azeotrope that is commonly entrained using benzene with ethanol. Such computational models all must take into account its unusually strong hydrogen bonding, which drives up its boiling point to one hundred degrees Celsius. For 10 points, name this compound whose triple point defines the Kelvin scale.

answer: {Gustave Moreau}

This artist's works inspired sonnets from his friend Julian del Casal and his early works include a Portrait of Eugene Lacheurié. He depicted Sappho on the Cliffs, while a figure with a bejeweled sitar holds up a blue flower and sits astride a shrieking multicolored wyvern in his Dream of the Orient. A single head emerging out of the blue and surrounded by a mist of gold and mauve constitutes one of his depictions of Orpheus, while another shows a head in the hands of a Thracian woman. One of his works shows a young man holding the laurel of Apollo above his head, while behind him a female figure holding a sword and hourglass hovers diagonally. That painting, which was dedicated to his master Theodore Chasseriau, was his The Young Man with Death. He was more famous for painting works like Hercules and the Hydra and made a splash at the 1864 salon with his Oedipus and the Sphinx. He also painted a work that shows a half-nude woman pointing at a floating, disembodied head that emanates light. For 10 points, name this painter of The Apparition, who, like Odilon Redon and Puvis de Chavannes, was a major French symbolist.

In one portion of this essay, the author compares the adoption of the calendar to a “time lapse camera” and offers an anecdote about people firing at clock-towers during the July Revolution. This essay quotes Flaubert's statement about sadness being required in order to resuscitate Carthage in a section which chastises scholars'  identifactions with the “victors.” Beginning with an anecdote about the chess-playing robot called the “Turk,” this essay ultimately urges for a conception of the present as the “time of the now” as opposed to merely establishing a “casual connection between various moments” like the “beads of a rosary.” This essay thus ends with a rejection of linear time in favor of “messianic time.” The most remembered portion of this essay deals with of the storm of progress as represented in Klee's painting Angelus Novus. For 10 points, name this essay by Walter Benjamin examining the title academic discipline.

answer: {MOdified Newtonian Dynamics}

In 2010, R. Reyes et al. found that the relativistic form of this theory proposed by Jacob Bekenstein falls outside of the error from comparing galactic distance with E sub g. One alternative to that tensor-vector-scalar generalization of this theory is the f-of-R theory, and this theory originated from changing Poisson's equation by changing the potential function. This theory features a strange function mu of x that approaches x when x  is much less than 1 and approaches 1 when x is much greater than 1. That function makes it so that at one extreme, the square root of a constant a-nought times the gravitational acceleration gives the changed gravitational acceleration predicted by this theory, and recent evidence against this theory has come from observations of the Bullet Cluster. For 10 points, identify this theory proposed by Mordecai Milgrom to account for galactic rotation that competes with Dark Matter and says that acceleration is not proportional to force at low accelerations.

answer: Working {Men's} Party

One branch of this organization was led by the author of the treatise The Rights of Man to Property, Thomas Skidmore, and managed to elect Ebenezer Ford to a state assembly seat on what the Journal of Commerce contemptuously called "the Fanny Wright ticket."  Much of the original organization of this faction was conducted by William Heighton, who had begun holding meetings in Southwark whre he railed against "a system of competition," and through the writings of Stephen Simpson in the Columbian Observer, this party's opposition to the banking system influenced Andrew Jackson. William John Duane, a drafter of this party's anti-bank report, would later become Treasury Secretary under Jackson, and this party's namesake Advocate was published by George Henry Evans. This party had its greatest electoral successes in 1828 in Philadelphia, but following a split in 1833, many members of this party joined the Equal Rights Party, while many of its New York members went over to the Locofocos. Originally created as the political arm of the Mechanics' Union of Trade Associations, for ten points, identify this political party which advocated such reforms as limited working hours and universal malfe suffrage, the first labor-oriented political party in the United States.

The existence of this property was first theorized by Victor Veselago and confirmed in 2000 by John Pendry. Following Pendy, Smith et al. realized this property through the use of a controllable plasma frequency in a double split ring resonator. In a two-dimensional network of LC circuits, this property can be induced in the microwave regime by creating a Poynting vector antiparallel to the wave vector. This property can also be realized by inducing complex Bragg scattering in a photonic crystal, and one application for materials of this property is the construction of superlenses. In materials with this property, the phase and energy velocities move in opposite directions relative to each other, and a material with this property can be created if both the permittivity and the permeability are made to be less than zero. Sometimes known as the "left-handed" property, for ten points, identify this property, present in many metamaterials, in which the direction of the outgoing beam predicted by Snell's Law is reversed.

Three year's during this monarch's rule were known as the Liberal Triennium during which a military coup led by Colonel Rafael Riego ran his nation. This monarch's reactionary policies resulted in the last ten years of his reign being known as “the ominous decade,” and he rescinded the Constitution of 1812 after the aforementioned Triennium was overthrown by French intervention following the Congress of Verona. This ruler's absence during a French occupation led him to be known as “the desired,” and he assumed his throne after forcing the abdication of his father and the dismissal of his rival Manuel de Godoy during the Revolt of Aranjuez. This man's marriage to Maria Cristina of the Two Sicilies and the subsequent birth of his daughter Isabella led him to promulgate his predecessor Charles IV's unpublished revocation of the Salic law in an 1830 Pragmatic Sanction. That resulted in Isabella being crowned queen upon this man's 1833 death against the wishes of his brother.
