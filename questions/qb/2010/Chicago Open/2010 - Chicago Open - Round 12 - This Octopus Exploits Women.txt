answer: {Photorealism}

One artist associated with this movement created the American Alphabet series, while another showed some marbles on a paper in Dream of Love and painted the dark toned “Structures” series. Besides Robert Cottingham and Glennray Tudor, the abdominal areas of lingerie clad women are the favorite subject of one artist in this movement, John Kacere. John Salt's Tree is associated with this movement, as is the polychrome Seated Figure of John DeAndrea. Sculptures like American Athena and Egyptian Rocket Goddess as well as the Marilyn Monroe inspired Vanitas were created by Audrey Flack, while the Tux and Sugar watercolours came out of the work of Ralph Goings. Also associated with the close up portraits of celebrity figures created by Chuck Close, one of its founders is famous for works like Telephone Booth. For 10 points, name this artistic movement associated with Richard Estes, noted for its extremely detailed and accurately rendered paintings.

answer: Bond order

In the ReaxFF model, this quantity is held constant for a given set of angle and torsion terms, and is continuously updated in terms of energy and length.  The IUPAC definition of this quantity gives it as a double sum over the products of the elements of the density matrix and the overlap matrix. Potentials named after this quantity include the Finnis-Sinclair and Tersoff potentials, and this quantity can be experimentally determined as e to the power of the quantity  R sub ij minus d sub ij divided by the constant b, which is approximately 0.353. In organometallic complexes, a reduction of this quantity occurs between a metal and an alkene due to backdonation, according to the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model. Dimolybdenum unusually has a value of 6 for this quantity, while di-tungsten tetra-hpp has a value of four for this quantity between the two tungsten atoms. It can be more easily determined from molecular orbital theory as half the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals and anti-bonding orbitals. For 10 points, name this quantity, which is two for a double bond and three for a triple bond.

answer: Spontaneous {Symmetry Breaking}

In trinification theory, this process results in the transition from SU 3 sub L cross SU 3 sub R to SU 2 cross U 1 over Z 2. The absence of this process in systems with equal to or fewer than two dimensions allows the creation of long-range fluctuations with little energy cost according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem, while in the electroweak interaction this process results in the reduction of the SU 2  cross U 1 group to a U 1 group via the Higgs mechanism, resulting in the creation of W and Z boson mass. Second-order phase transitions display this phenomenon according to Landau, while if this process occurs while the ground state is invariant under the given charge, it results in the creation of Goldstone bosons. For 10 points, name this process in which a system with a particular continuous symmetry enters a state in which said symmetry is no longer present.

answer: {Capitalism}, {Socialism}, and {Democracy}

Part four of this work rejects the Classical Theory of one of the title entities, arguing that politicians do not carry out the will of the people, but rather merely competitively struggle for political power as represented by votes, the author's Procedural Theory of one of the title entities. The first part of this text examines a particular thinker as Sociologist, Economist, Teacher, and Prophet, and is entitled "The Marxian Doctrine". And the second section of this work argues against the fear of monopolies since large companies are forced to innovate to retain their dominance in the market, argues against the idea of “perfect competition”, and famously answers “no it cannot” to its title question: “Can [the first title entity] survive?”. But this book is most famous for discussing how innovation causes existing structures and methods to be replaced by newer ones, the author's concept of “creative destruction”. For 10 points,, this is what magnum opus of Joseph Schumpeter?

answer: {R.K. Narayan} [or {Rasipuram Krishnaswami Iyer Narayanaswami}]

In one of this man's novels, an unnamed journalist meets a man who claims to be a native of “Timbuctoo”, asserts that he is a “futurologist” writing a book on the “Cannibal Plant”, and goes by the name “Dr. Rann”. Another of his protagonists puts his daughter Leela in preschool on the advice of a psychic who also teaches him to contact his dead wife Susila, after having earlier quit his job at Albert Mission College. This author of Talkative Man wrote a novel in which Mali runs away to America and marries Grace, disappointing his candy-vendor father Jagan, as well as a novel whose protagonist helps Daisy set up a number of family-planning clinics using his artistic skills. In addition to The English Teacher, The Vendor of Sweets, and The Painter of Signs, this author's works include a novel about a man who convinces Rosie to walk out on her husband, who he nicknames “Marco Polo”, to become a dancer. That protagonist, Raju, is mistaken for a sadhu and is trapped into fasting in order to end a drought. For 10 points, identify this Indian author of such novels as The Guide and Swami and Friends, which like many of his other works are set in the town of Malgudi.

answer: "The {Sea} and the {Mirror}: A {Commentary} on Shakespeare's The Tempest"

The second section of this work contains a brief interlude in which Adrian and Francisco note that "Good little sunbeams must learn to fly / But it's madly ungay when the goldfish die". This poem takes an Emily Bronte quote asking the "God of Visions" to "tell why I have chosen thee" as its epigraph. Its third section ends by describing the "perfected Work which is not ours", noting that "the sounded note is the restored relation". That third section opens by asking "our so good, so great, so dead author" to take a curtain call, after which it segues into a series of prose monologues spoken by that section's title character in the style of Henry James. It concludes with a "Postscript" whose speaker notes that "we shall become / One evaporating sigh", and features such sections as "The Supporting Cast, Sotto Voce", "The Stage Manager to the Critics", "Caliban to the Audience", and "Prospero to Ariel". For 10 points, identify this long poem, partially in prose, a"commentary on Shakespeare's The Tempest" by W.H. Auden.

answer: {Dryope}

In book ten of the Aeneid, Aeneas kills and refuses to bury a son of Faunus and this figure named Tarquitus. Her son built the town of Oeta, named for and located on the mountain where she served as a shepherdess. Though she married a son of Oxylus, she was impregnated after taking a god disguised as a turtle into her lap, whereupon that god, Apollo, turned into a serpent and raped her. This wife of Andraemon underwent her best-known experience after picking a red lotus blossom to give to her son Amphissus. Unfortunately, picking the flower caused the tree it was on to tremble and bleed, and the tree's blood turned this figure into a black tree as well. For 10 points, identify this playmate of the Hamadryads who, according to Ovid, was turned into a poplar tree.

Alistair Walker developed a fast, space-efficient way to do this process repeatedly known as the method of aliases.   Some common ways of doing this utilize Schrage's multiplication algorithm for increased performance, and a fast method of doing this was developed by Matsumoto and Nishimura. An important paper that showed it was possible to do this effectively for any polynomial-time algorithm was authored by Silvio Micali and Manuel Blum. One method of doing this is named for Blum, Blum, and Shub, and another commonly used method is the Mersenne Twister.  The linear congruence method is a naive way of doing this that involves taking the modulo of a linear relation of the previous result, generally involving large primes.  Performing this process is necessary for Monte Carlo methods or to generate a cryptographic key, and most ways of doing this require input of a seed value.  For 10 points, name this process which should ideally result in a series of unpredictable values.

answer: The United States Presidential Election of {1888}

During this election, Alson Jenness Streeter was the first and only presidential candidate of the Union Labor Party, which came behind Clinton Bowen Fisk who was running for the Prohibition party. The Democratic Party lost much of the Irish vote when it was made known that Sir Lionel Sackville-West, the  British Ambassador, had suggested that the Democratic candidate better represented British interests, in the Murchison Letter. The incumbent's running mate was Allen Granberry Thurman, who replaced his vice president, Adlai E. Stevenson, and the winner's running mate, Levi Morton, may have helped the winner carry the incumbent's home state of New York. This marked the third time in history, and first time since 1876, that a candidate won without winning the popular vote. FTP, this is what election in which the incumbent Democract, Grover Cleveland, was defeated by Republican, Benjamin Harrison?

answer: War of the {Polish} Succession

One theater of this war was decided by a protracted siege executed in turn by Peter Lacy and by Marshal Münnich, and that engagement is notable for seeing this first historical fighting between Russian and French troops.  A young Maurice de Saxe fought in this conflict despite the opposing side being led by his half-brother.  Spain was drawn into this conflict by the newly signed Treaty of the Escorial, and after this conflict Tuscany was granted to Francis Stephen in recompense for the French seizure of his Duchy of Lorraine.  Victory at Bitonto in this war allowed Don Carlos to invade Sicily and claim it as a Bourbon possession, and an attempted relief of the Siege of Philippsburg was conducted by Eugene of Savoy, who led his final campaigns in this war.  The Treaty of Vienna ended this conflict, though its major belligerents, France and Austria, would fight again two years later in the War of the Austrian Succession.  For 10 points, name this war of the 1730s which pitted Frederick Augustus II of Saxony against Stanislaw Leszczynsky for the right to the crown of Augustus the Strong.

answer: String {Quintet}({s}) [prompt on “{quintet}”; do NOT accept “{Piano Quintet}”; accept “{Viola Quintet}” before “{Schubert}”, {though} I {doubt anyone's daft enough} to {say} that]

Ralph Vaughan Williams' sole work of this type adopts Baroque forms for its third movement Alla Sarabanda and its Burlesca finale, and is subtitled “Phantasy”. Mozart's works for this ensemble are his only chamber works to have an entire chapter devoted to them in Charles Rosen's The Classical Style, which claims that his K. 515 was the largest-scale use of sonata form before Beethoven. K.515 also inspired Schubert's sole work in this genre, his final instrumental work, notably flattens the fifth in the dominant of its final V-I cadence, thereby ending with the notes D flat-C. But the most famous selection from a work in this genre is the A major minuet from one of over a hundred works for this ensemble written by Luigi Boccherini. For 10 points, this is what kind of work that supplements a string quartet with an extra viola or cello?

answer: {Ruddigore} [or The {Witch's Curse}]

In this work, the protagonists and chorus conclude that winter is the best season in the madrigal “When the buds are blossoming”, which appears in the Act I finale of this work. The female protagonist is an orphan who sings of her devotion to her etiquette book in “If somebody there chanced to be”, and is pursued by a character who is told about the “spectre's holiday” when the ghost of his grandfather, Sir Roderic, steps out of its portrait to sing “When the night wind howls”. In its most famous number, three characters declare that their “particularly rapid, unintelligible patter / isn't generally heard, and if it is it doesn't matter.”  In this spoof of the Gothic fiction craze, the patter trio “My eyes are fully open” is sung by Mad Margaret alongside the cursed Despard and Robin. The title castle is owned by members of the Murgatroyd family in, for 10 points, what comic opera by Gilbert and Sullivan?

Derek Parfit developed the terms “agent-relative” and “agent-neutral” to describe this philosopher's ideas, and this man developed a model of action that says that if a predicate R is true of an action A, then R constitutes a “reason” for a person to “promote” A.  One work by this man replies to Bernard William's rejection of an impersonal morality in its section “Living Right and Living Well,” and in that work this author joins with David Chalmers in promoting a dual aspect theory of the mind.  That work by this man attempts to reconcile the inherently subjective nature of a philosopher's viewpoint with the titular objective stance and is titled, The View from Nowhere.  Another work by this author posits the existence of facts unknowable by humans and imagines a Martian without concept of visual perception that still understands the physical phenomena of lightning.  That work rejects reductionist explanations of the mind-body problem due to the inherently subjective nature of consciousness, using the example of understanding the experiences of an animal that perceives the world through echolocation.  For 10 points, name this NYU philosopher, the author of “What is it Like to be a Bat?”

answer: {Vinteuil's Violin Sonata} in F-sharp [{Interesting idea} -{EM}]

Reynaldo Hahn claimed that the most celebrated moment of this piece was suggested by a passage in Saint-Saens' work of the same genre in D minor, and its creator noted in his dedication to Jacques de Lacretelle that the tremolos that precede that passage were inspired by the Prelude to Lohengrin. Themes from this work are quoted and developed in the same composer's later Septet, which its creator admitted was modeled on Franck's String Quartet, and which was discovered after the composer's death by his daughter's lesbian lover, who had proposed spitting on his portrait in an earlier scene of the work in which this piece appears. That Septet receives a notable performance by an ensemble including Charles Morel in the salon of the Verdurin's, the same location where the “little phrase” from this piece first makes its impression on a character that interprets it as the “national anthem” of his love for Odette Crécy, Charles Swann. FTP, this is what fictional piece of chamber music that features prominently in Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time?

This author noted that "commodious or cramped" paragraphs come to resemble Paris, Texas rather than Paris, France in an essay that also discourses on the auditory qualities of a line from Dickens's David Copperfield. He wrote a story about a man who has "sailed the seas and come..." to a town called B, where that man writes poems about elderly figures like Billy Holsclaw and envies his cat, Mr. Tick, for his affinity with nature. This author of "The Sentence Seeks Its Form" wrote a novel whose protagonist creates the imaginary "Party for Disappointed People" and fills antique furniture with dirt while hiding pages of the introduction to the book Guilt and Innocence in Hitler's Germany. The first novel by this creator of William Frederick Kohler is partly narrated by Jethro Furber and Israbestis Tott and sees Henry Pimber hang himself after learning that he can never acquire the title quality of its protagonist, Brackett. For 10 points, identify this author of A Temple of Texts and "In the Heart of the Heart of the Country", who won an American Book Award for The Tunnel and also penned Omensetter's Luck.

One conflict at this council centered on the replacement of the words “we decree and declare” with “we are willing and content” in a certain document.  The final phase of this council featured the orations of Isidor of Kiev and Bessarion, while its early stages were presided over by Giuliano Caesarini.  Enea Silvio Piccolomini was an important persona at this council, though in its aftermath he renounced many of its goals with the bull “Execrabilis” as the new Pope Pius II.  Agreements reached due to this council include the Concordat of Vienna and the Compact of Prague, which reconciled the pope with the German church and the Hussites respectively, and the late stages of this council saw the declaration “Laetentur Coeli” during the attendance of John Palaeologus, resulting in an apparent reconciliation of Catholic and Orthodox churches.  The bull “Doctoris Gentium” moved this council to Ferrara, after which a rump council elected Amadeus VIII of Savoy as antipope Felix V.  This council was mediated by Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, and it was convoked soon before the death of Martin V.  For 10 points, name this council which featured fierce contention between Eugenius IV and the conciliarists, and which was begun in Switzerland twelve years after the Council of Constance.

answer: {Nonsense}-{Mediated Decay} [or {NMD}; prompt on {mRNA surveillance}]

The levels of PIKK complexes in this process are upregulated by RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 binding to the protein kinase SMG-1.  UPF1, 2, and 3 are key to triggering this process, which is facilitated by a complex containing Y14, RNPS1 and Magoh. It's not ubiqutination, but this pathway has been shown to modulate the phenotypic severity of Von Hippel-Lindau disease by allowing some frameshifts to escape but others to remain stable, and evolutionarily it facilitates intron gain by correcting some forms of weak splicing. Ribosomal stalling leads to recruitment of eRF1 and 3 in this process, which is facilitated by the exon junction complex, leading to the formation of the SURF complex and eventual degredation of the substrate. For 10 points, name this form of mRNA surveillance that triggers RNA degradation in the presence of premature stop codons.
