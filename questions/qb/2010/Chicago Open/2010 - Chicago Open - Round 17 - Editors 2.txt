answer: {going} to the {moon} [accept {logical} equivalents]

A Vassily Aksyonov short story about Kirpichenko's love for a flight attendant is titled after doing this halfway. This action provides half of the title of a 1923 collection of poems by Richard Aldington, and in the title of a Svatopluk Cech novel later adapted into an opera by Janacek, Mr. Broucek performs this action. In Lucian of Samosata's A True History, this action is accomplished by the means of a magic whirlwind, and in his satirical poem "Ignatius His Conclave," Donne suggests that the Jesuits should do this, possibly with the aid of some "new Glasses." In a story by Italo Calvino, the Deaf One and Qfwfq perform this action every month, while Astolpho does this to retrieve Roland's lost reason in The Castle of Crossed Destinies. In The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Munchausen performs this action twice, once in Chapter VI with Turkey-beans to retrieve a silver hatchet and again in Chapter XVIII when his ship is tossed by a whirlwind. In a Clifford Odets play, Mr. Prince urges Ben to do this with a rocket, and it was also done with the help of Impey Barbicane's calculations and a cannon called "the Columbiad" in a Jules Verne novel. For ten points, identify this action which involves visiting a nearby celestial body.

answer: {adaptive optics}

This technique was first proposed by Horace Babcock, and this technique allows systems to approach the Fried coherence limit. Fried and Greenwood also derived the bandwidth limit for systems that implement this technique, which can correct one Zernike mode per actuator. One operation necessary for performing this technique is accomplished through the use of the Shack-Hartmann procedure; that operation is wavefront sensing. This technique relies on the presence of a guide star as well as the object to be imaged and a fast-steering mirror which removes aberrations induced by the tilt. The use of this technique allows large mirrors to achieve diffraction-limited imaging. For ten points, identify this experimental technique which utilizes a deformable mirror to remove phase distortions induced by atmospheric turbulence.

answer: {Rerum Novarum} or {New} Things

A response to this document established the “principle of subsidiary function” in trying to find a “middle way” and this document's author was greatly influenced by the corporatist Fribourg Union and the teachings of Wilhelm von Ketteler. The 22nd section of this work notes that “a most strict account must be given to the Supreme Judge for all we possess,” and 59th section argues that mutual associations among Catholics are beneficial to the state. It mentions a “dictate of natural justice more imperious and ancient” than bargains between men and cites Thomas Aquinas' On the Governance of Rulers to support notions of distributive justice. This religious document, issued just before the encyclical Inter innumeras, argues that socialists, who would “set aside the parent... act against natural justice and destroy the structure of the home,” but acknowledges that employers are obligated to pay a fair wage. Issued by a man known as the Workers' Pope, for ten points, identify this encyclical concerned with the “rightful duties of capital and labor,” issued by Leo XIII.

answer: {Burlingame} Treaty or the Treaty of {Tientsin}

One of the provisions of this agreement would later be renegotiated in the Angell Treaty, and this treaty was negotiated when its namesake was sent back to his home nation as a good will ambassador. The fourth article of this treaty specified a mutual respect for cemeteries, and that article also specified that the citizens of both nations party to this treaty would be free from religious persecution. This treaty's eighth article demanded that one signatory provide protections for engineers, but nevertheless disclaimed “intervention by one nation in the affairs... of another,” and disavowed any right to intervene in regard to the construction of railroads and other improvements. This treaty contained a provision providing one nation with most-favored-nation status, which led to fears of unlimited immigration from that country. For ten points, identify this 1868 treaty negotiated between the United States and China by its namesake.

answer: Last {Judgment}

John Martin's Romantic version shows two rivers emptying into a canyon with radiant white angels in the background. The almoners of Antwerp commissioned a triptych on this theme by Barend van Orley, while a Romanesque depiction of it is on the west tympanum of the cathedral at Saint-Lazare and was created by Gislebertus. Lucas van Leyden's version shows the gaping maw of a massive fish on the right wing, while another depiction shows Christ resting his feet on a golden globe as he sits on a rainbow. That version centrally shows St. Michael in the vestiments of a priest as he weighs two men and is the Beaune Altarpiece of Rogier van der Weyden. The most famous depiction of is believed to contain the artist's self-portrait in the flayed skin held by Saint Bartholomew and earned complaints of indecency from Biagio da Cesena, since it depicts a group of nude figures in the sky. For 10 points, name this scene depicted on the western wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel.

answer: {vaults} [or {vault} organelles; or {vault} cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein]

P-glycoprotein upregulates these complexes to facilitate the proliferation of dendritic cells, and one of their protein constituents has been found to associate with and regulate multiple growth- and transcription-related proteins, such as PTEN and c-Jun. One protein that makes up these complexes also catalyzes telomere addition to the ends of chromosomes and is called TEP1. They can be mobilized along microtubules to associate with the nuclear envelope, giving credence to the theory that they may be involved in intracellular transport processes. Ninety-six copies of their major protein constituent self-assemble into a barrel-like structure, although these organelles can also open into an octahedral flower-like configuration. These organelles' internal RNA molecules bind argonaute proteins and may mediate drug resistance in cancer cells. For 10 points, name these highly conserved cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein organelles of 39-fold symmetry and uncertain function.

answer: {Delmore Schwartz}

This writer received some exposure when some of his early works were included in Mary Wrinn's The Hollow Reed, and his only dramatic work is the verse play Shenandoah. In one story by this writer, Belmont returns to the titular country from Paris and listens to the story of the Baumann family, while another story opens with a nameless narrator who dreams that he is in a theater watching a Sunday afternoon in 1909. In addition to "America! America!" and "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities," this writer's other stories are collected in The World is a Wedding, and he chronicled the divorce of his parents in the poem Genesis. A quotation from Whitehead about "the withness of the body" prefaces his poem about a "heavy animal" with "a manifold of honey to smear his face," "The Heavy Bear Who Goes With Me," while "Reflected headlights slowly slid the wall," in the titular location of one of his poems entitled "In the naked bed, in Plato's cave." The poet of works compiled in such collections as Vaudeville for a Princess and Summer Knowledge for ten points, identify this Jewish poet whose life was the basis for Saul Bellows' Humboldt's Gift, and to whom John Berryman dedicated his Dream Songs.

One part of this work was filmed with custom-made green filters intended to evoke thoughts of urine. One character in this work makes his last appearance when he watches the doctor Roman try to commit suicide by skiing off an embankment after discovering his impotency and encouraging his wife to take a lover. The former character was earlier seen navigating a boat to a shore where a girl debates opening a letter; that girl later weeps until she realizes her father had merely gone out for milk and then reveals how she had planned to seduce him. The first part closes with a man entering a church after he learns that his computer's calculation about the weight threshold of ice has failed and that his son Pawel has drowned. Artur Barcis plays various anonymous characters in all but the last section, and a namesake housing project is a central location throughout this work. For 10 points, name this collection of one hour films based on the Commandments, a creation of Krzysztof Kie?lowski.

At the end of this work, after searching for Tom Collins ingredients, the narrator notes that after an ounce of whisky he either gets violently sick or starts scanning the room for unbelievers, and a child in a photograph is later identified as Charlotte Mayhew. At the beginning of this story, the narrator is misidentified as Dickie Briganza, and at the end, the narrator takes a diary out of a laundry hamper, in which the diarist notes that he has been reading "a miscellany of Vedanta all day;" this occurs after guests such as the Lieutenant and Mrs. Silsburn leave the narrator's appartment. This story takes its title from a line from one of Sappho's bridal songs, and the titular phrase is later discovered by its narrator on a bathroom mirror as a message from his sister Boo Boo, who claims to outrank everyone on this block and who, like the narrator and his brother appeared on "It's a Wise Child." For ten points, identify this story in which Buddy attends a wedding that has to be called off because his brother doesn't show up to marry Muriel, and which is often published together with Seymour, an Introduction.

answer: {Peace} of {Passarowitz} or {Pozarevac}

This agreement was signed under pressure from Sir Edward Wortley Montagu and Count Jacob Colijer, and a commercial component of this treaty included the formation of an "Eastern Company," for the purposes of trade in Trieste. In the war which preceded the signing of this agreement, one side had won naval victories at the battles of Cape Matapan and Cerigo, and that conflict was begun partly through the instigations of the Chief Black Eunuch. The territory ceded by one party to this treaty would be gained back by the Treaty of Belgrade; that territory included Belgrade itself, Temesvar, and Northern Wallachia. Following its entry into a war to prevent Venice from collapse, the Austrian won a decisive victory at Petrovaradin, in which Silahadar Pasha was killed, leading to the signing of this treaty. Reflecting the gains made by Austria under the leadership of Eugene of Savoy, for ten points, identify this July 1718 treaty signed between Austria and the Ottomans in the namesake Serbian town.

answer: {Aesthetics}: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism

In a 1980 postscript to this work, its author claimed that he didn't want to get involved in definitional questions, citing the work of Paul Ziff and Morris Weitz in support of that decision. In a section on "The Analysis of Fictional Sentences," this work cites the Falsity theory and the descriptive theory of Russell, before explicating what he calls the "nonpredication theory," put forth by P.F. Strawson. Recalling how he once made up the expression "laminated government," in a class, the author of this work provides a chart which illustrates four theories of metaphors. The "performatory," "emotive," and "relativistic" theories are explicated in a late section of this work titled "The Nature of Critical Argument," while completeness and coherence are held to be the components of unity in another section, which provides examples such as Las Meninas and the third Brandenburg Concerto. This work is divided into 12 sections including "The Literary Work," "The Meaning of Music," and "Artistic Truth." Subtitled "Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism," for ten points, identify this magnum opus of Monroe Beardsley on the philosophy of art.

A formula according to Bott gives a way of calculating these values on holomorphic vector spaces and the calculation of these values is used in the Mellin transform. The ability to calculate these values is necessary for performing an inverse Laplace transform, as knowing these values allows one to evaluate the Browich integral. If a function of z is expanded in a Laurent series around a point z-nought, then this value is given by the coefficient of the term “one over z minus z-nought,” and another definition of this quantity is given via the clockwise contour integral of the function around the non-removable singularity. For ten poitns, idetnify this value which is given by its namesake theorem when a complex-valued function is integrated around a contour that encloses a pole.

answer: Abu {Jafar al}-{Mansur}

Though frequently noted in the Anghani for his interest in poetry and stinginess to poets who praised other rulers, this man once allowed ibn Harma to indulge his love of wine. His insufficiently extreme religious views incited the assassination attempt of the messianic Rawandiya cult, and during his reign, the anti-Arab and pro-Persian Shu'ubiyya movement began. Also noted for being the first caliph to commission translations of the Sindhind and the Almagest into Arabic, this ruler earlier defeated the Zoroastrian revivalist movement of Sunbadh, whose rebellion was in response to this man's murder of his ally from Khorasan, Abu Muslim. He came to power after the death of his brother al-Saffah and was noted for his hostility to Alids and Shiites. He was succeeded by his son al-Mahdi and he moved the capital of the caliphate to a city where the House of Wisdom would be built. For 10 points, name this ruler known for establishing the capital at Baghdad during his reign as the second caliph of the Abbasids.

This character has sex in an attic with a Jewish orchestra director named Thomas whose Polish family members have all been exterminated. She attempts to induce a miscarriage by immersing herself in a scalding hot bath and jumping off a table after her abrupt marriage to a man who only takes her out of the house to attend “sundowners” with his friends from the Sports Club. Earlier in the book that concludes with her marriage to Douglas Knowell, she argues with her brother Jonathan about the political and social acceptability of two Jewish shopkeepers' sons from whom she has always borrowed books, Solly and Joss Cohen. This character, who grows up on a farm in Africa, is annoyed by Mrs. Van Rensberg's comparison of her to the more fashionable Marnie in a novel named for her that appears in a series along with books like Landlocked and A Proper Marriage. For 10 points, name this woman, the title character of the first novel in Doris Lessing's Children of Violence series.

answer: {Dichterliebe} [or The {Poet's Love}]

The theme of the opening section of this composition revolves around a D-C sharp-B-A sequence, while John Daverio's Crossing Paths skewers Eric Sams' cryptographic argument that this work is among those by its composer to utilize variations on a C-B-A-G sharp-A sequence. This composition's instrumental postlude quotes both “Der Mond komt still gegangen” and “Am leuchtenden Sommermorgen,” and in the twelfth song of this work flowers instruct the narrator not to be angry with their sister and call him a “sad, pale man.” This work, whose composer dedicated it to Wilhemine Schroder-Devrient, adds textual repetitions in only one movement, Ich grolle nicht. The last word of this work falls on a half-diminished chord, and the climax of its Aus alten Marchen song has been described as a conflict between this composer's artistic personalities Florestan and Eusebius. For 10 points, name this song cycle consisting of 16 settings of Heinrich Heine poems, written by Robert Schumann.

Former members of this group include a man who wrote a critique of cognitivism called The Mind's Provisions, and another who wrote a book on Paratexts and had an English selection of his works published as Narrative Discourse. Their magazine published two dissenting articles by Anton Pannekoek, and one of its founders broke with this group to create the ILO and ICO. They were inspired by the work of Raya Dunayevskaya and C.L.R James in the United Stastes as embodied in the Johnson-Forrest Tendency. This group's two central members argued the Soviet Union was merely “bureaucratic capitalism” under the pseudonyms Chaulieu and Montal, and one member of that pair was the author of The Imaginary Institution in Society. The Situationists were influenced by Guy Debord's time with this group, which had more or less dissolved by 1965. For 10 points, name this group of French libertarian socialists created by Claude Lefort and Cornelius Castoriadis, whose name could be construed as a question.

answer: {beta hydride elimination}

Ye and Gellman studied the transition state of this reaction as conducted with fluoroalkanes on platinum (111) surfaces. Because the rate of this process is minimized, styrene polymerization proceeds most quickly in solvents with proper dielectric constant from four to four point two. This process may be prevented by employing trans-spanning ligands to prevent open cis sites from becoming available, or by the use of neopentyl ligands. This process accounts for the potential migration of double bonds in the Heck reaction and proceeds by the migration of a ligand hydrogen to the metal as the metal-ligand bond is pushed into a double bond. For 10 points, name this process in transition metal catalysis, wherein the departure of an H- (“H” minus) results in an alkene.

Despite reservations about reform legislation, this man pushed through the Municipal Corporations Act that established an eighteen person royal commission, and the public pressure of a large trade-union petition caused the pardoning of the Tolpuddle martyrs during this man's second term as Prime Minister. He had been elected to that term despite William IV's earlier dismissal largely because his party united with Daniel O'Connell in the Litchfield House Compact. His lady problems included being accused of having an affair with Caroline Norton, thought it was Queen Victoria's approbation that allowed this man to stay in office after the Bedchamber Crisis caused Peel to turn down the office of Prime Minister. The most famous piece of legislation this man's administration pushed was based on a report issued by Edwin Chadwick and forced each parish to join a union that met the principle of less eligibility.

One legend about this figure holds that the last thing he did before dying was build a cathedral, after which he turned into a stone that was used to complete the building. Another story about this figure relates that he could not walk until he was 33 years old, at which point his ailment was cured by a group of pilgrims. This figure's horse was able to leap the Black Mire in a single leap, and this figure defeated a half-man-half-bird bandit named the Nightingale. In another incident, this figure rode to a place called the Holy Mountains to test his strength against the giant Sviatogor, who trapped this figure in his pocket. This hero's horse was variously named either Sivushka or Kosmatushka, and the pilgrims who healed him told him never to face Volga Yaroslavich or Mikula Selyaninovich in battle. This man presented himself at the court of Vladimir Bright Sun, where he became a member of a group that also included Dobrynya Nikitich and Alesha Popovich.

answer: The {God} that {Failed}

One essay in this collection argues that “what the world needs is a balance of economic and political power so that no party... no government is omnipotent.” Another essay in this collection relates the author's conversations with a man who was pseudonymized as “Chalmers” by Christopher Isherwood, and that essay concludes that “the interests of [those] who care for the value of freedom must be identified with those of the many who need bread.” The author of that essay in this collection, who had previously published a work entitled Forward From Liberalism, was the poet Stephen Spender. Yet another work in this collection, which is divided into two sections entitled “The Initiates,” and “Worshippers from Afar,” is partly concerned with the trial of John Ross, and was written by Richard Wright. Probably the most famous essay in this collection begins “A faith is not acquired by reasoning,” and was written by a man who had planned to write a book called The Soviet Land through Bourgeois Eyes, and later wrote a work about two different ways of coping with the world, “The Yogi and the Commissar.” Collected and edited by Richard Crossman and Arthur Koestler, for ten points, identify this collection of essays detailing various intellectuals' disillusion with communism.
