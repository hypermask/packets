answer: {Marie} de {Médicis} [or {Maria} de' {Medici}]

This person's advisors included Claude Maugis, who commissioned a notable commemoration of the highly favorable Treaty of Angouleme, and a court favorite whom Charled d'Albert de Luynes had assasinated, Concino Concini, Marquis d'Ancre. An ill-advised flight from Compiegne led to this ruler dying destitute following earlier confinements at Blois and Angers. The way was cleared for this daughter of Joanna of Austria through a divorce of Marguerite de Valois. The Day of the Dupes saw her fail to oust Cardinal Richelieu, to whom she lost control over her son. The dedicatee of the Palais de Luxembourg, for 10 points, name this mother and regent of Louis XIII and second wife of Henry IV, a member of a famous Tuscan family.

answer: Providence

One character in this film realizes that something in childhood has gone wrong, but that he can't spend the rest of his life attributing it to the “search for a moral language.” That character is called his own best friend by Sonia, whose life with him consists of establishing minimal friction; they tell each other “we would make love if we had the desire, and we would blow each other's brains out if we had a gun.” The protagonist is given the gifts of Hemingway's knife and the book The Scales of Time for his birthday. He later sees a man worrying about what is infinitely small and infinitely large and asking the barrister “Did you create hell all these years just to have something to write about?” Kevin Woodford is tried for murder, and later has an affair with Sonia, while Claude Langham, played by Dirk Bogarde, goes for his old flame, the slowly dying Helen. The alcoholic protagonist continues to refuse to die until he finishes who has been writing his treacherous family into his latest novel. An exploration of discontinuous perspective akin to the discontinuous time in the director's previous work, Last Year at Marienbad, for 10 points, name this film starring Sir John Gielgud as a dying writer, a work by Alain Resnais.

answer: {conformational isomers} [or {conformers}; accept {rotamers} until it's mentioned and prompt on it afterwards]

One of the common sub-instances of these entities is stabilized by hyperconjugative donation from a sigma-C-H orbital into the substituent antibonding orbital, its namesake “effect,” and is named for the presence of substituents with bond angles between 30 and 90 degrees; another has substituents atop one another in the relevant Newman projection and, while generally unstable, can cause disequilibrium among its stable relatives if its activation energy is too high. Cases in which this type of isomer can occur are limited by the fact that pi bonds disallow longitudunal twists in general, so it requires the presence of formal sigma bonds. The aforementioned instances of these are the gauche and eclipsed ones. The simplest class of these is defined by orientation about a single sigma bond and is the rotamers. For 10 points, name this category of stereoisomers that are interconverted between by rotations about single bonds.

answer: {Heartbreak House}

One character in this play vows to “discover a ray mightier than any X-ray, a mind ray that will explode the ammunition in the belt of” his adversary, when his daughter suggests inventing a harpoon canon to destroy the population of Europe. Although the numbskull Hastings never appears on stage, his brother Randall arrives to keep an eye on his wife. However, Randall does little but play the flute while Addy flirts with the good-for-nothing Hector, whom Ellie Dunn believes is Marcus Darnley. The 7th degree of concentration of Captain Shotover turns out to be rum, which leads to everyone sitting around waiting to be annihilated during a bomb raid. Called a “fantasia in the Russian manner on English themes,” for 10 points, name this play that centers on the dual of Horseback Hall; a George Bernard Shaw play about some boarders.

The story on which this section of a larger work is built is the solution of a murder following a dispute between Moses and his followers about a sacrifice. One particularly oft-repeated part of this section is theKursi or Throne Verse, which is commonly used as a prayer before sleep. This chapter contains the earliest discussion of the haughtiness of Iblis, but is mainly devoted to such practical matters as the terms of divorce and standards of financial reporting, the subject of its 282nd ayat, which is the longest in the book in which it appears. At 286 ayats, it is itself the longest section of that book. For 10 points, name this longest Sura of the Koran that gets its common name from the animal sacrificed by the Israelites.

answer: the {action} [prompt on {S}]

The weight of a path in a Feynman path integral is given by e to the i over h-bar times this variable for the path. So-called angles named for this quantity have conjugate momenta given by the closed path integral of a naive momentum with respect to its conjugate coordinate. Hamilton's characteristic function is given by total energy times time plus this quantity. The Euler equations of motion for a system are derived by applying a variational statement relevant to this quantity; that statement is Hamilton's principal, according to which this quantity is stationary with respect to a particle's path. For 10 points, name this quantity, the time integral of the Lagrangian, which is classically minimized for a system's path.

answer: As I lay with {my head} in your {lap}, {Camerado}

At the end of this work, the narrator concludes that he does not know whether "we shall be victorious, or utterly quel'd and defeated," and midway through notes that "the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me." This work's narrator knows that he is "restless and makes other so," and describes his own words as "weapons full of danger, full of death," with which the narrator confronts "peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle them." Following this poem's title line, the narrator says, "The confession I made I resume - what I said to you in the open air I resume," and this poem concludes with the confession that the narrator has urged the titular individual "onward with me, without the least idea of our destination." Found in its author's collection of civil war poems, Drum Taps, for ten points, identify this Walt Whitman poem with a homosexual subtext in which the narrator describes being held by the titular comrade-in-arms.

Though it is not in Spain, this municipality is home to a soccer team called Barcelona, operators of thesecond-largest stadium on its continent, the Estadio Monumental. This city serves as its nation's main seaport, lying as it does a namesake gulf on the Pacific coast, hence its nickname, the Pearl of the Pacific. One of Latin America's best airports is this city's José Joaquín de Olmedo International. A monument in this city takes the form of a semi-circular arcade with end pillars surmounted by vultures and on which fly the flags of nine different South American nations – that monument commemorates an 1822 meeting between Bolivar and San Martín that took place here. For 10 points, name this city of about 3 million on the Guayas River, the largest city in Ecuador.

answer: a {comparator}

One type of these with one input is symbolized by a triangle labeled with a hysteresis loop and was created to model squid nerve propagation; that one can be implemented by operating a tunnel diode near its inversion voltage or by grounding the inverting input of an op-amp and connecting the input signal to the non-inverting input with positive feedback. A simple but unreliable two-input one of these can be created by connecting an op-amp's inputs to the input signals with no feedback. The input quantization stage of an ADC is a parallel set of these with different reference levels, so one on its own functions as a one-bit ADC. For 10 points, name this type of circuit, the output of which switches between two states with the relative size of it input and which can thus be said to check the size of its input.

Epistemological coherentism is characterized by a rejection of the claim that this specific type of statement is necessarily false. Agrippa's trilemma is the claim that all proofs are fundamentally axiomatic, regressive, or this. Parts 5 and 16 of Book II of the Prior Analytics discuss this type of statement, the latter part noting that this occurs for negative syllogisms when the predicates denied for a given subject are identical. The simplest form of this error occurs when a syllogism's conclusion is derived from one, not both, of its premises. For 10 points, name this fallacy that occurs more generally when a conclusion is the same as one of the premises used to prove it.

answer: The {Fourth} Crusade

A force motivating one side in this clash was a student of Peter Chanter, the organizer of a meeting at Écry. A first-hand account of this conflict is the so-called Conquest by another organizer of that same side, Geoffrey of Villehardouin. One motivating factor in the eventual shape of this war was a large-scale massacre perpetrated 20 years earlier by groups celebrating the coup of Andronicus I. Galvanized by Fulk of Nueilly, the aggressors in this war were led first by Thibault of Champagne and then by Bonifaceof Montferrat, who joined with Enrico Dandolo in contravening Innocent III's letter on this campaign by attacking Zara. For 10 points, name this war that ended with the foundation of the Latin Kingdoms after Western Christian knights and Venetians sacked Constantinople in 1204.

answer: {rhodopsin}

An algal form of this molecule tagged with a Venus reporter has been used by the Svoboda group to map layer 2 and 3 callosal projections. Stability of its active intermediate form depends on protonation of a conserved glutamine residue that forms a salt bridge with a conserved arginine residue, as well as the transfer of a proton from a Schiff base linkage with lysine to another glutamine residue. Arrestin binds its phosphorylated domain to deactivate it, and at high calcium concentrations, recoverin inhibits its kinase. Its activation of the G protein transducin allows a phosphodiesterase to hydrolyze cyclic GMP, closing sodium-calcium channels to hyperpolarize the cell. It is broken down in the pigment epithelium and reconverted to a complex including an 11-cis form in the outer segment disks. One of its subunits selects for its spectrum; the other is a chromophore made of an aldehyde of vitamin A. Converting to all-trans form when a photon hits, for 10 points, name this photopigment found in rods.

This man's dedication to improving the state of his nation's army led him to compose a Soldier's Pocket Book for Field Service, which aided in his promotion to assistant adjutant general. His service under James Hope Grant is recounted in this man's Narrative of the War with China in 1860, and the seizure of the Trent prompted this man to be sent to Canada, where he led the Red River expedition in suppression of the Riel rebellion. This man's more famous deeds were carried out in the East, where he led the expedition that destroyed Kumasi and won a victory at Tall al-Kabir against Urabi Pasha. This man's forces arrived too late to save “Chinese” Gordon at Khartoum, but for his efforts he was mad viscount anyway, and as commander-in-chief of all British forces he prosecuted the First Boer War. For ten points, identify this well-traveled British general, whose exploits include bringing the Zulu War to an end and a punitive expeditiong against the Ashanti empire.
