answer: {Adolph Strecker}

Masquelin and Hulme followed the Ugi reaction with this reaction in order to demonstrate three-center four- and five-component reaction systems, and Cal Tech's Stanley Miller performed a spark-catalyzed version of this reaction for several weeks, with the addition, in some vessels, of ferrous ammonium sulfate. One reaction named for this scientist sees the iodide-catalyzed formation of sulfonates by alkylating ammonium sulfites. Another reaction named for this man was turned into a hydantoin synthesis by Bucherer and Bergs by using additional carbon dioxide; in that reaction, an imine forms, which is attacked by a cyanide ion and subsequently is hydrolyzed; that process was mentioned by Miller and Urey in the context of their experiment simulating early-Earth conditions. For 10 points, name this chemist who gives his name to a synthesis of amino acids.

answer: {Eusebius} of {Caesarea}

The fourth book of one this historian's works closes by discussing Bardesanes and his dialogue On Fate, before noting how Soter died, while another part of that work discusses a period of misrule in which figures like the brothers Adesius and Apphianus both died at the hands of mobs. He was the manager of the Augustus's purple making factory while in Tyre, where he met Pamphilus, his collaborator with him on a defense of Origen. He sent the emperor a copy of his treatise on the Paschal Festival, which led to his stringent correspondence with Copnstantia. His most notable work contains an appendix on the martyrs of Palestine, and begins by stating how he is writing an account of the holy apostles. For 10 points, name this man that delivered the opening address to Constantine at the Council of Nicaea, a father of the church known for his church histories.

answer: {Abraham} De {Moivre}

In 1860, Gompertz modified a law named for this man by changing his equation to a ten parameter equation. That law named for him has recently been modified by Di Pino and Pirri and expresses the natural logarithm of a quotient of ages as a set of polynomials. In addition to formulating a one parameter survival function useful in actuarial science, a theorem named for him and Laplace allows us to approximate a sum of n binomial random variables as normal when n is sufficiently large. He also names a set of complex number ones that equal one when raised to a given degree. His most notable treatise influenced the namesake of Bayes's theorem and is The Doctrine of Chances. For 10 points, name this mathematician, whose namesake formula equates the nth power of cosine x and i times sin x with cosine of nx plus i times sin of nx.

Casadesus and Szell worked with the Cleveland Orchestra to record a number of these works, whose “dream andantes” were the subject of comment by Cuthbert Girdlestone. Johann Christian Bach's overture to La Calamita de Couri is quoted in No. 12 in A major, while No. 18 in B-flat major was possibly written for the blind Maria Theresa von Paradis. Charles Rosen argued the ninth in E flat major was the first mature work of the classical style, while the seventh in F was originally composed for three solo instruments and is called "Lodron." A "Romance" second movement marks No. 20 in D minor, while No. 23 in A major features an F-sharp minor Adagio in 6/8 time for its second movement. No. 26 is distinctly incomplete and known as "Coronation" and No. 21 in C major is nicknamed "Elvira Madigan." For 10 points, name these 27 works in a certain genre by the composer of Don Giovanni.

One of these conflicts began when a local leader signed the Treaty of Surat, ceding the territories of Salsette and Bassein, though those territories were gained back in the Treaty of Wadgaon. Another of these conflicts began with the military victory of Yashwantrao Holkar, though that leader remained neutral while his allies, the Scindia and Bhonsle, were crushed at Laswari by Lord Lake. The third and final conflict of this name had as its pretext the capture of the robber bands known as the Pathans and Pindaris and ended with total victory for Lord Hastings, who had earlier supported the puppet Peshwas Raghunath Rao and Baji Rao II in the previous conflicts. For 10 points, name this series of three wars fought between 1775 and 1818 which led to the consolidation of the namesake kingdom under the control of the British East India company.

The pose of this work's central figure is derived from a fresco depicting a son of Poseidon standing on a stump by some cliffs, Annibale Caracci's Polyphemus. That central figure stands with his right foot planted firmly in front of him, and seems to bite his lip. Both the sculptor's biographer Baldinucci and the sculptor's son Domenico claim that they were the models for this work, which was created for Cardinal Scipione Borghese and still lies in the Galleria Borghese. This work departs from textual tradition by showing a harp at the title figure's feet, and during its composition, Maffeo Barberini, who later patronized this work's creator after becoming Pope Urban VIII, would hold a mirror up for this work's artist so he could model it after himself. For 10 points, name this work in which the central figure's muscles are tensing as he prepares to attack a giant opponent, a work of Gianlorenzo Bernini.

The fourteenth Fargard of the Vendidad describes an atonement process after killing one of these sacred animals which involves killing ten-thousand tortoises, land-frogs and corn-carrying ants. In Scottish folklore, there exist kings of these animals that can only be killed by attacking them below their chin and are accompanied by seven black versions of this animal. The inability of this animal to deliver a message at the request of a creator god results in the imperfections of humanity in an Ainu myth. In order to pursue Gwion who had become a salmon, the sorceress, Ceridwen took the form of one of these creatures. The skin of one of these animals was filled and covered with gold at request of Hreidmar. For 10 points, identify this playful river mammal whose name sounds similar to a Norse dwarf slain by Loki while in the form of this animal.

During one festival, these peoples would barefootedly throw beans over their shoulders in order to exorcise spirits. Another ritual that these people partook saw two priests take strips of goat meat and touch the bodies of anyone they encountered. The death rituals performed by these peoples included the cutting off of a finger, if the body were to be cremated, and the burial of that finger so that the dead did not become a mischievous spirits. Such spirits were expelled yearly at one of their festivals, and the Arval priests were members of these peoples. The casting of mannequins made of rushes into a river was the culmination of this people's feast of the Argei. The work Attic Nights describes much of their religion, and every year, they would sacrifice a pig, ram and bull to appease their god of war, while during one of their most festive occasions, each family chose a "Misrule Lord" to lead their activities, as slaves were manumitted during it.

A recent series by this artist was based on the poetry of Velimir Chlebnikov, and he painted a dark forest pervaded by a blue mist, above which is a disembodied staircase leading to an attic door in his Resurrexit. His works such as The Sixth Trumpet and Ashflower appeared alongside Book on Wings in the Heaven and Earth exhibit, and along with Baselitz, Immendorf, and Penck, this student of Joseph Beuys was one of the major neoexpressionists promoted by Michael Werner at the 1980 Venice Bienniale. He used metal shelves and burned books on canvas to create works in his Kabbalah-inspired “Merkabah” exhibit, though he is also known for frequent references to Germanic and Nordic myth as well as the Nazis, as in Zim Zum. This creator of the Sulamith series frequently combines shellac and various emulsions on canvas, while he used straw to represent the hair of a figure inspired by a Paul Celan poem.

answer: {Hermeneutics}

One theorist's two factors approach to this field of study has been understood as a necessity of fundamental "pre-knowledge" and "the necessary belong of object." Boeckh put forth a grammatical form of this discipline, which was rejected by another thinker offering his own theories of "effective history." Freidrich Schleiermacher is held to be the one to have first applied this discipline to literature from his own application of it to theology when it is necessary to go beyond the "ordinary degree of understanding." His contribution to this field was extended by Wilhelm Dilthey. This field of study is discussed at length in a work which puts forth a "horizon bridging" view of action. Its namesake circle has been discussed by Martin Heidegger, who taught the author of that aforementioned work. For 10 points, name this discipline written at length by Hans Georg Gadamer in his Truth and Method, which can be understood as the interpretation of texts.

answer: {galaxy rotation curve}

Persic, Salucci and Stel constructed a “universal” one of these after determining that their profile and amplitude both had a strong dependence on luminosity, while Blumenthal et al used the concept of adiabatic compression to describe the unusually smooth transition between the disk and halo components of these constructs. Generally these are constructed by measuring the Doppler velocities of the 21-cm line along different lines of sight. Kepler's laws predict that the quantities related by these constructs should demonstrate an inverse square relationship, but observations by Vera Rubin have shown that the relationship is roughly linear and then flattens out completely, a problem that can be corrected by considering the existence of dark matter in the halo. For 10 points, name this plot of a galaxy's orbital velocity as a function of distance from the galaxy's center.

Nozick's Philosophical Explanations contains a section about “Essence as” this concept, which proposes a thought experiment in which there is a princess, a frog, a rock, and a lily pad, which is not Woody Allen. Dennett proposed understanding this concept as a “center of narrative gravity.” Ryle propounded the “Systematic Elusiveness” of this concept, which does not even catch the “flying coat-tails” of its intended meaning. Hume claimed that the common understanding of this concept does not change in a five-year period in formulating his “bundle” theory of it. Knowledge of this concept can be explained by the “Unmediated Observation,” “Transparency,” and “Commitment” models. In Human Nature and the Social Order, C.H. Cooley proposed that this concept was based on mental states called “looking glasses.” For 10 points, name this concept, which Descartes claims can think, and therefore is.

Towards the end it launches a defense of the former Secretary of War Samuel Dexter, who argued the New England cause, which this speech juxtaposes with the legal school of his opponent, which would advocate raising the banner of the Nullifying Act. It was delivered shortly after speeches by both Benton and the speaker's primary opponent on the subject of Samuel Foot's resolution to appraise and sell public land, and this speech famously ends “Liberty and Union, now and for ever, one and inseparable!” For 10 points, name this 1830 speech, Daniel Webster's rejoinder to a senator from South Carolina.

Overexpression of one isoform of this enzyme plays a role in compensating for the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Histidine and aspartate side chains are chiefly used to complex the substrate of this enzyme, while two arginine residues are key to the functioning of its active site. Activity of this enzyme is reduced, particularly in erythrocytes, in patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy, Korsakoff's syndrome, or beriberi because its cofactor contains thiamine. This enzyme with cofactor TPP catalyzes the formation of glucose-6-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P in a cytosolic pathway that forms NADPH and its namesake five-carbon sugars. For 10 points, name this enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to D-ribose-5P and D-xylulose-5-P in the Calvin cycle or the reverse reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway.

One poem about this man claims that his “neighbour-princes” bow to him like “Joseph's sheaves.” A sonnet to this man implores him to “Help us to save free Conscience from the paw / Of hireling wolves whose gospel is their maw.” This man is likened to “three-fork'd lightning” and is compared to a falcon that perches on a bough after the kill in a poem that asserts “'Tis time to leave the books in dust” and don the corslet in the hall. That poem about this man claims that he “could not cease / In the inglorious art of peace” and that he “cast the Kingdoms old / Into another mould.” Edmund Waller dedicated “A Pangyric” to this man.
