answer: {eques} or {equites} [accept {knights} before mention]

A 1970 article by T.P. Wiseman addressed the formal definition of this group, which Nicolet argued was limited to the "eighteen centuries." The orator Publius Sulpicius Rufus was said to have been supported by a force of 100 members of this group, which clashed with his political opponents in the Roman Forum, and the popular definition of this group included anyone with a qualification of 400,000 sesterces. Domitian's rule was notable for his reliance on members of this group for his administration and reforms instituted under Hadrian allowed them to have a purely civilian career in the civil service. Considered a lower form of aristocracy than senators, unlike senators members of this class could embark on careers in commerce, in which capacity they came to form the majority of the publicani. Recognized as a military class by Augustus, this group, together with the optimates and populares formed the third major political group of the Republic. Taking its name from the fact that they were originally entitled to public support for the upkeep of a horse, for ten points, identify this "knight" class of the Roman Republic and Empire.

answer: The {Family} of {Pascual Duarte} or La {Familia} de {Pascual Duarte}

An owl in a cypress tree is a recurring symbol of death in this novel, and in one scene, the protagonist cannot bring himself to leave his favorite stone, and shoots his dog. That character later tries to kill a mare which flung his wife, thus aborting her pregnancy, and another character gets his ears bitten off by a hog. The preface to this novel includes an excerpt of a will demanding the burning of the manuscript, which was found at Don Raimundo's pharmacy, while this work closes with a letter from a prison guard to the publisher. The retarded Mario drowns in a vat of oil, and the title character runs away to the port of La Corduña for two years after the death of his son. His wife Lola dies shortly after his return, which leads him to kill the pimp El Estirao, or "Stretch." For 10 points, identify this novel in which the title Spaniard writes his memoirs in prison while awaiting his execution, a work of Camilio José Cela.

answer: {piano concertos} of {Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky}

A slightly cut edition of the second of these compositions was prepared by Alexander Siloti, and the first of these contains one movement based on the cabaret song "Il faut s'amuser, danser et rire," while another movement contains an allegro section inspired by a blind beggars' song. The third and last of these was constructed of unused material from the composer's unfinished "Symphony in E-Flat." The composer received a bitter lashing from Anton Rubenstein after playing him the first of these works, which was premiered in Boston under B.J. Lang with Hans von Bulow as the soloist. That work opens with a four-note motif sounded by all four horns punctuated by orchestral chords, which starts in the home key of B-flat minor but quickly modulates to D-flat major. For 10 points, identify these works for a keyboard instrument and orchestra by the composer of the Pathetique Symphony.

answer: {scheduling} [accept word forms]

One method of performing this task is prone to catastrophic failure if a context switch occurs while this task is being performed. A system for performing this task based on a lottery was developed by Waldspurger and Weihl. After this task is performed, control is transferred to a dispatcher, which performs a context switch. If this task is performed after a switch to a ready state, it is referred to as preemptive, while if it is performed after a switch to a waiting or inactive state, it is called cooperative. An optimal algorithm for performing this task which minimizes the average waiting time is the shortest-job-first algorithm, which is itself a special case of a priority algorithm for doing this. Simple algorithms for performing this task include the first-come-first-served algorithm, as well as an algorithm that distributes resources equally to all processes, the round-robin algorithm. The failure to carry out this task properly results in starvation. For ten points, identify this common task of an operating system, which involves allocating CPU time to running processes.

Nek2A phosphorylation of C-Nap 1 results in the eventual disjunction of these structures, and several important checkpoint kinases associate with these structures. These structures possess cylindrical objects with 9 triplet blades that form basal bodies of flagella in motile cells. Much like DNA, the constituent bodies of these structures replicate semi-conservatively. Amplification of these structures often leads to aneuploidy and is associated with many cancers, and they possess gamma-TuRC complexes at which microtubules are nucleated. They are associated with the nuclear membrane, and they move toward polar ends prior to the onset of mitosis. For 10 points, identify this structure, which is composed of two centrioles from which spindle fibers emanate.

answer: William Dean {Howells}

This critic notes that while it was a reasonable development that romanticism "lurked at the heart of realism," the lamentable rise of psychologism is apparent in romanticism, in A Psychological Counter-Current in Recent Fiction. He warned against romantic exaggeration and offered that writers should concern themselves with "the more smiling aspects of life," in such works as My Literary Passions and Criticism and Fiction. Much of this author's most influential criticism was serialized in a monthly column for Harper's Magazine from 1886 to 1892 called the "Editor's Study." In one work of criticism this novelist suggested that American novelists should stick to material that would not offend the innocence of a young girl. For 10 points, name this 19th and early 20th century American literary critic and novelist author of "The Prudishness of the Anglo-Saxon Novel."

answer: {Herbert Simon}

In a 1971 article "Designing Organizations for an Information-Rich World," this social scientists argues that the proliferation of information produces scarcity in whatever it requires to consume that information, thus introducing the notion of the "attention economy." He along with Allen Newell designed a program that would eventually prove 38 of 52 axioms located in Chapter 2 of Principia Mathematica called the "Logic Theorist." In one work he argues that "authority" is the chief mode of influence that distinguishes individual participation in organizations. His significant association with the Cowles Commission was integral in his mathematical development of Decision-making in organizations laid out in such works as Public Administration. For 10 points, name this Nobel laureate and author of Administrative Behavior who developed the concepts of satisficing and "bounded rationality."

The author of this work received vital assistance in its production from Tench Coxe, who had drafted an essay similar to this work several years earlier, and during its writing, its author made a great show of collecting and displaying samples of things such as wool and carpet. Much of this work is dedicated to refuting the theories of the Physiocrats, and this work approvingly cites British cotton mills as helping make women and children "more useful." Arguing for a lowering of tariffs, this work also claims that "the public purse must supply the deficiency of private resources," and advocates "extraordinary aid and protection of government," for infant industries. Citing the "extreme embarassment during the late war," this work's author cited the Constitution's "general welfare" clause to show how government policy could make the United States self-sufficient in arms production. Presented by the Secretary of the Treasury on December 5, 1791, for ten points, identify this document compiled on such thrilling topics as iron, glass, and gunpowder by Alexander Hamilton.

In one of this man's poems, he describes how "morning rain dampens the light dust," while another begins by telling of a fisherman who "loved the hills in spring." This poet of "The Cornel Grove" and "Birds Calling in the Ravine," was the subject of a collaboration between Eliot Weinberger and Octavio Paz, who created "19 Ways of Looking at" this man. In a lamentation for a friend, this man asked "How long can one man's lifetime last?" while another of his poems describes of how "at festivals I'm homesick through and through," recalling the poet's brothers in Shangdong. This man's "Farewell of the Friend" was used as the text for the finale of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde, and his best-known work is a short poem that describes "reflected light [shining] on the blue-green moss," in the title location. Included with Du Fu and Li Bai in Vikram Seth's Three Chinese Poets, for 10 points, name this T'ang Dynasty poet who wrote "Deer Park."

After being reinstated in his hometown, this figure convened a synod whose decisions are contained in Tomus ad Antiochenos. That synod dealt leniently with bishops who had signed the Homoean formula under duress, and this figure's articulation of the Origenistic formula helped to reconcile Homoiousians. The Letters to Epicetus, Adelphus and Maximus the Philosopher set forth this figure's orthodox doctrine on the divinity and procession of the Holy Spirit. One work by this figure, the first of its kind, provided "an ideal pattern of ascetic life," and in another work this theologian outlines God's dilemma in trying to reverse the corruption of humanity since the Fall in De Incarnatione Verbi Dei.  Dutch theologian G.J Voss first called into question a statement attributed to this figure sometimes titled by its first two words in Latin, the Quicumque vult. For 10 points, name this theologian and Church Father, author of the Life of St. Anthony with a namesake creed and a noted hater of Arius.

One major criticism of this work argued that its author takes pleasure in the impossibility of change and called the author's work which followed this one "unconscionably bad... as a work on the law of free speech." This work claims romanticism on Foucault's part when he quips that Herculine Barbin was able to live some part of her life in the "happy limbo of non-identity."  Levi-Strauss' description of the taboo incest as a "pervasive cultural fantasy," Freud's psychoanalytic explanation of mourning and melancholia, and Riviere's claim of "womanliness as a masquerade," construct this work's notion of the "Heterosexual Matrix." It begins by analyzing the incomplete notion of female subjectivity in the work of Irigaray and Beauvoir, and its author was the target of Martha Nussbaum's essay "The Professor of Parody." Advising that parodic performance like dressing in drag can bring about the title phenomenon and developing the concept of performativity, for 10 points, name this fundamental work of post-structural feminist theory by Judith Butler.

answer: {Frost}-{Ebsworth} diagrams [It {looks} like they're not named for a dude; {apparently} the {Frost stands} for FRee energy and Oxidation {STate}]

One ambiguity that arises when employing these constructs in basic solution is due to an often-tacit standard introduced by Phillips and Williams that sets the proton-hydrogen gas slope to zero. Copper is the only first-row transition metal with a positive slope on one of these representations. When species in these representations lie on convex curves, they tend to undergo disproportionation. One species will oxidize another if the first is to the upper-left of the second on these diagrams, and those at the bottom of curves on these diagrams are thermodynamically stable. The y-values on these constructs can be obtained by multiplying the number of electrons transferred in a half cell reaction times the reduction potential of that cell. These representations are occasionally named for Ebsworth and points on these diagrams can be obtained using information from Latimer diagrams. For 10 points, identify these representations in which the relative free energy of a species is plotted against various oxidation states for that species.

answer: {boundary layers}

One definition of these regions was proposed by Nernst and is related to the size of a stagnant film which has the same diffusion resistance. Mathematically, these regions arise in situations where the dynamics are described by a differential equation whose highest order derivative is multiplied by a small parameter. A phenomenon in which the quantity "d v-sub-x by dy" evaluated at y equals zero becomes negative for some geometries is known as these regions' namesake separation, and a fundamental assumption in deriving these regions is known as the no-slip condition. The size of these regions in two dimensions is inversely proportional to the square root of the Reynolds number, and the velocity profile within these regions is given by partial differential equations named after Prandtl, who proposed the existence of these regions. For ten points, identify these regions in a fluid flow past a solid body, in which viscous effects are dominant.

The prehistory of this polity consists of the traditions of the Newar people, and its first ruling dynasty was the Kirati dynasty. In the 4th century C.E., the Licchavi dynasty founded a kingdom in the region that would become this present-day nation, and this polity's first legal code was introduced by Jaya Sthiti, a ruler of the Malla dynasty. Jaya Sthiti's successor, Yaksa Malla, divided this polity into three regions, which included Patan and Bhaktpur. As a consequence of two weak kings, the leadership of this polity was assumed by the Thapa family, while during the 1860s, the Rana family managed to preserve this nation's independence. This nation was unified in 1742 by Prithvi Narayan Shah, who conquered three Malla kingdoms and established this nation's capital. For ten points, identify this nation which in the 19th century allowed the British to recruit its famous Gurkha soldiers.
