answer: prior probability distribution

A method devised by Jaynes selects these functions based on the principle of maximum entropy. Three major classes of these functions are the density ratio class, the neighborhood class, and the conjugate class. When this function is chosen to be proportional to the square root of the determinant of the Fischer information matrix, it is known as a Jeffreys one of these. If this function is picked on the basis of representing no useful information, it is called objective and is usually improper, while subjective ones represent some independent knowledge of the probability distribution. Frequently criticized by frequentists, for ten points, identify this quantity which, when multiplied by the likelihood function gives the posterior probability, according to Bayes' theorem.

answer: {Great} Railroad {Strike} of 1877

Many of the participants in this event were held in contempt by Thomas Drummond of the Seventh Circuit, who had also used the cases arising from this event to pioneer injunctions backed by the power of the US Army. Robert Brinton led a National Guard brigade during this event after Alfred Pearson argued that his Sixth Regiment would not fire on "fellow townsmen." During this event, the initial demands were presented to Alexander Cassatt, who refused to send them on to Tom Scott. After opening a volley that killed 17 people during this event, a group of Philadelphia militia retreated to the Allegheny Arsenal, following which rioters destroyed 1200 cars, 104 engines, and the Union Depot building. Beginning in Martinsburg, West Virginia, this event spread to Pittsburgh as a reaction to the introduction of "doubleheaders," and ended when, following the breakdown of negotiations at Fort Wayne, Rutherford Hayes ordered federal troops into Philadelphia. Lasting for 45 days throughout much of the mid-Atlantic region, for ten points, identify this event launched against the Pennsylvania Railroad by the Trainmen's Union in 1877, the largest of its kind in the 19th century.

answer: {Guillaume} de {Machaut}

His expressive use of changes in modality in works like Se mesdisans and Loyaute weil tous jours likely inspired the distinction between Musique artificielle and the Musique naturelle made by his student Eustache Deschamps. Amongst his works for religious occasions is his Bone pastor, qui pastores, which is his earliest dated work. Syllabic treatment of the text distinguishes his polyphonic rondeau Puis qu'en oubli while Douce dame jolie is likely the most famous amongst his virelais. Various musical inserts are strewn through his Le Voir Dit, and it was likely via the influence of works by Johannes de Muris and Philippe de Vitry that this man came to embody ars nova style. Those techniques were applied in a six movement work that ends with the isorhythmic movement Ite Missa, Est and is believed to be written for Reims Cathedral. That work is the first setting of Ordinary Mass associated with a single composer. For 10 points, name this 14th century poet-composer, known for the Notre Dame Mass.

answer: {Zuni}

According to this people, the god Kiaklo, who imparts all myths to this people, dug his own eyes out after he tried to seduce his sister Siwiluhsitsa, though he regained sight from the light of the fire god Shulawitsi. This people shares Paiteyuma, the clown companion of the sun, with the neighboring Keresan peoples, and one of their myths blames the incest among members of the Corn Clan for a great flood. Another tale of this people holds that death remains in the world because a youth could not stop himself from touching his wife, after she was brought from the Lake of the Dead for him by the owl people, and the existence of winter is attributed to Coyote's curiosity drove him to open the box containing the sun and the moon allowing them to fly away. In one creation myth attributed to this people, all living creatures were trapped in the womb of the Earth Mother, until she, taking the form of a woman, visited her own surface and was assured of nature's ability to sustain them. That myth was dubiously recorded by Frank Cushing, who wrote several works on this people after living with them for five years, and like other tribes of their region, they are known for their kachina cult. For 10 points, name this Puebloan people of New Mexico, whose mythology is the title subject of a work by Ruth Benedict.

answer: {conversos} [accept {Marranos} before mention]

Pope Nicholas V issued the bull Humani generis inimicus in an attempt to protect this group, whose origins may lie with a 616 edict issued by Sisebut. Another defense of this group was offered in a Treatise Against Midianites and Ishmaelites, while at the Council of Basel this group was defended against Marquillos by the Bishop of Burgos in a tract entitled Defence of Christian Unity. This group was protected from vilification by the word tornadizo as a consequence of the Royal Jurisdiction, which was strengthened ten years later by the Partidas issued by Alfonso X. Following the passage of the Sentancio-Estatuta, which sought to prevent members of this group from holding public office, this group was the target of riots in Toledo in 1449 instigated by Pedro Sarmiento. The doctrine of limpieza de sangre, or "purity of blood," was invoked to root out descendants of these people, who were often the targets of the Inquisition. Also known as "New Christians," and sometimes known as "Marranos," for ten points, identify this religious minority of Spain consisting mostly of former Jews.

answer: {Hammett relation} [or {Hammett} equation]

A refinement of this equation develops a better fit for the effects of resonance stabilization on positively charged transition states, and another finds separate polarity and steric factors. In drug design, one parameter from this equation or a generalization of it is plotted against hydrophobicity, the Craig plot. Unlike those developments by Taft and by Yukawa and Tsuno, another modification of this equation expresses the sigma constant as a linear combination of field and resonance effects and was proposed by Swain and Lupton.  This equation is useless for long aliphatic chains because of weak correlation between equilibrium position and transition state structure, and large steric considerations make it inapplicable for ortho isomers. For 10 points, name this equation, which relates the log of either the equilibrium constant or the reaction rate to the product of separated reaction and substituent constants and which is principally applied to para- or meta- substituted derivatives of benzoic acid.

answer: The {Whitsun Weddings}

In one poem in this collection, an “American voice demands” “Now dear child/ What's wrong” before launching into a prayer that leaves them “twitching and loud”, and that poem, “Faith Healing”, is followed by another American voice, which “falls as they say love should”, “For Sidney Bechet”. Another poem in this collection concludes with the narrator asking one of the title characters to give him his arm, a reference to The Wind and the Willows and that poem, “Toads Revisited”, refers back to a poem in an earlier collection. Another poem in this collection features an earl and countess whom “time has transfixed… into/ Untruth” and who “Rigidly…/ Persisted” in “their supine stationary voyage”. In addition to “An Arundel Tomb”, this collection, published 11 years after its author's The Less Deceived, features a poem in which the narrator watches fathers who “had never known/ Success so huge and wholly farcical” and girls unreally marked off by “lemons, mauves, and olive-ochres”, all of whom gather aboard the train that the narrator if riding following the namesake holiday. For 10 points, name this collection by Philip Larkin about matrimonial ceremonials on a certain holiday.

answer: {integrable} systems [prompt on "{Hamiltonian}" {systems}]

In driven systems that are not of this type, the stable and unstable manifolds do not coincide. A distinctive feature of these systems is the presence of continuous families of periodic orbits, a consequence of the Poincare-Birkhoff theorem, and systems of this type also admit equilibrium and quasiperiodic orbits. The term describing these systems is also used to describe constraints which can be written in terms of the derivative of a coordinate constraint and the classical form of the KAM theorem concerns the stability of perturbations to Hamiltonian systems of this type. Systems of this type have a number of independent conserved quantities equal to the number of their degrees of freedom, and in these systems, the mutual Poisson brackets of the conserved quantities all vanish. A canonical example of such a system is a periodically driven amplitude with small drive amplitude. For 10 points, identify these types of dynamical systems, so named because they admit direct solutions by anti-derivatives.

answer: Louis-Auguste {Blanqui}

After being strongly influenced by the doctrines of Filippo Buonarotti, this man organized the "Society of Families," and the "Society of the Seasons," with which he attempted an 1839 insurrection against his country's government. His long terms of imprisonment for revolutionary activities led him to be known as l'enferme, or "the locked-up one," and his writings include the collection Critique sociale as well as a manual on urban guerilla warfare entitled "Instruction for a Taking Up of Arms." During the Franco-Prussian war, this journalist encouraged resistance to the Germans in the periodical "Our Country in Danger," and shortly after his 1881 death, a reconciliation between Marxists and the followers of this man resulted in the formation of the Central Revolutionary Committee.This man's election as the deputy from Bordeaux in 1879 was invalidated, and the government of Adolphe Thiers refused to recognize the presidential election of this man during an 1870 revolt. For ten poins, identify this French Socialist, who was elected President of the Paris Commune.
