answer: {Romola}

One historical figure in this novel states that "veracity is a plant of paradise, and the seeds have never flourished beyond the walls" in response to another character's claim that his city's leader is a "false prophet." The title character's brother, a monk, warns her that marriage would bring her unhappiness before dying, and later her husband returns from Rome to settle a peace with an invading army. When that man learns that his father, whom he had neglected to rescue earlier, is a prisoner in his city, he sells Bardo de' Bardi's library and leaves. Tessa, a neighbor, has an affair with the title character's husband, whose father Baldassare repeatedly attempts to kill him, finally succeeding on the banks of the Arno. Earlier, the title character had witnessed the Bonfire of the Vanities, and returns to Savonarola's teachings even though he had refused to assist her in dealing with the treacherous Tito Melema. The political upheaval of Florence in the late 15th century is the background of, for 10 points, what historical novel by the author of The Lifted Veil and Scenes of Clerical Life, George Eliot?

The title character of this work sings ‘Der Mensch ist ein Abgrund.' The 12 note theme of a passacaglia is played in the cellos as one character is accused of coughing, and the scene then proceeds with 21 variations on that theme, culminating in the singing of ‘eine schöne fixe Idee.' An eighth note moto perpetuum dominates the last scene, while a motif consisting of a minor chord with a major seventh accompanies the singing of  'Wir arme Leut.' Two characters in this work are related by a B-F tritone, and a madman observes that it reeks of blood following a drunken sermon and the hunter's chorus. The title character is antagonized by the Captain and the Doctor, provoking him into killing Marie for her adultery with the Drum Major. For 10 points, name this opera based on a Buchner play, a work of Alban Berg.

While discussing the death penalty, one character in this novel states that the two scenes he remembers best from literature are the "Off with their heads!" scene from Alice in Wonderland and a Hans Christian Andersen tale about a prince who hides behind a tree and kills passing travelers. At the beginning of the novel, the protagonist browses through a wide variety of items including whale turds, a "bear's ass-scratcher," and a stuffed sewer rat, before his attention is caught by the eupcaccia, or clockbug. His entry into town was motivated by a need to raise a crew of 385 people for a structure with a toilet that can flush any material out to sea. However, he is only able to find three companions, and later in the novel the Wild Boar Stew Gang fights his father Inototsu and the rest of the Broom Brigade. The title structure is loaded with electronics, weapons, and food, and is inhabited by an insect collector, his shill, and the shill's girlfriend, in addition to the protagonist. For 10 points, name this novel about Pig, also called Mole, who builds a massive shelter in an underground quarry in anticipation of nuclear fallout, written by Kobo Abe.

answer: {Workhouses}

The first chapter of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present, entitled “Midas,” is dedicated to the denunciation of these institutions, which he analogized to the Bastille. A notable scandal occurred during the investigation of one of these institutions run by Colin McDougal, and many of these institutions were created under the auspices of a commission headed by Edwin Chadwick. The administration of these entities by parishes was codified in the 1782 Gilbert Act, which resulted in the formation of so-called Gilbert Unions, while the Sturgis-Bourne act instructed these institutions to distinguish between “deserving” and “undeserving” individuals. Prior to the passage of an act that standardized the use of these institutions, they were supplemented by subsidies in the Speenhamland system. The commission in charge of administering these entities was abolished in 1847 following investigations into scandalous treatment of the inhabitants of one of these institutions located in Andover. Originally maintained by the London Corporation for the Poor, these institutions proliferated, with harsher living conditions, following the passage of the 1834 Poor Laws. For 10 points, name these locations in Britain where poor people were supported in exchange for their labor.

answer: {azide}

Two equivalents of this functional group react in a cascade of two consecutive rearrangements first reported by Banert. A diphenylphosphoryl reagent of this functionality is useful for forming urethanes when the Schmidt reaction fails. An acyl example of this functional group participates in a reaction that is analogous to the Wolff rearrangement; an isocyanate results from that reaction, named for Curtius. This functional group can react with an alkyne in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to form a 1,2,3-triazole; that reaction is a type of Huisgen cyclization important to click chemistry. Students will generally first encounter blast shields and double-gloving in working with this functional group's sodium salt, which is used in air bags because it releases nitrogen gas when heated. For 10 points, name this functional group, which consists of three consecutive nitrogen atoms connected by double bonds.

answer: {Billy Bathgate}

The main character of this work is first noticed by his benefactor as he stands juggling near a warehouse. The title character of this novel takes the lawyer Dixie Davis as a model for how to dress, and is impressed when an accountant in this novel performs some tricks with numbers. In order to secure a favorable trial for himself, a major character in this novel stays at the Onondaga Hotel and even converts to Catholicism with the help of Father Montaine, but that plan is compromised when that character kills Julie Martin over a $50,000 debt. The title character of this novel, whose name is taken from the Bronx street on which he grew up, has an affair with Drew Preston, the mistress of the gangster for whom he works, and who is shot along with his associates Rosenkrantz and Abbadabba Berman at the end of this novel. Opening with the execution of the defector Bo Weinberg, for ten points, identify this novel whose title character is a member of Dutch Schultz's gang, written by E.L. Doctorow.

answer: The Concept of {Law}

One part of this work list several "pathologies," such as a revolution or an enemy occupation, and denies that any paradox exists by citing the examples of Tsarist vs. Soviet Russia. This work repeatedly cites the 19th century thinker John Austin, whose system this work judges inadequate. In another section, such concepts as human vulnerability, limited resources, and limited altruism are listed as among the "minimal content" of a one form of the title concept. That chapter also argues for a "wider" concept of the title discipline which would allow one to distinguish invalidity from immorality. This work's most famous argument is that the title institution consists of primary and secondary rules, which govern conduct and the institution's modification respectively, and advances the idea of the "rule of recognition," which determines which edicts are recognized as authoritative. For ten points, identify this work which became the cornerstone of modern legal positivism, the most famous of H.L.A. Hart.

answer: {molecular beam} epitaxy or {MBE}

The genesis of this technique lies in the work of Joyce and Bradley with monosilane. One hazard in employing this process with gallium arsenide or aluminum gallium arsenide is the formation of a pit with or without a spike, a situation known as an oval defect. In this process, Knudsen effusion cells are used to evaporate or sublime a metal, and during this process growth is usually monitored via reflection high energy electron diffraction, or RHEED. This process has the advantage over chemical vapor deposition in that it allows for the use of a lower temperature, and unlike liquid-phase epitaxy it easily allows for the manufacturing of thin films, since its deposition rate is about one monolayer per second. For ten points, identify this technique in which evaporated metals in an ultra-high vacuum environment are directed, together with dopants, onto a substrate.

During an interview with Edgar Snow in this city, the leader of a political party there pulled down his pants to check for lice. The rebellion that overthrew the Ming Dynasty was begun in this city. In this city, “On Practice” and “On Contradiction” were written and the practice of “self criticism” was begun. This city that was the center of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was the site of the US government's attempts to explore an alliance with the Communists, the Dixie Mission. In this city, intellectuals were attacked and killed as the May Fourth Movement was phased out. That was this city's namesake Rectification Movement. Celebrated as the beginning place of the Chinese Revolution, this is, for 10 points, what city in Shaanxi province, the end point of the Long March?

One member of this family was made an imperial vicar by King Adolf of Nassau, while another member of this family married his daughter to Louis, the duc d'Orleans, and was known as the “Count of Valor.” That member of this family had previously engaged in a protracted struggle with his brother Bernabo. This family's founder defeated a rival family at the Battle of Desio, and their expansionist policies resulted in John XXII preaching a crusade against them. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia made one member of this family a hereditary duke in 1395, making that man, Gian Galeazzo, the first Italian ruler to receive such an honor. Founded by Archbishop Otto, this family's power was consolidated by Matteo I, who expelled the Della Torre family from the city which was the base of this family's power. The last member of this family to hold power was Filippo Maria, whose death in 1447 was followed by three years of republican rule and then the rule of Francesco Sforza. For ten points, identify this Italian family which from 1277 until 1447 ruled Milan.

answer: {titin} [or {connectin}]

This protein's exon Novex-3 has been found to encode an alternative C-terminal domain, and this protein's many PEVK exons may give it its most important physical characteristic. Familial dilated cardiomyopathy has been found to result from an insertion mutation or a missense mutation in the gene coding for this protein, and abnormal isoform ratios of it have been implicated in ventricular stiffening in patients with ischemic heart disease. Upregulation of seven of its PEVK exons contributes to inflexibility in the lung tissue of patients with COPD. This protein has its C-terminus in the A-band, and it interacts near the I-band with obscurin and the actin-binding protein nebulin. For 10 points, name this enormous protein that connects the M line and Z line of a sarcomere and gives muscles their passive elasticity.

answer: {von Neumann} architecture [or {stored}-{program computer}]

John Backus coined the term for one of the problems with this design and discussed its intellectual equivalent that encourages “word-at-a-time thinking,” and that problem cam be counteracted with a cache in NUMA. One of the innovations of this design was retrieval of data from RAM to be translated into machine code and then processed in the faster register; that process is known as the fetch-decode-execute cycle. One alteration to this scheme is the combination of the arithmetic-logic and control units into the CPU. The primary drawback of this design scheme stems from the sequential, rather than parallel, processing, which leads to limited speed of throughput relative to the size of the memory and forces the CPU to spend too much time in the wait state. For 10 points, name this design model with an eponymous bottleneck that uses a single structure as memory for data and instructions and is often contrasted with a Harvard architecture.

answer: {follicle}-{stimulating} hormone [or {FSH}]

This hormone has been found to stimulate the release of TNF and promote osteoclast and osteoblast formation, and it is secreted in lower levels in patients with Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Binding to one form of its receptors can imitate growth signals to trigger ovarian cancer cell proliferation. Decreased production of inhibin or increased production of activin can increase levels of this hormone, whose release is stimulated by a hormone that isn't produced in patients with Kalmann syndrome. Binding its receptors in Sertoli cells increases the production of androgen-binding protein, and this hormone, whose release is stimulated by the hypothalamic hormone GnRH, serves as a survival factor for what will become the dominant ovum in an ovary. For 10 points, name this gonadotropin that, like luteinizing hormone, is created in the anterior pituitary gland and that plays an important role in the maturation of ova and sperm.
