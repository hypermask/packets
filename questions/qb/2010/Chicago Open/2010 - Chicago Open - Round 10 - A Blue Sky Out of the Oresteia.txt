answer: Philosophy and the {Mirror} of {Nature}

In one section of this work, the author quotes extensively from Charles Taylor's “Interpretation and the Science of Man” in response to Kuhn's Essential Tension. In another section of this work, Quine's “idea idea” is contrasted with Sellars Myth of the Given, with the latter explained to be compatible with general moral sentiments; that section is “Privileged Representations.” In one famous thought experiment from this work, a race of creatures describes being burned on a stove by saying “he'll stimulate his C-fibers!” and “I had G-412 together with F11,” because those creatures explicitly number their own mental states. Those people are introduced in a chapter of this book entitled“Persons Without Minds” and are the Antipodeans. The author of this work argues that science is one project among many and advances his argument that rejects the correspondence theory of truth is a section titled “Philosophy without” the titular objects. With the first section “Our Glassy Essence,” FTP, identify this work of Richard Rorty.

It begins with references to “that old faggot Mrs. Riordan” and muses on the death of Lt. Gardner in the Boer War and the connection between a painting of a nymph and metempsychosis. It relates how Miss Stack brought “the worst” flowers at “the bottom of the barrel,” providing a contrast for the later recollections of the roses in the hair of the Andalusian girls, a reference to its speaker's youth in Gibraltar as the daughter of Major Tweedy and Lunita Laredo. It begins and ends with a word it's author called “acquiescence and end of all resistance,” and closes by describing how its speaker used the feel of her breasts and the smell of her perfume to get a lover's heart “going like mad.” Ending with “yes I said yes I will say Yes,” this passage relates its speaker's dissatisfaction with her husband's sex drive and her affair with Blazes Boylan, and constitutes the final section of a work which casts Stephen Daedelus as Telemachus. FTP, identify this final portion of Ulysses, a stream of consciousness monologue delivered by the wife of Leopold Bloom.

answer: {chemical clock reactions} (accept {chemical oscillator} before mentioned)

The Briggs-Rauscher reaction is an example of this class of reaction that combines non-radical and radical steps, as does the similar Bray-Liebhafsky reaction.  One of the namesakes of one of these was attempting to create an abiotic analog of the citric acid cycle. That reaction involves the oxidation and reduction of cerium ions, and is named for Belousov and Zhabotinsky. The Old Nassau reaction is a variant of Landolt's reaction, with both being driven by the interconversion among iodine, iodide, and iodate, using starch indicator to produce a dark blue or black solution.  Popular in laboratory demonstrations due to the cyclic generation of different colored product solutions, for 10 points, name this type of far-from-equilibrium reaction whose shifting concentrations of products and reactants can be modeled by a damped harmonic oscillator.

answer: {Jordan} curve theorem

The Mizar and HOL Light computational systems were independently used to generate a formal proof of this theorem in 2005. One method of this proof due to Maehara derives a contradiction with the Brouwer fixed point theorem. Another proof of this theorem relies on the use of a special case of the Siefert-van Kampen theorem to demonstrate that two inclusions induce trivial homomorphisms of the fundamental groups. The theorem of its namesake and Schönflies extends this statement to stipulate that the regions involved are both homeomorphic to the circle, but Alexander's horned sphere is a counterexample to that theorem that prevents it from generalizing to dimensions greater than two. For 10 points, give this rather intuitive theorem named for a French mathematician that establishes that every non-self-intersecting closed curve in a plane divides the plane into interior and exterior regions.

answer: {Penn Central Transportation} Company

A book about the history of this institution by Joseph Daughen and Peter Binzen focuses on the squabbling between camps led by Stuart Saunders, David Bevan, and its chairman Alfred Perlman. A Marcel Breuer development proposal by this company, rejected under the Landmarks Law led to a Supreme Court case which legitimized the use of transfer of development rights as a mechanism to avoid regulatory takings, [This Company] vs. New York City. In addition to its two titular predecessors, which were famous for the Horseshoe Curve and the Water Level Route respectively, this company was forced by the ICC to take on the New York, New Haven, and Hartford, a commuter-heavy operation whose heavy losses contributed to this company's bankruptcy in 1970, a mere two years after formation. For 10 points, name this large and short-lived Northeastern railroad, whose failure led to the passage of the Staggers Act and formation of Conrail.

answer: {Mahmoud Darwish}

This man's collection Why Did You Leave the Horse Alone is considered his most autobiographical writing, a departure from book-length poems like “Another Year” and “That is Her Image and This is The Lover's Suicide.” His best-known prose poetry describes being “killed in a flash,” the comforts of cigarettes and coffee and the sounds of war planes. One poem by this man was published in translation in Ma'ariv in 1988, giving this man overnight celebrity thanks to Shefi Gaabi mistranslating expressions like “from the sea to the Jordan River.” Those works are Memory for Forgetfulness about Lebanon in 1982 and the “Those Who Pass Between Fleeting Words.” With Arabic poetry collections like Birds are Dying in Galilee and Writing in the Light of the Gun, FTP, identify this man who wrote “record!/I am an Arab” in his “Identity Card,” a Palestinian poet.

answer: The {Nigerian}-{Biafran Civil War} [or the {Biafran War}]

One commander in this conflict abruptly left to go on holiday in Britain's Lake District after getting most of men slaughtered when he tried to forge a massive river rather than wait for a bridge to be built. Following this conflict, the victorious commander implemented the “three Rs” policy and delivered the controversial “no victors, no vanquished speech.” Nefarious actions in this conflict were helmed by men known as the “Black Scorpion” and “Kaduna,” whose corpse was mutilated during a military burial, and it was preceded by a massacre and subsequent population exodus from Port Harcourt. This conflict saw the final combat service of famed Polish ace Jan Zumbach, who flew a B26 Invader that was often escorted by the MiniCOIN aircraft procured for it by Carl Gustaf von Rosen. A failed attempt to prevent its outbreak resulted in a proposed twelve-fold political division in the Aburi Accord, whose enforcement was given as the casus belli by the FMG under Jack Gowon. Bernard Kouchner's involvement in this conflict led to the founding of Doctors Without Borders, and its brutality was tolerated by Western countries due to recent oil reserve discoveries. Resulting in the downfall of a government led by Philip Effiong and President Ojukwu, FTP, name this 1967-1970 conflict that saw the suppression of a secessionist state by a West African military government then based out of Lagos.

answer: The House Of The {Seven Gables}

Minor characters in this work include an itinerant organ-grinder with a diorama and the destitute but cheerful Uncle Venner; while another character is a photographer who believes that each generation must destroy the institutions of their parents'. That character, Holgrave, hypnotizes Phoebe but refuses to take advantage of her, and wins her love at the end. The author of this work included a preface which labeled this novel a "romance" which had "more to do with the clouds overhead than with any portion of the actual soil of the County of Essex." Much of the action of this novel centers on the search for the Colonel's missing deed for a tract of land in Maine by Judge Jaffrey, who was rumored to have framed his cousin Clifford for a murder thirty years earlier. At the end of this work, Clifford and his sister Hepzibah Pyncheon leave their residence, which until the Judge's timely demise had been haunted by Matthew Maule, who originally owned the land on which this work's titular structure was built. For 10 points, name this Nathaniel Hawthorne novel about a "rusty wooden house".

He worked with Charlie Haden on Soapsuds, Soapsuds, while among this man's first songs recorded playing the violin and trumpet was “Snowflakes and Sunshine” from the album At the Golden Circle Stockholm. LPs such as Opening the Caravan of Dreams and Of Human Feelings came out of his Prime Time band, and various older songs were reworked for his most recent album, which features “Song X” and “Turnaround.” “Un Muy Bonita” appears on Change of the Century, while one album by this theorist of “harmolodics” was subtitled A Collective Improvisation and consisted of only the title track and “First Take”, while yet another begins with the track “Lonely Woman”. For 10 points, identify this saxophonist best known for albums like Free Jazz, The Shape of Jazz to Come, and the 2007 Grammy winner Sound Grammar.

This work curiously precedes its denunciations of pseudosciences with an astonishingly long exposition on “letter magic,” and it warns against the rise of organized groups out the outer boundaries of an empire's reach, since they are closer to their nomadic origins and more apt to generate new factional loyalty. The neutral tone of this work, extolled in an early section about bias and the “seven errors” made by a certain profession, is somewhat abandoned in sections criticizing Geber as a fraud and espousing the author's Ashari beliefs on jurisprudence. Variable taxation returns and a labor theory of value are discussed in its economics-centered fifth chapter, while its sixth and final book argues for the use of scientific rigor and warns against the influence of compounded sensationalism, citing pervasive accounts of physically impossible military statistics. This work espouses that the pivotal force in human development is the bond of social cohesiveness it dubs asabiyyah, and its name derives from its role as an introduction to its author's longer historical record. Translated into Greek as the Prolegomena, FTP, identify this fourteenth century work regarded as a major forerunner of historiography and sociology, written by Muslim thinker Ibn Khaldun.

answer: {Degenerate} Art or {Entartete Kunst}

This event's organizer scattered reproductions of his work showing four nude women on a bench, The Four Elements, throughout its floor plan, which caused viewers to frequently collide with protruding genitalia in the “anti-woman” room. This event was promoted using an image of The New Man, a flattened, moai-like sculpture of a stone head by Freundlich, on the cover of its catalog. One artist's inclusion in this exhibition led him to depict its major sponsor being swallowed up by skeletons “in Hell,” and it was cluttered with various plaques like the one describing how “the Negro becomes the racial ideal” next to a work by Otto Mueller. Featuring multiple pieces by artists such as Grosz, Dix, Nolde, and Kirchner alongside The Twittering Machine by Klee, it centrally showcased works of New Objectivity, The Bridge, and Bauhaus often hung at odd angles or without frames. Organized with the aid of the Combat League and seeking to venerate nationalist romanticism, FTP, identify this 1937 art show organized by the Nazi party to illustrate examples of the namesake artistic decadence.

answer: {oxygenases} [or {oxidases} or {oxidoreductases} until “{reductase}”]

One of this class of enzyme is required for the metabolism of naphthalene in Pseudomonas bacteria. One example of these produces retinal from beta-carotene, while another cleaves heme to form biliverdin. One member of this class, H37Rv, is inhibited by the tuberculosis drugs clotronazole and econazole; most cytochrome P450 enzymes like H37Rv are members of this class. This class also includes a group of enzymes that convert arachidonic acid to an eicosanoid and are inhibited by substances such as naproxen and aspirin, which inhibits one that is necessary for the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxane. That group is the “cyclo-” type of this class of enzyme, which also has a “mono-” variety. In plants, a major enzyme acts as a member of this class, rather than as its usual carboxylase, during photorespiration; that enzyme catalyzes the first step in carbon fixation and is called RuBisCO. For 10 points, name this class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of part or all of a molecule of O2.

answer: {Occitan} or {Provençal}

The earliest known work in this language is a biography of Boethius, and the parable of the virgins was dramatized as Sponsus in tis language and Latin. One work in this language tells the story of a doomed romance between the basket-maker Vincent and the titular well-to-do maiden from La Crau. In addition to writing Calendau and the aforementioned Miréio, Frédéric Mistral was active in the Felibrige, a mid-19th century group which sought to promote this language. Traditional forms of poetry in this language include the funeral dirge planh and the debate-like tenso; the oldest surviving examples of both of these forms are attributed to Cercamon. More famous works in this tongue include the cantos of Bernard de Ventadorn, many of which were dedicated to Eleanor of Aquitane. Taking one of its names from a passage in Dante's De vulgari eloquentia referring to the various forms of "yes" in Romance languages, for 10 points, name this language of the medieval troubadours in southern France.

One participant in this event died of shame after she discovered her promised sexual favors had prompted the deaths of several hundred men, while another fell despite his rocky skin after being pinned to a river bed by his best friend. One man joined this event after a recently-severed head continued to berate him for his absence, and it was facilitated by a plague sent by a woman in retaliation for being forced to race a chariot while nine months pregnant. The origins of this event lie in a transmogrification-provoking dispute between swineherds, and it was nearly prevented entirely before a prostitution transaction was spoiled by drunken go-betweens. The central figure of this event took a three-day nap that triggered his transformation into a murderous rampaging monster and was at various points distracted by sexual tension with the Morrigan and visitations from his true father, Lugh. The impetus for this event arose from a dispute over comparative wealth that was resolved due to the presence of Finnbhennach in favor of Ailill, prompting the jealousy of Queen Maeve. Fergus mac Roich retired from the field to end the string of single combats that characterized this mythical event. FTP, identify this event that saw the forces of Connacht abduct Donn Cuailnge from Ulster despite the heroism of Cuchulainn, certainly the most famous incident of Bovine theft in Celtic myth.

answer: Battle of {Magenta}

One of the major primary sources for this battle is correspondence of Colonel Ardant du Picq who was stationed on near the village of Turbigo on the banks of a river strategically important to this battle. The first shots fired in this battle came when Count Clam helped to take a dam at the Naviglio while the ultimately losing side of this battle took its namesake point after fighting at Robecco. The turning point of this battle was the arrival of reinforcements from Novara under the Marshal Francois de Certain-Canrobert, which beat back an assault at Ponte Vecchio. With most of the struggle around the Ticino River, the surrender of Milan followed this defeat of the Austrians under Franz Gyulani by the French under Patrice MacMahon who took this battle's name as his ducal title . FTP, identify this battle of the Second War of Italian Independence occurring about 20 days before Solferino.

This book is the prophetical text read on Yom Kippur during the afternoon services. This book's namesake covers himself in sackcloth and sits in ashes, and causes a commandment to be issued that “neither man nor beast, her nor flock, taste any thing.” The prayer that ultimately saves the namesake of this book claims that “they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.” That man, the son of Amittai, is last seen pledging to be angry until the day that he dies after God sends a worm that withers the gourd that man was sitting under for shade. This book sees that man flee by way of Joppa to Tarshish to escape God's instruction to preach against Ninevah, and is eventually thrown overboard, where his best-known fate befalls him. FTP, identify this book of the Hebrew bible where the namesake prophet is eaten, then barfed up, by a whale.

Julius Conus wrote a work of this type in E minor, while A minor is the key of both a one movement work by Jean-Baptiste Accolay as well as the 22nd of the 29 works of this type composed by Giovanni Battista Viotti. Erich Wolfgang Korngold's work uses two themes from Another Dawn and Juarez for the opening Moderato Nobile movement. One composer's fifth work in this genre is in A minor and gained its nickname from a quotation of the aria “Où peut-on être mieux” from Lucile. Another work of this type had a first movement originally called Introduzione-Fantasia, but later changed to Vorspiel or “Prelude.” Besides the “Gretry” of Henri Vieuxtemps and Max Bruch's first in G minor, Mozart composed five, including “Strassburg” and “Turkish,” while other works in this genre include a piece that ends with a “Rondo a la Clochette.” For 10 points, name this type of work that includes “La Campanella” by Paganini.

answer: {Straight Outta Compton}

One song on this album concerns a figure from whom “you can get the real,” unlike gankers, who “got the fake”; that figure has “money up to here” and the narrator says of him “yeah, boy wear corduroy.” One subject of that song is the fellatio performed by someone who is “not quite a bitch, but far from a wife.” A speaker on its title track identifies himself as someone “that'll fuck yo mother/and make your sister think I love her.” Another track recalls “sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts” and laments the difficulty of picking up women with six people in one car and repeatedly wonders “what the fuck are they yellin?” This album features the tracks “Dopeman” and “Gangsta Gangsta.” Itemized complaints on its best known song include nut grabbing, “[putting] up my picture with silence,” and objections to “me and Lorenzo rolling in a benzo;” that track is framed as a series of testimonies following the query about telling “nothin' but the truth so help your black ass” and was notably never released as a single. Featuring a title track proclaiming “you are about to witness the strength of street knowledge” and a piece deriding a group that “[has] the authority to kill a minority,” it was the first studio collaboration between DJ Yella, MC Ren, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube. FTP, identify this album containing “Fuck the Police,” a founding effort of gangsta rap by NWA whose name suggests the group's origins in the titular crime-ridden Los Angeles suburb.

While serving in the legislature, this man was supposed to have developed a rivalry with Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, though correspondence discovered later shows a secret alliance between the two and Joseph Tarte. During the Fisheries Embroglio, this man led a legislative movement questioning the arrest of foreign fisherman, calling it unfriendly and unmanly. During this man's frequent absences for the purposes of attending Imperial Conferences, his post was held by Richard Cartwright, who had also served as finance minister advocating free trade in this man's government. Notable legislative achievements during this man's premiership include a Naval Service Bill and increasing reciprocity with the US, a policy hated by Conservative Leader of the Opposition Robert Borden, and he came to power following a conflict over provisions in the British North America Act which governed the administration of certain educational institutions. Charles Tupper's failure to resolve the Manitoba Schools crisis led to this man's election as the first francophone prime minister as a Liberal from Quebec.

answer: {spherical harmonics}

In the standard analysis of CMB polarization, the polarization field is decomposed into the spin-weighted variety of these mathematical objects. The method of partial-wave expansion relies on expressing the scattering amplitude as a sum of these objects. The matrix elements generated by the action of a tensor operator on one of these functions is proportional to a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient according to the Wigner-Eckhart theorem. While the Laguerre polynomials solve the radial part of the hydrogen wavefunction, these functions give the angular component of the wavefunction. In physics, these functions are encountered as the eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator and they consist of prefactors that depend on their l and m indices multiplied by the associated Legendre polynomial. For ten points, identify these mathematical functions which solve the angular part of Laplace's equation in their namesake coordinate system.
