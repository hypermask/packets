answer: The {Shipyard} or {El astillero}

A parenthetical alternate ending to this novel imagines that its main character died of pneumonia in Rosario. A minor character in this novel, Dr. Diaz Grey, appears in a previous novel by the same author entitled A Brief Life, while this work's main character reappears in a future novel entitled Body Snatcher. One character in this novel has forged stock certificates for 10,000 pesos and sold the forgeries, which leads a character named Galvez to say that he could put the owner of the title business in jail whenever he wants. This novel's main character is assisted by the technical manager Kunz, and pursues both Maria, the pregnant wife of Galvez, and Angelica Ines, the daughter of his employer Jeremias Petrus, who had forged the aforementioned certificates. Set, like many of its author's works, in the fictional town of Santa Maria, for ten points, identify this novel in which Larsen returns to Santa Maria to become general manager of the titular maritime enterprise, probably the most famous work of Juan Carlos Onetti.

answer: the {Burned Over District}

An extensive study of the history of this region was conducted by Whitney Cross, who connected the activity in this region to an overabundance of women and an increase in educational uniformity. In opposition to activities in this region, John Williamson Nevin founded the Mercersburg movement, and one famous individual active in this region was opposed at the 1827 New Lebanon Conference by Nathaniel Berman and Lyman Beecher. Berman and Beecher were in opposition to what they called the “new measures,” being employed in this region, which focused on plain speaking, direct address, and titles like “The Wages of Sin is Death.” The name of this region was popularized by Charles Grandison Finney, who sparked the activity that this region is famous for with sermons at Rome, Utica, and Rochester. Lying west of the Catskills and the site of intense evangelical preaching from 1825 until about 1850, for ten points, identify this region of western New York, whose name comes from the fact that religious revivals spread through it like fire.

answer: {Romare Bearden}

This man's Prologue to Troy, No.2 is a reworking of Lucas Cranach's Judgment of Paris, while two bluebirds on branches join the title figure in Elvira Among the Flowers. The Sea Nymph was part of an exhibition associating him with Odysseus, and his time on St. Maarten studying Chinese calligraphy influenced a homage to Andrew Marvell which depicts a bathing woman watched by an egret in a tropical landscape. That work, which is called In a Green Shade, was created a year after his first Mecklenburg Autumn series. Conjure Woman and a Zurbaran inspired painting called Baptism are part of his Prevalence of Ritual series and he created The Lamp on the 30th anniversary of Brown v. Board. He also created works like Summertime, Patchwork Quilt, and The Calabash, all examples of his collage works. For 10 points, name this artist, perhaps best known for using techniques drawn variously from Op Art, the Mexican muralists, and cubism to depict African-American life.

answer: {Joseph} de {Maistre}

This man identified his philosophy regarding the Masons in his Memoir to the Duke of Brunswick. One of his works draws on Origen's On First Principles to identify the ambivalence inherent in the expiatory virtue of “the effusion of blood,” though that work goes on to condemn the superstition surrounding its title concept. Besides Enlightenment on Sacrifice, this man defended a widely maligned institution in his Letters to a Russian Gentleman on the Spanish Inquisition. A series of debates between The Knight, The Count, and The Senator comprise one of his works, while the fourth part of another work begins by declaring every schismatical church a Protestant church. That work's second section deals with the title figure's relations with “his temporal sovereignties,” while the first section declares its subject infallible. For 10 points, name this ultramontane Savoyard who wrote the Saint Petersburg Dialogues and presented his Catholic apologetics in On the Pope.

answer: {genetic linkage} algorithms

Algorithms for analyzing this property are attributed to Elston and Stewart and to Lander and Green, though the latter is limited to small pedigrees. The LOD score refers to the ratio of the probability that data arise due to a given value of this property to the probability that they arise due to this property being absent and is maximized in an algorithm for determining this property developed by Strachan and Read. Mapping functions to define distance in terms of the complement of this property were originated by Kosambi and by Haldane. Microsatellite tracking can be used to evaluate this property, which can also be evaluated by calculating recombination frequency. A unit of distance that refers to a one in one hundred chance that this property's complement occurs is called the centimorgan. This quality most often arises due to physical proximity on a gene. For 10 points, give this term that refers to the tendency of multiple loci to violate independent assortment and to instead be inherited together.

answer: the parable of the man before the {law} or {vor dem Gesetz} [accept anything which {indicates} that it is the {story} of the {law}; accept “{parable} of the {door}-{keeper}” before it is mentioned, prompt on “In the {Cathedral}” before mention]

The reading of this section of a larger work was the basis for Jacques Derrida's 1985 book Prejudice, and its author is the subject of a chapter entitled “Canonical Patience and Indestructibility,” in Harold Bloom's The Western Canon . Walter Benjamin claimed that this part of a larger work appears at such a significant moment that it looks as though the novel in which it is contained is only the unfolding of this story. This fragment of a larger work is followed by an interpretive monologue that considers such aspects as the “impersonal questions,” and the “Tatar beard,” of one individual in this story, and the man who tells it later remarks that “the man sits down on the stool... and waits there for the rest of his life... of his own free will.” This story, which is contained in a chapter entitled “In the Cathedral,” concerns a man who seeks admission to something that he thinks “should be accessible to every man and at all times,” but is denied entrance by a door-keeper, who, upon the man's death, shuts the door. Related by a priest to Joseph K., for ten points, identify this parable about a certain human institution contained in Franz Kafka's The Trial.

answer: {Pierre Puget}

This sculptor was commissioned to create a series of paintings including a Visitation at the chapel in the Jesuit's college at Aix-en-Provence. He drew on the paintings of artists such as Giovanni Andrea Ferrari and Gioacchino Asseretto for his early terracotta work Storming of St. Peter, while other works in Genoa include decorations for the Lorellini family and two sculptures to be placed under the dome of the Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano. Besides creating those depictions of Sebastian and the Blessed Alessandro Sauli, his later works include a Perseus and Andromeda group commissioned by Louis XIV for Versailles. His most famous sculpture depicts a man twisting his torso to remove a hand that has become stuck in the stump of an oak tree, and that man is depicted with claws sinking into his thighs as lion bites into his backside. For 10 points, name this French Baroque sculptor, best known for his Milo of Crotona.

answer: {aromaticity}

This property has been been observed in a four aluminum atom cluster compound and a tritungsten nonoxide anion. This property may be quantified as the diamagnetic susceptibility exaltation, symbolized capital lambda. One molecule with this property is formed in the Elbs reaction. One family of reactions with these molecules sees them form allylic cations called Wheland intermediates. Ring currents in molecules with this property severely shield protons above and below them and deshield those in their plane. The energy owing to this property is named for Dewar, and a form of this property, exhibited by barrelene, was first demonstrated by Herges.. For 10 points, name this property of molecules that have continuous cyclic systems of sp2 hybridized atoms, which generally have 4n+2 pi electrons in those systems, an especially strong resonance stabilization..

answer: {Avalokitesvara}

This figure's name is often translated as ``the lord of what is seen,'' or ``the lord who sees.'' Extensively studied by Marie-Therese de Mallmann, this figure is sometimes represented in the form of Amoghapasa, which depicts him holding a rope, or in the form of Hayagriva, which depicts him with a horse's head. A notable protector of seafarers, this being is worshipped as Kannon in Japan, where pilgrimage circuits to him have 33 stations in recognition of his 33 manifestations, and he is one of the key protectors of Tibet, where the mantra ``Om mane padme hum'' is recited in praise of him. A discussion of this figure's many forms, the dangers he can dispel, and his name appears in the 25th chapter of the Lotus Sutra, while the Flower Garland Sutra identifies his dwelling place as Potalaka Mountain. According to the Pure Land Sutra, this being, along with Mahasthamaprapa, is one of the assistants of the Amitabha Buddha, serving as a kind of psychopomp, and a common depiction of him has him holding a lotus in his left hand. The most popular figure of worship in the Mahayana pantheon, this being is often depicted with eleven heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand arms. For ten points, identify this Buddhist deity, the bodhisattva of infinite compassion.

answer: The {Paranoid Style} in {American Politics}

Scholarly works cited in this text include David Brion's “Some Themes of Counter-Subversion,” and Norman Cohn's The Pursuit of the Millennium, which the author argues addresses the same phenomenon as this work. This work's second section takes as a “suitable point of departure,” a book written by John Robison directed against an organization founded by Adam Weishaupt, while later this work asserts that “Anti-Catholicism has always been the pornography of the Puritan.” In this work, a sermon preached by Jedediah Morse, as well as an excerpt from the Texas State Times are quoted as examples of the persistence of the titular phenomenon, and its other notable sections include a discussion of "Illuminism and Masonry" as well as an analysis of why the practitioners of the titular rhetoric feel dispossessed. Noting that the titular institution "has often been an arena for angry minds," and citing the John Birch society as an example of the titular practice "in action," for ten points, identify this essay by Richard Hofstadter which analyzes the rhetoric of conspiracy theories.

answer: Jose {Gervasio Artigas}

In Augusto Roa Bastos' Yo, el supremo, this historical figure makes a brief appearance when he is asked to save Tiku Alarcon, who had mistakenly entered the Tevego colony. In real life, this man promoted free trade through the Reglamento Provisioso and his army included a large contigent of Guarani Indians led by Andres Guacari. This man came to prominence as the leader of a unit known as the Blandengues, and he won a major victory at Las Piedras only to be expelled from his country by a Portuguese force following his defeat at Tacuarembo, marking the end of a period known as the Patria Vieja. This man's former officer, Juan Antonio Lavalleja, would eventually achieve the cause championed by this man when Lavalleja led the Thirty-Three Immortals in the liberation of a nation whose first president was Jose Fructuoso Rivera. For ten points, identify this patriot whose efforts to obtain independence for the Banda Oriental led to him being known as the father of an independent Uruguay.

answer: At {Melville's Tomb}

In a letter to Harriet Monroe, this poem's author acknowledged that it “may well be elliptical and actually obscure,” and answered her previous criticism of it by claiming that “as a poet I may... be more interested in the... illogical impingements of the connotations of words.” The word “monody” in the penultimate line of this poem may have been incorporated from a poem of that name by this poem's subject, and this poem's second stanza describes “the calyx of death's bounty giving back/ a scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph.” Samuel Hazo, the author of a book about this poem's author, argues that its third stanza, which describes a sea with “its lashes charmed and malice reconciled,” is stylistically connected to the poet's earlier works “Voyages,” and “Ave Maria,” while its last stanza claims that “Compass, quadrant and sextant contrive no farther tides.” Famous for its enigmatic assertion that the title figure “saw the dice of drowned men's bones bequeath an embassy,” for ten points, identify this Hart Crane poem, whose title refers to the resting place of the author of The Confidence Man.

answer: {odd perfect} number

Any number of this type must have the form n equals 12 m plus 1 or n equals 36 m + 9, for integer m, according to a theorem by Jacques Touchard. They would have the form a squared times quantity 4 b plus 1 raised to the power 4 c plus 1, a result demonstrated by Euler. These numbers do not exist if Ore's conjecture is true, and if one does exist, the work of Brent, Cohen, and Riele indicates that it must be greater than 10 to the 300 power. Arguments against the existence of these numbers include Sylvester's web of conditions and the Pomerance heuristic, and unlike a similar type of number, they do not correspond to Mersenne primes. For ten points, identify this type of thus-far undiscovered number, which equals the sum of its divisors and is not divisble by two.

answer: {propositional attitudes}

An article by Tyler Burge about the “content” of these philosophical concepts outlines the modality-dominated strategy and the cognition-dominated strategy for applying Frege's Principle to these concepts. An essay which opens with the example of Ctesias hunting unicorns was written by W.V.O. Quine about quantifiers and these philosophical concepts. A paper critical of these concepts refers to them as “the systematic core of folk psychology,” and argues that an eliminative materialist approach will allow us to transcend a system that employs these concepts. That paper was written by Paul Churchland, while Daniel Dennett has defended the use of these concepts by advocating that people take what he calls “the intentional stance.” Originally proposed by Bertrand Russell, for ten points, identify these mental states like believing and wishing, which indicate an individual's disposition toward a certain statement.

answer: On {Murder}, {Considered} as One of the {Fine Arts}

This essay was submitted to Blackwood's Magazine with the signature X.Y.Z., and accompanied by a note from the editor alleging that this work was no more “in earnest... than Erasmus in his Praise of Folly.” Presented in the form of a “Williams Lecture,” this essay opens with the assertion that “practice and theory must advance parri passu” before the author claims that he is all for virtue and that the title action is an “improper line of conduct.” This essay recounts how its author was drinking tea on Berners' Street with Samuel Taylor Coleridge when a neighboring house caught fire, while another incident retold in this essay involves a boxing match between an Englishman and a baker from Mannheim. In this essay Cain is held only to have been a “so-so” practitioner of the title action and this essay disapproves of those such as Miss Bland or Captain Donnellan, saying “Fie on those dealers in poison,” while those approvingly cited in it are the M'Keands and Mr. Thurtell, who had planned an instance of the title action involving a pair of barbells. For ten points, identify this satirical essay written by Thomas de Quincey, which advocates the aesthetic appreciation of killing.

answer: {Mahler's Symphony No.} 8 in E-flat {major} or {Symphony} of a {Thousand} [accept {Mahler's 8th} or anything {indicating clear knowledge}]

This work sets the “Ductore sic te praevio” to a double fugue, and the E-flat/B-flat/A-flat motif that opens the first vocal parts is repeated in the climax of the second section. A 1975 performance with the Vienna Philharmonic and Kenneth Riegel with Jose van Dam, among others, was recorded on video with a leaping Leonard Bernstein as conductor. Early on the key switches to D-flat on the words “Imple supema gratia,” while a violin solo accompanies the singing of “Infirma.” An intense march is set to “Hostem Repellas,” and trumpets mark the second surge of the “Accende lumen sensibus” theme just as an E-flat minor baritone solo closes. In the second part, the bass, baritone, and tenor roles are respectively Pater Profundis, Pater Ecstaticus, and Doctor Marianus. Mulier Samaritana and Maria Aegyptiaca are the two soprano roles in this work, which uses the Veni creator theme that begins its first section as the climax of its second section, which is a setting of Goethe's Faust, Part II. For 10 points, name this work of Gustav Mahler which is noted for its large ensemble.

The employment of one of these objects causes everyone around, including its user, to weep, after which its user promises a beautiful plumage to any bird that can gather his tears from the waters, a task accomplished by the duck. Another instance of this object's use causes warriors to lay down their arms, but that object is lost when the warship on which its owner is sailing is buffeted by winds and waves sweep this object overboard. After losing the first of these objects, its owner commissions an iron rake to look for it at the bottom of the sea, but after failing to find it, creates a second one of these objects from birchwood, using the hair of a virgin for strings.  That second example of this object is left behind after its original owner departs in a copper boat, while the first example of this object is made from the jawbone of a pike, and not even Lemminkainen can make good music from it. For ten points, identify this harp-like or zither-like instrument of Finnish folklore, employed by Vainamoinen in the Kalevala.

The occurrence of this event marks the peak of the visibility function tau. Large scale CMB anisotropies correspond to modes with greater than the horizon wavelength at the time of this event, and in general, the anisotropy spectrum peaks correspond to modes trapped at their maximum during this event. The early-stage Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect occurs immediately following this event. The Saha equation is used to show that this event occurs at a temperature of roughly 3600 Kelvin, or about 0.25 eV and a redshift of 1100, and this event precedes photon decoupling. After the occurrence of this event, photons free-streamed away from the surface of last scattering, forming the CMB. Occurring about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, for ten points, identify this cosmological event, the point at which the universe became sufficiently cool that stable hydrogen could form without being ionized.

answer: {Weltpolitik} or World policy [prompt on “{German foreign policy}” before mention, accept {German foreign policy} after {1897} or {German foreign policy under von Bulow} before either are mentioned]

Woodruff Smith offered a definition of this policy which argued that it was initiated primarily in support of the commercial and industrial sectors. This policy's major architect declared in what is known as the “hammer or anvil” speech that “we cannot allow... any foreign Jupiter to tell us: 'What can be done? The world is already partitioned.'” Manifestations of this policy included the annexation of Kiaochow as well as the commencement of construction on a railway to Baghdad. This policy was prosecuted by men such as Paul Kayser, who for a time headed the newly-established Colonial Department, as well Richard von Kuhlman, who would later serve as foreign secretary. Hallmarks of this policy included a naval arms race with England as well as colonial ambitions that resulted in two Moroccan crises. This policy's main architect, Bernhard von Bulow, claimed that it was motivated by the desire of a certain nation to secure for itself “a place in the sun.” Succeeding the earlier Realpolitik as practiced by Otto von Bismarck, for ten points, identify this imperialist foreign policy pursued by Germany after 1897, so named because of its large scope.
