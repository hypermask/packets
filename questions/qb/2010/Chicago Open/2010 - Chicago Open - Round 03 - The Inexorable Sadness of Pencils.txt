answer: Johann Wolfgang von {Goethe}

This thinker chronicled a debate between Cuvier and Saint-Hilaire in his Principles of Zoologic Philosophy.  He claimed that nature is driven by compensating loss because of “the budget of nature.”  He stated his disbelief in the use of experiments as proof and hinted at his dislike of math in science in his The Experiment as Mediator between Subject and Object. This thinker proposed an “osteological type,” an archetype upon which animals are based, in one work and discussed the homology of leaves in another; those are his Metamorphosis of Animals and Metamorphosis of Plants, respectively. His most famous attempt at science deals with the “physiological, physical, and chemical” forms of the title concept, which can arise from the action of a “turbid medium” and are represented on a triangle. For 10 points, name this author of Theory of Color.

answer: {interactive proof} [or {IP}]

John Watrous introduced the quantum variety of these systems and algebrization shows why they can't resolve the P=NP question. Shamir showed that the class representing these corresponds to PSPACE. Goldwasser and Sipser gave a way to establish a set lower bound using one of these. These systems are judged by their completeness and soundess which usually correspond to one third and two thirds respectively. Examples of these systems that don't give up any extra information are the zero knowledge variants and study of these gave rise to the PCP class. Only two rounds are needed for the Arthur-Merlin version of these systems, which use public coins. These systems generate a transcript of commit-challenge-response iterations, which take place between two probailistic Turing machines called a verifier and a prover, either of whom could be honest or dishonest. For ten points, identify these cryptographic systems in which one party tries to convince another party that they know a particular truth.

answer: The {Circle} of {Chalk} [or {Chalk Circle}; or {Hui}-{Lan Ji}]

After a character mentions a brotherhood that murders oppressors of the poor, the central character of this play gives a fur coat to her brother and throws a knife, which cuts the title object. An innkeeper is stiffed when drinks are bought to revive that brother, who along with the central character struggles through a snowstorm with two soldier-guards. This play ends when the new emperor is told of a dream where he ravishes the central character, whom he fell in love with when she drew the title object, but was unable to see for a year thereafter when Mr. Ma took her as his concubine. The merchant father hangs himself, leading Chang hi-Tang to be sold into a teahouse, but justice is dispensed when her son, who was placed in the title object, recognizes her rather than the murderess Mrs. Ma as the true mother. For 10 points, name this Yuan Dynasty play by Li Xingdao, of which a very loose “Caucasian” adaptation was made by Bertolt Brecht.

The narrator of this work recalls contemplating the paradoxical nature of the inscription, “Pax Intrantibus,” over a location where he meets his brother John Paul, who dies in the First World War. This work was revised by Evelyn Waugh, who published it as Elected Silence. At one point in this work, the narrator, a student Columbia University, accidentally walks in on a Shakespeare class taught by Mark Van Doren, which he decides to take; that narrator also takes a class in Scholasticism with Dan Walsh. Narrated by the author of The Sign of Jonas and Confessions of a Guilty Bystander, this work's first section tells of the narrator's life without God and corresponds to Dante's Inferno, while Paradiso is echoed by the narrator's life in the Trappist monastery at Gethsemani. For 10 points, name this autobiography of Thomas Merton.

This figure's death was mourned by a sixty-day period during which subjects had to shave their heads and only eat vegetables. Figures similar to this figure which were worshiped in a similar way included Mnevis and Bakh. After he was found, this figure could only be approached by women for forty days while feeding at Nilopolis. Kakau instituted the worship of this figure, who was conceived when his mother was struck by a moonbeam or a flash of light. He was identified by twenty-nine signs, including a scarab under his tongue and an eagle on his flank. The pharaoh was depicted destroying cities as this deity in the Narmer Pallette. Thought to be the ka of Ptah, this figure would be drowned if he lived more than twenty-eight years; after that period, a new incarnation of this god would be found from a herd of bulls. For 10 points, name this Egyptian bull deity who was merged with Osiris into the god Serapis.

answer: {Swabia} [prompt on {Alemmania}]

This region was once home to an alliance formed beteween 22 cities and a group known as the League of St. George's Shield. An earlier alliance of knights in this polity called itself the Schleglerbund and this region would later give its name to an administrative district known as its namesake Kreis, or "circle." One ruler of this region defeated an opponent at the Battle of Wahlwies, was the patriarch of the Ahalolfinger, and formed an alliance with the bishop Solomon III before being executed in 917. Another ruler of this region attempted to invade Italy but was stymied by Otto I, who secured the crowns of Lombardy and this region. This region gave its name to several alliances, the most famous being a 1376 league formed against German princes by 14 cities under the leadership of Ulm and Constanz. The Bertolds built a wave of castles in this duchy, which was ruled by the Houses of Babenberg and the Conradines before being taken over by two lines of the Hohenstaufens and Rudolf II of Hapsburg. For 10 points, name this successor state to Alemannia, which together with Franconia, Saxony, Bavaria, and Lotharingia was one of the five great "stem" duchies of medieval Germany.

answer: {untouchables} [accept {dalit} or {Harijan} before mention; accept {Scheduled Castes} before mention]

One prominent leader of this group set up a "People's Education Society," which operated under the slogan "Educate, agitate, organize." This group, together with others of its kind, was sometimes referred to as "Scheduled," and separate elections for those representing this group were abolished in 1932 via the Poona Pact. In a notable 1977 incident, nine members of this group were burned alive in Belchi, while a year later the demands of writers who belonged to this group and called themselves the Panthers to rename a university in honor of one of their leaders touched off riots against this group. Sometimes referred to as "children of god," or "Harijan," in 1956 200,000 members of this group took the "22 Vows" to convert to Buddhism under the leadership of Bhimrao Ambedkar. Representatives of this group included the youngest member of Nehru's cabinet, Jagjivan Ram, as well as the first member of this group to become president, Kocheril Narayanan. For ten points, identify this often-persecuted social group of India, the lowest caste sometimes known as "dalits."

This work posits that a certain group of people are forced to undergo “secondary adjustments,” and lists some of these as “ritual supplies” and “stashes.” This work is divided into four essays; the third discusses the “Underlife” and the second describes passing through a “betrayal funnel” as one of the early events of the “moral life” of its subjects. The final essay of this book is subtitled “Some Notes on the Vicissitudes of the Tinkering Trades” and argues that the central phenomenon adheres more to a “workshop model” than a “professional-expert model.” This work labels places which sequester people, follow strict schedules, and monitor behavior as “total institutions” and was drawn from observations of St. Elizabeth's Hospital. For 10 points, name this work subtitled “Essays on the Condition of the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates” and written by Erving Goffman.

answer: {Norman Foster}

He designed a ramp separating two glass domes stained with faux petals for the recently completed Elephant House of the Copenhagen Zoo. A subterranean geodesic theatre named the Samuel Beckett Theatre Project was among the uncompleted designs born from his early collaboration with Buckminster Fuller. He built a zig zag glass tower on top of the preserved stone façade of a Joseph Urban building in New York's Hearst Tower. This architect and his wife joined Richard Rogers and his wife in the abortive Team 4 firm, and his unbuilt designs include a massive self-contained structure in a conically helical cell built on the water off of Tokyo and named the Millennium Tower. He alternated two rows of light glass with one of dark glass in the spiraling façade of his building at 30 St Mary Axe, which has been nicknamed The Gherkin by London residents. He memorialized German reunification with a glass dome at the heart of his Reichstag renovations. For 10 points, name this British architect of the wobbly Millennium Bridge and 1999 Pritzker Prize winner.

answer: {Munn} v. {Illinois}

This case was compared with an incident in which Hugh Maher seized a piece of property from Harmon Spruance in an Edmund Kitch article entitled, “The Facts of [this case].” The court opinion for this case uses state constitutions and the Magna Carta to define the word “deprive” as used in the Fourteenth Amendment. That opinion also uses the examples of wharfingers and hackney-coachmen and quotes Lord Hale's De Portibus Maris to show that the legislation in question did not violate the due process clause. In the court opinion for this case, Chief Justice Waite argued that although Congress alone could regulate interstate commerce, the regulations in question in this case did not impair federal control, and agreed that a “virtual monopoly” was created by the owners of grain elevators. Overturned by the decision in the Wabash case, for 10 points, name this case arising from legislation passed due to the influence of the Granger movement, which decided that private property can be regulated for the public good, to the detriment of warehousers in Chicago.

Highly active catalysts for this reaction have been produced by using triflic acid to generate indenylidene (in-den-ILL-ih-deen) -metal complexes. The addition of 1,4-benzoquinones can prevent undesirable isomerization in this reaction, one catalyst of which has been modified to use a bidentate isopropoxy methyl benzene ligand originated by Hoyveda. Its machanism, which features a [2+2] metallocycloaddition, was proposed by Herison and Chauvin. One pentavalent catalyst for this reaction features trans-chlorine ligands and trans-tricyclohexylphosphine ligands, as well as a benzyl carbene, around a ruthenium center. For 10 points, name this reaction catalyzed by complexes named for Grubbs, which exchanges substituents across the double bonds of certain compounds.

answer: The {Conspiracy} of {Claudius Civilis} [or De {Samenzwering van Claudius Civilis}]

An Elias Martin painting about the visit of Gustav III to the Royal Swedish Academy of the Arts places this more notable painting in the background.  The four rightmost figures in this painting include a cheery man holding a goblet and a solemn turbaned man, whose front meshes in with the back of a standing figure with a wrinkled green cloak. Painted as a the centerpiece of an eight-work commission for the artist's late pupil Govert Flinck, this painting was originally set in a “sacred grove” before being moved to the interior of a dark, vaulted hall. The yellow glow of light on the table in this painting illuminates the swords of the leftmost characters, including the central one-eyed one who has a double layered blue and gold hat. Depicting some rebellious Batavians from Tacitus's Histories and celebrating the end of a war against the Spanish, for 10 points, name this painting, whose original version was the largest canvas of Rembrandt's.

answer: {DNA} barcoding

This technique's namesake "gap" occurs when a threshold does not sufficiently differentiate between variation and divergence. The DOME ID and ATIM algorithms have recently been developed for use alongside BLAST in identifying query sequences useful for this technique. AFLP and RFLP can be used to rule out false results obtained by this technique, which one study found would be inaccurate for 23 percent of eukaryotic organisms. While it can be carried out on most eukaryotes using the mitochondrial COI ("C-O-one") gene, the matK and rbcL chloroplast genes are used for plants. It was famously used to expose consumer fraud in which tilapia was substituted for white tuna and sheep's milk cheese made from cow's milk. For 10 points, name this technique that uses genetic markers to determine the species to which the genetic material belongs.

answer: {Russian Easter Festival Overture}

At one point in this piece, the tubas twice play a theme of F-F-F-E-D, which the French horns respond to with a B-F tri-tone. A cello soloist plays a theme of G-F-G-A-Bflat-A-G-F-E-F while the rest of the orchestra trills during this piece's first movement, andante lugubre. The composer of this work originally commissioned Count Golyenischev-Kutusov to write the program for the work, an offer which the count declined. This piece's second movement is strangely written in 2/1 time. Parts of this piece were inspired by the Obikhod hymns “Let God Arise, let his enemies be scattered” and “An Angel Cried Out,” and images depicted by this piece include the “light from the holy sepulcher.” Dedicated to the deceased Alexander Borodin and Modest Mussorgsky, this work was called The Bright Holiday by its composer. For 10 points, name this Rimsky-Korsakov piece written to celebrate Christ's resurrection.

This event directly resulted in the formation of the Monday Club, which issued its first public statement as a response to this event. During this event, the responsible speaker closed by noting that "The struggle is joined... for the minds of men," and argued that "what is now on trial is much more than our military strength. " After opening with a remark about a "golden wedding," referring to 50 years of nationhood of a certain country, the man who delivered this speech acknowledged symapthy with the listeners' interests and an understanding of their anxiety, before noting that "Ever since the break up of the Roman empire one of the constant facts of political life in Europe has been the emergence of independent nations." This speech prompted a response that claimed "we believe in balance," from Henrik Verwoerd, who also argued that "justice... does not only mean being just to the black man of Africa, but also to be just to the white man of Africa." Arguing that "We must all accept [national consciousness] as a fact and our national policies take account of it," for ten points, identify this speech delivered to the South African Parliament in February of 1960 by Harold MacMillan, whose colloquial name refers to a phenomenon that is "blowing through the continent."

In 2004, one of the discoverers of this object wrote a paper with Weisberg in which they confirmed that this object had a geodetic precession period of about 300 years. That paper also gave an improved measurement of a certain quantity to be 2.4056 times 10 to the minus 12 power seconds per second, and this objects discovery aided in the confirmation of predictions made by Peters and Matthews in 1963. This celestial object, which has the designation PSR B1913+16, has been in continuous observation since 1974, and it has been used to measure three post-Keplerian parameters: the Einstein timing, the rate of periastron advance, and the rate of change of orbital period. This last measurement taken from this object represents energy being lost to gravitational radiation and is one of the best current tests of general relativity. Discovered by one of its namesakes at Arecibo, for ten points, identify this doubly-eponymous object, the first binary pulsar to be discovered, which won its namesakes the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics.
