answer: {Mencius} [or {Mengzi}; or {Mengtzu}; or {Meng Ko}]

This thinker directly attacked a prior philosopher for claiming that "mankind is surely not to be helped by a single hair," and he believed that human faculties resided in a combined organ called the “heart-and-mind.” He wrote that a main task of philosophy is to analyze “giveaway actions,” his term for spontaneous, minor incidents in which the correct moral choice is made. He said that such actions occurs because humans are naturally possessed of “sprouts” of morality, leading to his four virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. This namesake of the fourth sishu was a student of either Zisi or the disciples of Zisi, providing a connection to the family of his tradition's founder. For 10 points, identify this fourth century BCE writer who achieved great popularity during the Tang Dynasty's Neoconfucian revival for his human nature-based interpretation of Confucius.

answer: {Dutchman}

At one point in this play, one character urges another to scream "meaningless shit" like "Red trains cough Jewish underwear for keeps!" In college, the protagonist thought he was Baudelaire, and a woman guesses that his name is "Morris the Hyena" after introducing herself as "Lena the Hyena." The protagonist is convinced that that woman knows his friend Warren Enright, and she has him invite her to Warren's party. The stage directions indicate that it takes place "in the flying underbelly of the city…the subway heaped in modern myth," and towards the end of the play the central female character begins dancing and mocking the protagonist, prompting him to unleash a diatribe against the white race. For 10 points, identify this one-act play about the encounter between the white woman Lula and the middle-class black man Clay, which was written by LeRoi Jones just before he became Amiri Baraka.

One of the simplest examples of this functional group reacts with carbonyl to give a base-resistant 1,3 dioxolane protecting group. At temperatures above seventy degrees Celsius, the Prins reaction yields one type of this functional group. Common protecting groups for this functionality include acetonide and benzylidene acetal. This functional group may be cleaved by reaction with periodate anion. One reaction that forms this functional group first forms an iodinium ion, then opens it with silver benzoate and works up with water; that reaction is named for Prevost. These compounds are formed in a reaction that reacts AD-mix alpha or AD-mix beta with a supporting (DHQD)2PHAL ligand and osmium tetroxide; another reaction forms them by a single-electron mechanism via magnesium metal, the pinacol coupling. Formed enantioselectively in a reaction named for Sharpless, for 10 points, name this functional group, wherein two adjacent carbons are hydroxylated.

answer: Jacques {Necker}

This person created a more democratic provincial assembly in Berry, ended the practice of mortmain in royal lands, and scaled back tax farming, all earning the ire of the nobility. The count of Maurepas exposed the deceptions in this man's Report to the King, which combined with his sympathies for the peasantry to lead to his first ouster. Earlier, he had married a woman who had previously broken an engagment to Edward Gibbon and who set up a leading salon, named Suzanne; together, the couple became the parents of Madame de Staël. He became prominent by writing a screed demanding restrictions on the grain trade and by euologizing Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who had served Louis XIV in an analogous role to this man. For 10 points, name this Swiss-born banker who failed to prevent the French Revolution with a constitutional monarchy proposal and was three times finance minister to Louis XVI.

answer: “{Politics} as a {Vocation}” [or “{Politik als Beruf}”]

This work proposes a solution that it credits to Moisey Ostrogorsky, though, at its end, it admits that the men it describes are nowhere to be found, and thus that "it is not summer's front which lies before us, but first of all a polar night of icy darkness and severity." This work gives Maecenas and Tammany Hall as examples of “enterpreneurs” who can use money to gain power, while naming the anti-democratic stances of the Catholic Centre Party and the Social Democrats as responsible for the impotence of Parliament in Germany. It proposes a “plebiscitarian” solution to the central problem of how bureaucracy can be subordinated to democracy, identifies tradition, legality, and charisma as the three sources of legitimation, and defines the state as the entity with a “monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force.” For 10 points, identify this speech, which was delivered, a year after a companion lecture on careers science, to graduates in Munich in 1918, and consists of analysis of the role of the professional party employee by Max Weber.

One scheme for solving these types of problems which is useful in classical situations is the Lax-Phillips formalism. If the Wightman conditions, which include relativistic invariance of states and the existence and uniqueness of a vacuum are satisfied, then the Haag-Ruelle theory may be used to solve quantum mechanical problems of this type. One result that gives a way of extracting a quantity relevant to processes of this type is the optical theorem. The probability amplitude associated with this process can be given as the Fourier transform of the potential involved in this process in accordance with the Born approximation. The initial conditions and outcomes of this type of process are encoded in an S-matrix. For ten points, identify this type of problem in physics, solving which typically involves finding the cross section.

This man had an affair with Sonali Das Gupta while making the documentary India, and one of his films opens with a former American soldier running his car into an old man; that old man is, contrary to their belief, not Saint Andrew, though he does give the title power to an object owned by Celestino. Another film sees Ginepro cut off a pig's foot and give it to a colleague, and that film notably used thirteen actual monks. Besides Machine to Kill Bad People and The Flowers of St. Francis, in one of his films the young Hitlerite Edmund throws himself off a building after poisoning his father. Germany, Year Zero was part of the same trilogy as Paisa and a film wherein Pina is shot while chasing after her arrested husband and Don Pietro Pellegrini is executed for working with the resistance.

answer: The {Spectator}

Slavoj Zizek argues that the constructs of “solidarity in guilt” and “participation in a common transgression” are modeled in this work's narrator's descriptions of public social violence, and Jurgen Habermas in The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere wrote that the public “entered itself into literature as an object” through this work. This work describes the “Ugly Club,” an exclusive men's organization that only admits extremely unattractive people. The first “number” of this publication includes its narrator's self-description as so taciturn that he was once mistaken for a Jesuit. Other characters in this publication and members of the narrator's namesake club include Sir Roger de Coverly and the foppish Will Honeycomb. The authors of this publication, which ran two to three issues per week between 1711 and 1712, also collaborated on a similar publication called The Tatler. For 10 points, name this publication written chiefly by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, whose near-silent narrator roams London observing the citizenry.

answer: {Toledo} War [accept {Michigan}-{Ohio War} and equivalents]

Immediately following this conflict, one of its participants tried to quell a group of Irish immigrants organized into “Hunters Lodges” who tried to break away in the so-called “Patriot War.” Following this event Benjamin Stickney was arrested under the Pains and Penalties Act, and this conflict came to a close after a meeting of the Frostbitten Convention. The only major injury of the war was the stabbing of Joseph Wood, and Joseph Brown's militia was ambushed in the Battle of Phillips Corners. Edward Tiffin's order led to the creation of the Harris Line and Lewis Cass ordered the creation of the Fulton Line leading to this conflict, which later resulted from a stalemate between governors Stevens Mason and Robert Lucas. Eventually, Andrew Jackson's Attorney General Benjamin Butler decided that the inhabitants of the namesake region were to vote on their preferred state. For 10 points, identify this boundary dispute from 1835-1836 over the namesake strip of a city currently located in Ohio.

answer: {Franz Rosenzweig}

One essay by this thinker considers a person who becomes paralyzed by philosophical questioning, and is entitled “The Little Book of Healthy and Sick Human Understanding.” Another work by this thinker was written partly on postcards sent to his mother from the hospital, and contains an account of what this thinker called “speech-thinking.” In analyzing a fragment of Hegel's writing originally given the name “An Ethics,” this philosopher concluded that he had found what he called the “Oldest System-Program of German Idealism.” This philosopher's first major work also dealt with Hegel, and argued that Hegel's conception of politics had grown out of Hegel's attempts to reconcile individual subjectivity with the objective nature of the world. This thinker criticized his contemporary Martin Buber for reducing divinity to a human projection in an essay titled “Atheistic Theology,” and he edited for publication the last great work of his teacher Herman Cohen entitled Religion of Reason out of the Sources of Judaism. For ten points, identify this Jewish philosopher, the author of Hegel and the State and The Star of Redemption.

In addition to "Silent Noon," he wrote an internal monologue in which the speaker imagines the title character waking with his gold coins in her hair. That poem, in which the speaker contemplates the "lazy laughing languid" title prostitute, is entitled "Jenny." The parenthetical "I saw her smile" and "I heard her tears" begin and end the final stanza of his most famous poem, in which the title character "lean[s] out / From the gold bar of heaven," gazing at her earthbound lover. For 10 points identify this poet and painter who wrote the sonnet sequence The House of Life, as well as "The Blessed Damozel."

These molecules have been found to rescue photoreceptors from degeneration in models of retinitis pigmentosa, and one example of them has been implicated in many leukemias as a downregulator of p16-INK4a. “Water wires” folded into these molecules may serve as proton shuttles that enhance their activity. The only one of these that requires a small-molecule activator to function regulates the production of glucosamine-6-phosphate. Another notable example of these has G5, G8, and G12 motifs key to its function in a magnesium ion in its active site. These molecules can catalyze Diels-Alder reactions in vivo and hydrolyze their own phosphodiester bonds. For 10 points, the spliceosome might be and “Hammerhead” is one example of what RNA molecules that possess catalytic ability?

Frank Zappa adored this composer, going so far as to spend his birthday money to call him after being inspired by a piece for winds and double bass that lacks this composer's characteristic aggressive percussion. That piece is this composer's only work with multiple movements, each of which opens with a phrase on a solo instrument. This composer of Octandre wrote the influential essay “The Liberation of Sound” about his theory of “sound-masses” and set Paul Verlaine's “Un grand sommeil noir” to music. Another of his works features such unusual instruments as the guiro, sleighbells, sirens, and recordings of roaring lions; that work is called Ionisation. This composer was commissioned to write a “score” to a World Expo installation managed by Iannis Xenakis and designed by Le Corbusier, the Phillips Pavilion, and he also wrote a short work for solo flute that is titled after the mass-to-volume ratio of platinum. For 10 points, name this French musique concrète composer of Poème Electronique and Density 21.5.

For a collection of open subsets of a compact Hausdorff space where each of the subsets has this property, their intersection also has this property according to the Baire Category Theorem. For a Hausdorff space X, the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem gives the conditions under which a subalgebra of C(X,R) has this property. If every nonempty open set in a topological space has this property, then the space is said to be hyperconnected. A set is called "nowhere this" if the interior of its closure is empty. On a metric space X, a set Y has this property if and only if every element in X is the limit of a sequence of elements in Y. For 10 points, identify this topological property that describes a set whose closure is the whole space to which it belongs, as exemplified by the rational numbers on the reals.

One force in this war was led by Poppadius Silo, who lost a decisive battle to Metellus Pius. This conflict saw the renaming of the Paeligni capital Corfinium by one side, which set up its own senate and consulate, and forced Lucius Julius Caesar to push through a previously unpopular political proposal in the form of the Lex Julia. Winning commanders for Rome included Pompeius Strabo, Rutilius Lupus, and, as in the Jugurthine War twenty years prior, both Sulla and Marius. Its immediate cause was the assassination of the tribune Marcus Livius Drusus, who had proposed extending citizenship to all Italians.

He wrote a poem that reads, in its entirety, "The red spots on the planet Jupiter are three-hundred-year-old hurricanes," and another reads, "At the end only so many will remain as can sit around a drum." He described these "micropoems" in a letter to the artist Tess Jaray, and they were paired with Jan Peter Tripp's lithographs depicting pairs of eyes in the collection Unrecounted. A trip to Corsica inspired his collection of essays Campo Santo. The narrator of one of his novels seeks out Thomas Browne's skull, prompting one of the historical meditations that punctuate the subtitular "English Pilgrimage." Another novel focuses on the titular architectural historian of Czech descent, who escaped from Nazi Germany to Britain as a child.
