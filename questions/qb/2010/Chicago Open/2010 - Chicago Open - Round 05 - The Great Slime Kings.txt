answer: {tetragonal lattices} (do not accept {orthorhombic})

This structure has Wigner-Seitz cells of either an elongated dodecahedron with four hexagonal faces or a truncated octahedron with eight hexagonal faces, depending on whether its critical ratio is more or less than the square root of two. This structure is found in the ordered phase of taenite, an iron-nickel compound found in meteorites, but the more common random phase taenite has a different structure. The high temperature superconductor BSCCO ["bisko"] has this structure, and an insulating form of YBCO has this structure when it is made with low amounts of oxygen; one subtype of this structure is also exhibited by the titanium ore rutile. A transition from a cesium-chloride lattice to a lattice of this type at low temperatures can be explained by the Jahn-Teller Effect, wherein, in order to prevent unequal occupation of degenerate energy levels, one axis of the lattice is distorted. For 10 points, name this crystal lattice structure formed from stretching a cubic lattice in the z direction.

answer: {Fischer}-{Tropsch} Process

An early theory of the mechanism of this process using a cyclopropylidene intermediate was disproven by Hoel when allenes formed instead of the desired product. An important side reaction to this process is the Boudouard Reaction, and the catalyst used in this process is poisoned by hydrogen sulfide. One widely accepted mechanism used in this process is based on the formation of a carbene and includes a 1,3 hydride shift, originally proposed by Maitlis. The ratio of its input compounds can be controlled using the water-gas shift reaction, and this process typically uses an iron or cobalt-based catalyst. An important center for its use is the Sasol plant in South Africa, and the distribution of its products can be modeled with the Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. For 10 points, name this reaction which uses carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produce hydrocarbons.

answer: {Sense} and {Sensibilia}

In one part of this work, the author asserts that if a church is camouflaged to look like a barn, then what we see is "a church that looks like a barn," and not "an immaterial church." This work's penultimate section concerns what the author calls the "very extraordinary position," that "material-object statements are as such not conclusively verifiable." This work's third section attempts to remove the conflation of the word "illusion," with "delusion," and earlier it is suggested that the "[plain man]... is hardly deceived at all." Compiled by G. J. Warnock from lectures given at Oxford in 1947 under the general title "Problems of Philosophy," this work opens by arguing that some works, including Ayers' The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge, "bite off more than they can chew," and that certain doctrines regarding perception are undecidable. For ten points, identify this book, whose title puns on both its subject matter and the name of it's author, J.L. Austin.

In the last novel in which this character appears, he saves another character by hacking off her hand after that character is accidentally pinned underwater by a harpoon. This character pens a manuscript about a former lover only to have another character insert his own commentary into it known as the Interlinear. When first introduced, this character is living on a Greek island and recalling his affair with the prostitute Melissa, for whose child he is caring. This character becomes the friend of Pursewarden, who commits suicide after revealing a conspiracy to David Mountolive, and his other friends include the Jewish mystic Balthazar. This character becomes enchanted with the woman who is the subject of the novel Moeurs and is herself the wife of Nessim, and witnesses the shooting of Capodistria during a duck hunt. The lover of two characters that title novels in which he appears, Justine and Clea, and a representation of his creator Lawrence Durrell, for ten points, identify this main character of The Alexandria Quartet.

answer: {biofilms}

These structures' proliferation may depend on transposon-mediated development of a specialized form of adhesin. The cidA gene, which codes for a holin protein, facilitates the formation of these structures, and the ica gene and mu phage are among the elements that can cause phase variation in them. Homoserine lactones function as chemotactic agents in a process called quorum sensing that leads to the formation of these structures in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These structures are implicated in otitis media and Legionnaire's disease, and genetic mutations leading to highly viscous respiratory mucous prevent cilia from clearing out these formations in cystic fibrosis. These structures, which frequently form on artificial joints, develop when bacteria in a planktonic state randomly adhere to an existing layer of organic materials adsorbed to a surface. For 10 points, identify these microorganismal aggregates exemplified by dental plaque.

answer: {Seven Sacraments}

Bernini reportedly knelt before one painting in the second group of these works, which depicted a mysterious veiled woman at the far left, though the rest of the scene simply showed the ceremony of Joseph and Mary. Another work in the second group reverses the composition of its artist's earlier depiction of The Death of Germanicus and shows a man in a yellow robe with candle in hand hunching over a dying Roman soldier. That second group currently resides in Scotland's National Gallery as part of the Sutherland loan and was commissioned by a man for whom the artist earlier painted Israelites Gathering the Manna. The last painting in the first group was destroyed by the fire at Belvoir Castle, where that group resided after being commissioned by Cassiano del Pozzo. The second group, however, is still intact and had been commissioned by Paul Freart de Chantelou. For 10 points, name these two series of paintings by Nicolas Poussin depicting scenes of marriage, ordination, penance, and eucharist.

answer: {triple alpha} process [accept {Salpeter Process} before end]

An important explanation for this process is a resonance energy state for the product near 7.7 MeV. It is the first reaction to fall out of equilibrium at the high temperatures of a supernova shock front, and helps explain the brightness of some non-main-sequence stars not covered by two related processes. A key intermediate in this process is a beryllium-8 atom, and the final product is stabilized by the release of a gamma ray. This process drives the rapid burning of helium known as the "helium flash" in lower-mass giants, and this process is responsible for stellar nucleosynthesis as it can produce elements above atomic mass 12, a fact which was elucidated by Fred Hoyle. The main source of energy in red giants, for 10 points, name this process in which helium nuclei join to form carbon, sometimes named after Edwin Salpeter.

answer: {Pale Fire}

The fourth and final canto of this poem mentions the poet's earlier works Dim Gulf, Night Rote, and Hebe's Cup, before stating that "this transparent thingum does require / some moondrop title."  In another section of this poem, the narrator experiences "the attack, the trance / or one of my old fits," during which he envisions a tall white fountain.  That near-death experience occurs as he is giving a talk at the Institute of Preparation for the Hereafter.  A discussion of a young female character in this work's second canto includes the lines "Why overstress / the physical? She wants to look a mess. / Virgins have written some resplendent books." That character, the poet's daughter, is later described leaving a failed double date, getting off the bus early at Lochanhead, and drowning in the lake.  This poem opens with the line "I was the shadow of the waxwing slain," and was written on a set of 80 index cards during the last twenty days of the poet's life.  For 10 points, identify this work of John Shade, annotated by Charles Kinbote, a 999-line poem which appears in a novel by Vladimir Nabokov.

answer: {Bhima} (the "a" is not {always pronounced} in {Hindi})

This figure wrestled Jarasandha, defeating his opponent by tearing him in half, so that his brother could carry out the Rajusuyana yajna. This man killed the elephant Ashwattama so that brother could lie to Drona.  He was called Vrikodara, or "wolf belly" for his huge appetite. In one story, this man ate an entire cart full of food intended as tribute for Bakasura, then killed the demon. As a child, this figure was poisoned and then dumped in a river by his cousins; he was saved when venom from a snakebite neutralized the poison.  He would later vow to break one cousin's thighs with his mace, and drink the blood of another cousin, Dushasana, after they humiliated his wife. He once met a monkey blocking his path, and was unable to move its tail; that monkey, Hanuman, was nominally this man's brother, since he was born after Kunti invoked the wind god Vayu.  This figure had a half-Rakshasa son with Hidimba, named Ghatotkacha.  For 10 points, identify this elder brother of Nakula and Sahadeva, a member of the Pandavas along with Yuddhistira and Arjuna.

answer: A {Manual} for {Manuel} (or {Libro} de {Manuel})

One character in this work often says the word "bloop" whenever she wishes to "mentally cross over to the opposite sidewalk." Another character in this work raises a purple lapsus mushroom which a group of people watch grow 8 millimeters in five minutes, and another character claims to have a condition "like the hiccups, except stronger," which makes him stand up in a movie theater and let out a long scream. In addition to that man named Patricio, characters include Heredia who makes fake packages of used matches and cigarettes. The book contains pieces of news such as the death of a guerrilla fighter who died of malnutrition and the escape of five women from the Cordoba jail. The plot involves attempt to capture a "Vip" and use him as leverage to force freeing a group of political prisoners in South America. Assembled as a scrapbook for the title baby, the son of Susana, for 10 points, name this book in which a group of Argentinians in France attempt to carry out the Screwery, a work of Julio Cortazar.

answer: {Preludes}

Witold Lutoslawski wrote 5 works for clarinet and piano in a "dance" variety of this form. Frank Martin's sixth work in this genre uses the "BACH" motif and is marked "andante grazioso" and "dolce leggiero"; that piece is among the eight he composed in this genre.  "Song of Ecstacy in a Sad Landscape" and "Bells of Anguish and Tears of Farewell" are among the eight by Olivier Messiaen, while Charles-Valentin Alkan's Opus 31 is a collection of works of this type and includes a piece called "The Song of the Madwoman on the Sea Shore." Rachmaninov collected ten of them in his Opus 23 and thirteen of them in his Opus 32, though he also wrote a work of this type that is the second piece in his opus 3 Morceaux de Fantaisie and is in C-sharp minor. One collection of them begins with a work marked Agitato in C Major and ends with a work in D minor, thus ascending the circle of fifths across a group of pieces that includes "Raindrop." For 10 points, name this type of work, twenty four of which constitute Chopin's Opus 28.

answer: War of {Breton} Succession [prompt on "{Hundred Years}' {War}" before mention]

One battle during the conflict saw John Bramborough die during a set thirty-person battle royale against the forces of Jean de Beaumanoir after ravaging the town of Josselin. Pope Clement VI attempted to end this conflict after battles of Rennes, Nantes, and Vannes with the Truce of Malestroit, which was broken three years later when French outposts were attacked. One claimant in this conflict, Charles de Blois, was supported by Philip IV, but was captured at the Battle of Roche-Darien by forces supported by Edward III, while another claimant in this conflict won a major victory at Cadoret but died in the same year, leaving his wife, Joan of Flanders, to champion the claims of his son. This conflict was sparked by the death without a clear successor of John the Good, and was concluded with the Treaty of Guerande, in which Charles V recognized the claim of John IV de Montfort to a certain duchy. Concluding after forces under Bertrand du Guesclin were defeated at the 1364 Battle of Auray, for 10 points, name this war that is sometimes considered a phase of the Hundred Years' War fought over succession claims to a region in Northwestern France.

answer: {Ghaznavid} dynasty

One member of this dynasty brought the scholar al-Biruni to his court, and artistic achievements during this dynasty included the introduction of the ground plan of four eyvan, or open vaults, as exemplified by the palace at Lashkari Bazar. Located across the Oxus from the territories of the Qarakhanids, this dynasty's history was written by Bul-Fazli Bayhaqi and was the first major work in New Persian, a language encouraged by this dynasty's rulers. This dynasty ended when the Ghurids overran its capital of Lahore in 1186, to which its sultan Masud I had retreated following the battle of Dandanqan in 1140. A successor state to the Samanids, this dynasty's greatest ruler was Mahmud, who patronized Firdausi, warred with the Buyids, and repeatedly clashed with Jaipal, the Raja of the Punjab, during his 17 expeditions that resulted in Islam being brought into the interior of India. Founded by Sebuktigin, for ten points, identify this Turkish dynasty situated in Khorasan, Afghanistan, and northern India, which took its name from its capital, an Afghan city.

answer: The {Endless Column} [or The {Column without} End]

Barbu Brezianu has pointed out the similar-looking structure on the right side of Amedeo Modigliani's Portrait of Paul Alexander, and the idea for this work was first proposed by Barnet Hodes. The largest member of the ensemble titled A Child in the World, Movable Group was likely used as a study for this work.  This work was created in the midst of its artist's "African" period, which also included The First Step and Little French Girl. This work inspired a Ligeti etude whose composition was based on the 16 rhombus-like modules and 1 half-module, and it appears on the Târgu Jiu coat of arms. Created as a tribute to Romanians who died in WWI, this is, for 10 points, what Brancusi work which is not, in fact, infinitely tall.

answer: {Sefer ha}-{zohar} [accept The {Book} of {Splendor} before mention]

Two chapters of this work consist of a debate between a merchant and a scholar regarding the location of the foundation stone, while another section of this work introduces the idea of ten regions of divine emanation. The later sections of this work include a series of 70 interpretations of the first word of Genesis, while its last section, entitled The Faithful Shepherd, interprets the rationale for the commandments. Major interpreters of this work, the name of which means Book of Splendor, included Isaac Luria, and the most famous section of this work is probably its first, which is called The Hidden Midrash. Containing many meditations on the divine name as well as the ten sefirot, this work was most likely composed by Mosheh de Leon in the 13th century, though tradition credits its writing to Shimon bar Yohai. Strongly influenced by Gnosticism and written in Aramaic rather than Hebrew, for ten points, identify this mystical work, the primary text of the Qabbalah.

answer: {Virginia Resolves}

The most detailed account of the introduction of this proposal may have been recorded by the chevalier d'Annemours, who later published it in his Journal of a French Traveler. Against the wishes of moderates like George Wythe, the speaker who introduced this proposal opened with the inflammatory claim that "in former times, Tarquin and Julius had their Brutus, Charles had his Cromwell." The last two points of this proposal, including one which argued that anyone attempting to justify a certain piece of legislation "shall be deemed an enemy of His Majesty's colony," would eventually be withdrawn, but a rump of 39 legislators passed its first five points, including one which claimed that "the General Assembly of this colony have the only... exclusive right... to lay Taxes... upon the Inhabitants of this Colony." Touching off similar resolutions in eight other colonies, the passage of this proposal caused Francis Fauquier to disband the House of Burgesses, preventing that body from sending a representative to a meeting in New York in 1765. For ten points, identify this series of seven resolutions proposed to the Virginia colonial legislature by Patrick Henry in protest of the Stamp Act.

answer: The {Death} and {Life} of {Great American Cities}

This work's third section posits three forms of money: governmental, conventional, and shadow-world, and suggests that they all lead to "cataclysmic, rather than gradual" changes. This work warns against the presence of bars and theatres in low-density "grey areas" and suggests that long streets diminish the intensity and intricacy of the foreground. This work suggests that storekeepers serve as self-appointed public characters who provide "eye protection," providing children with a safe non-matriarchal play environment for children. That public security is only possible if the streets are always occupied, which requires mixed-use neighborhoods, which are advocated in this work. This work rejects the rationalist derivation of principles like "separation of uses" and "urban renewal," which reject the complexity and chaos that inhere in the title entities, a position advocated by modernists like Robert Moses. For 10 points, name this work of urban theory by Jane Jacobs.

This man acquired his royal title due to his marriage to Anne Beauchamp, and he was made Captain of Calais, which he defended for five years from Spanish marine invasions. This man quarreled with a former ally when that ally refused a French alliance, preferring one with Burgundy instead, and married Elizabeth Woodville, the widow of Lord Ferrers. Buried in the family mausoleum after his death at the Battle of Barnet, this man had earlier helped foment the rebellion of Robin of Redesdale and had captured his former patron at the battle of Northampton. Forces under this man's command were aided by John Mowbray in his victory at the bloodiest battle of the war for which this man is best known, the Battle of Towton, and this man was the victor in the first Battle of St. Albans, while he lost the second battle of the same name to Margaret of Anjou, just before the aforementioned victory at Towton helped put Edward IV on the English throne. For 10 points, name this powerful English aristocrat whose tendency to depose and later resupport the candidacies of  Henry VI and Edward IV to during the Wars of the Roses gained him the epithet "the kingmaker."

Tanya Luhrmann has written about this concept in  "modern culture" in a work titled after the persuasions of one variety of it.  Lee Siegel's work in India led to his 1991 work titled for the net of this concept, while a 1997 Bruce Kapferer work studying the Sinhalese discusses human conjunction based on this concept. One of Stanley Tambiah's essays from Culture, Thought, and Social Action uses Austin's terminology to conclude this concept is analogic and could easily be identified as an illocutionary act; that essay is named for the "form and meaning" of this concept. Another work discussing this concept opens a section about an "ethnographic theory" of it by examining "the meaning of meaningless words" and later looks at coefficients of intelligibility. That work recounts how Bagido'u inherited authority over a system of towosi called Kaylu'ebila that exists in Omarakana and discusses the formulae related to this concept in its last part. It also examines a version of this concept related to "growth" and the stimulation of shoots and leaves.
