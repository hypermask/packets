answer: Inca {Viracocha}

This deity was worshipped in the festival of Camay, during which offerings were thrown into a river in the hopes that they would find their way to this god. In one story, this god created a race of giants by breathing into large stones, but irritated with the stupidity of his initial creations, broke them and replaced them with human-sized people. In another story, this figure and two sons traveled North, Northeast, and Northwest, named all the plants, and told the humans which were cultivable and edible, after which they departed by crossing the ocean. This god's name meant “Sea Foam,” and commoners were not allowed to say it. Sometimes syncretized with the god Pachacamac, the worship of this deity may derive from the worship of Thunupa as practiced by the Aymara. The chief god of the Quechua pantheon, for ten points, name this father of Inti and Inca creator god.

answer: Marcus {Furius Camillus}

This man began his military career under Postumius Tubertus, and Marcus Manlius Capitolinus rebelled against this man, which resulted in a law forbidding patricians from having homes on the Capitoline hill. During a siege, this man introduced the notion of a paid army, and his other reforms included his acceptance of the Licinian-Sextian laws. This man ended the siege of Falerium when he refused to take hostage boys who had been led to him by their teacher. Lucius Apuleius forced this man into exile, and he was recalled only after Pontius Cominius scaled the Capitoline hill, and, in the process, gave the Gauls an idea for an attack that would be foiled by some watchful geese. This man captured another city after the waters of the Alban lake were diverted, and, in addition to seizing Veii, this man forced the Gauls under Brennus out of Rome after their victory at Allia. For ten points, name this man grouped with Themistocles in Plutarch's Parallel Lives, who is known as the second founder of Rome.

answer: {Piano quintet}

Roy Harris wrote a three movement composition in this genre, which opens with a passacaglia and closes with a fugue. Alfred Schittke wrote one on the death of his wife, and that work uses a waltz on the BACH theme and features a passacaglia in the finale, while Nikolai Medtner's only work in this genre was in C major and was published posthumously. A prelude marked Lento opens Shostakovich's venture in G minor, and the main theme of the allegro ma non troppo last movement combines with the main theme from the Allegro Brillante first movement for a double fugue finale in Robert Schumann's work in E-flat major. One of these works in A major has a fourth movement consisting of variations on the composer's Lied Die Forelle. For 10 points, identify this type of composition, exemplified by Schubert's, which is nicknamed “Trout.”

answer: {Cosmic Background Explorer}

This experiment made a more detailed measurement of the same signal as the RELIKT-1 experiment, which had operated in a band centered on 37 GHz. One instrument utilized during this experiment mapped the absolute sky brightness in 10 wavelength bands, while another instrument was a differential radiometer, whose measurements would later be repeated by experiments such as TopHat and BOOMERanG. In addition to the DMR and DIRBE, another instrument using in this experiment was the Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer, which demonstrated that a certain phenomenon was a black body with temperature of about 2.7 Kelvin. Succeeded by the WMAP satellite, for ten points, identify this satellite experiment which measured the spectrum and the small-scale anisotropy of the CMB, and won a Physics Nobel in 2006 for George Smoot and John Mather.

answer: The {Geographical Pivot} of {History}

One section of this work notes that transport of goods by sea involves at least two more transactions than those going by land, so there is a boundary where the costs become equal and that, for British and German coal, this line is somewhere in Lombardy. Another section of this work uses Wellington's campaign from Torres Vedras in the Peninsular War as an example of what future wars might look like, while the signing of the Treaty of Bjorko partially justified this work's fears. This work begins by describing the bifurcation of central Asia into steppe and forest and notes that there are no great rivers in the region to facilitate transportation outside of it. Positing that European culture has been shaped by successive invasions by tribes from the steppes, this work concludes with a warning about possible alliances between Germany and Russia. More famous for its division of the world into inner and outer crescents, for ten points, name this work that posits that historical forces revolve around a heartland region now controlled by Russia, a work by H. J. Mackinder.

answer: decarboxylation

One reaction to accomplish this forms a namesake thiohydroxamic ester and either uses tert-butyl mercaptan or chloroform; that reaction is named for Barton. Another requires a beta- electron withdrawing group and generally employs lithium chloride in DMSO. That ionic reaction named for Krapcho contrasts with the believed radical pathway involved with the treatment with bromine and tetrachloromethane of silver salts, a reaction named for Hunsdiecker. This reaction is the final step in the pyridine-employing Doebner modification of the Knoevenagel reaction and of the malonic ester synthesis of cyclic carboxylic acids, where it occurs upon the addition of aqueous acid and heat. This operation turns pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the citric acid cycle. For 10 points, name this reaction that often features the loss of carbon dioxide, wherein a COOH group departs.

answer: {Pigeonhole} Principle [accept {Dirichlet's Box Principle} before “For {ten} points”]

This statement can be used to prove that a sequence of integers with general term xn where n = ab + 1 contains at least one monotonic sequence with a + 1 terms, a specific case of Dilworth's Lemma. In addition to the Erdos-Szekeres Theorem, this statement is used to prove a regularity test for a language involving the ability to insert an arbitrary number of characters into a string, the pumping lemma. This statement forms the basis of radix sort, while the Fubini principle states that, if there is an average of x packets in each one, at least one of this principle's namesake structures must have more than x items. For ten points, name this principle that informally states that given x containers and more than x objects to place into those containers, one container must have more than one object, which was first stated by Dirichlet.

answer: {Ramon} [or {Raymond}] {Lull}

This thinker's theory of the elements is contained in his Ars scientiae, or “The Tree of Science,” while in another work, this theologian argued that anyone could come to see the truth of Christianity through intense contemplation, and Nicholas of Cusa would later adapt many of the ideas set forth in this man's Book of Intellectual Ascent and Decline. In addition to writing the Libre del Contemplacio en Deu, this man argued that Muslims were close to Christians than other non-believers because they accept the virgin birth of Mary. This man made that argument in a theological novel entitled Blanquerna, which ends with a section entitled the “Book of the Lover and Beloved,” which contains 365 aphorisms partially lifted from al-Ghazali. The author of Disputatio clerici et Raymundi phantastici, for ten points, identify this 13th century Christian mystic from Catalonia who styled himself Christianus Arabicus.
