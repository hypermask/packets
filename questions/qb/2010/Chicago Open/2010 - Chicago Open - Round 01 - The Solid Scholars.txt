answer: {Giovanni Bellini}

This man used a flowered curtain as the background for his portrait of Teodoro of Urbino as St. Dominic. This man created a series of secular paintings for Vincenzo Catena: one of them shows a bunch of children prancing around on an unstable boat that seats a woman with a large blue sphere; another shows a young man falling out of the huge sea shell on a traveler's back. Besides Fortune and Falsehood, which are amongst his Four Allegories, the influence of Antonello da Messina's oil techniques is apparent in two works that depict the Virgin in a blue mantle, immersed in golden dust and enthroned under an illuminated golden apsidiole. Besides the Frari Triptych and San Giobbe Altarpiece, one of his works lies in the Camerino d'Alabastro of Alfonso I D'Este and depicts scenes from Fasti wherein Silenus' donkey prevents Priapus' seduction of Lotis and Hermes lies against a barrel as everyone carouses. For 10 points, name this Venetian painter, whose student Titian modified his depiction of The Feast of the Gods.

answer: Battle of {Rocroi}

The end of this battle saw the losing side mistakenly open fire as a delegation from the winning side approached to receive their surrender, which resulted in the massacre of more than half of the losing side's infantry. The decisive maneuver in this battle occurred when the cavalry of the winning side cut through the infantry middle, isolating an elite infantry corps from its German and Italian allies. A premature attack by Francois de l'Hopital nearly cost the eventual victors this battle, but eventually cavalry led by Jean de Gassion, neutralized the cavalry of the Duke of Albuquerque and took position to cut off reinforcements from General Beck. Fought northeast of Reims in a namesake forest, this battle saw 26,000 men under Don Francisco de Melo lose decisively to a French army of 22,000 commanded by the Duke d'Enghien, who would later come to be known as the Prince de Conde. A crushing defeat for tactics employing the tercio formation, for ten points, identify this 1643 battle of the Thirty Years' War which ended Spanish military preeminence in Europe.

answer: Treaty of {New Echota}

During a reading of the text of this treaty by Benjamin Currey, the roof of the house containing negotiators caught fire, which one bystander thought “emblematical of the indignation of Heaven at the unlawful proceedings within.” Hugh White's vote in favor of this treaty helped him win the state of Tennessee in the following presidential election. General John Wool resigned his command in protest instead of enforcing this treaty, which was negotiated by William Carroll and John Schermerhorn. John Walker Jr. was assassinated for supporting the policy advanced by this treaty, which was signed by Elias Boudinot, John Ridge, and Stand Watie. The signing of this treaty prompted John Ross, the leader of a group opposed to this treaty, to collect more than 14,000 signatures attesting to its invalid signing and submit them to Lewis Cass. This treaty resulted in the payment of five million dollars in exchange for a tribe's lands east of the Mississippi River. Signed on December 29, 1835, and strongly supported by Andrew Jackson, for 10 points, name this treaty which relocated the Cherokee, whose enforcement led to the Trail of Tears.

answer: {cirrus} clouds

The so-called “infrared” variety of these objects are usually filamentary structures most easily seen at high Galactic latitudes that were discovered by the IRAS mission. These structures can appear as finger-like fall streaks that are similar to virga, and they are commonly responsible for moonrings and sundogs. The term “uncinus” is used to describe these structures when they display a hooked filament pattern known as “mares' tails,” which resemble commas. They form through glaciation, and under near-saturation conditions, broad bands of these structures can be produced from contrails. Supercooled water droplets that freeze into ice crystals compose, for 10 points, what wispy structures, the most common high-level clouds?

answer: “To {Autumn}”

In a letter to J. H. Reynolds, the author of this poem notes that it was inspired in part by the warm look of some stubble fields. In the second stanza of this poem, the addressee is pictured “sitting careless on a granary floor, / Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind,” as well as "by a cyder-press with patient look... [watching] the last oozing hours by hours." This poem follows an ABABCDEDCCE rhyme scheme and its final stanza states that “the small gnats mourn” “in a wailful choir” and that “gathering swallows twitter in the skies” in describing the title goddess's music. The title goddess is said to conspire in loading and blessing “with fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run,” and she is described as the “close bosom-friend of the maturing sun.” For 10 points, name this Keats ode addressing the “season of mists and mellow fruitfulness.”

answer: {Achaemenid} dynasty [accept word forms]

One member of this dynasty was said to have murdered his brother Bardiya, who would later be impersonated by Gaumata the Magician in a revolt against that ruler. This dynasty claimed descent via two lines from an ancestor named Teispes, and the founder of the elder line of this dynasty first came to power as the ruler of Anshan. Architectural achievements of this dynasty include the construction of the Hall of One Hundred Columns, and a member of this dynasty sent Scylax of Caryanda on an expedition to India.

answer: {two}-{dimensional} [or {planar}]

The Orr-Sommerfeld equation analyzes the stability of parallel viscous flows by considering only perturbation of this type, a restriction that can be motivated by use of Squire's transformation. Geostrophic turbulence exemplifies this type of turbulence, in which enstrophy is conserved due to the absence of vortex stretching and energy goes to large scales. An incompressible fluid flow of this type can be described using a stream function. The quantum Hall effect was first observed in an electron gas of this type, and Pólya proved that the origin may never be revisited during a random walk on any lattice of higher order than this configuration. A zero external field solution for the Ising model with this configuration was published by Onsager. Unperturbed orbits adopt, for 10 points, what sort of configuration which can be described using polar coordinates or Cartesian x,y coordinates?

answer: {Ideology} and {Utopia} [or {Ideologie und Utopie}]

This book argues that relativism falsely holds all knowledge to be illusory, and instead claims that all knowledge is partially true, and can be synthesized into wider historical truth, which its author calls "relationism." This book discusses Thomas Munzer's belief in the "Eternal Present" to analyze Anabaptistism as an example of "orgiastic chiliasm," one of the four types of revolutionary consciousness it delineates along with liberal-humanitarianism, conservatism, and socialist-communism. In another section, the author borrows Alfred Weber's terminology to describe a "relatively classless stratum" as the "socially unattached intellegentsia." and he quotes Lamartine as saying that examples of one of the titular concepts of this work are often "premature truths," in a section concerned with the titular ideas and "the problem of reality." This work distinguishes between "particular" and "total" types of the first title concept, and contrasts that concept, which it defines as attempting to understand reality in terms of the past, with the second title concept, which transcends the present and tends to "shatter" the prevailing order. For 10 points, name this book which outlines its author's sociology of knowledge, written by Karl Mannheim.

answer: {Cristero Uprising} or Rebellion

Some of the worst violence during this conflict took place in isolated villages near Lakes Patzcuaro and Chapala, and government reprisals in response to this conflict included the execution of men like Miguel Pro Juarez. Units on one side of this conflict often called themselves the Army of National Liberation, and leaders units of that army included Enrique Gorostieta, Simon Cortes Vieyra, and Luis Granada. Shortly before the end of this conflict, government efforts to suppress this rebellion were compromised due to an attempted coup by General Gonzalo Escobar. Crucial outside aid in the resolution of this conflict was provided by Dwight Morrow, who brokered the agreement that ended this conflict between Ruiz y Flores and Provisional President Emilio Portes Gil, who had assumed office following the assassination of Alvaro Obregon by a sympathizer of this rebellion. This conflict was partially sparked by a certain group's protestations against the Code of 1917, in response to which Elias Plutarco Calles ordered the deportation of foreign priests and the closing of Church schools, resulting in this rebellion by devout peasants. For ten points, identify this revolt in support of the Catholic Church in Mexico, which took its name from the fact that its members claimed to be followers of “Christ the King.”
