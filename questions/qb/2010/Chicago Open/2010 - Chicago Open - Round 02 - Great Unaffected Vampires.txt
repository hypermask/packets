answer: {Postmodernism}: The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism

As an example of the titular kind of architecture, this work contrasts the Westin Bonaventure building in Los Angeles with Le Corbusier's pilotis. This work ends with a call for a "new and global type" of "cognitive mapping," and its author admits that his "rhetorical strategy," has been to "[systematize] something... unsystematic, and [historicize] something... ahistorical." In this work, Gary Becker's "totalizing approach," which argues that economics "provides a unified framework for understanding all human behavior," is critiqued in a section titled after this work's title concept and "the Market." This work analyzes the self-representation of the 1950s through the work of Philip K. Dick in a chapter titled "Nostalgia for the Present," while Claude Simon and Alain Robbe-Grillet are discussed in the fifth chapter, "Reading and the Division of Labor." The introduction of this work argues that its titular concept is an "attempt to think the present historically," and is "what you have when the modernization process is complete and nature is gone for good."  For ten points, identify this work which refers to its titular concept as "the cultural logic of late capitalism," the best-known book by Frederic Jameson.

answer: {Elizabeth Costello}

In one novel in which this character appears she sets the main character up with a blind nymphomaniac named Marianna. In another work, she discusses an experiment involving an ape named Sultan who is forced to find ways to obtain out of reach bananas and champions the “fullness of being” in animals' lives in a debate with Thomas O'Hearne, a philosophy professor at Appleton College. The final chapter of the best-known novel in which this character appears recreates Hugo von Hofmannsthal's “Letter of Lord Chandos to Lord Bacon” and follows an episode in a Kafkaesque prison camp in which she survives judgment by likening herself to a frog. Also appearing in The Lives of Animals and Slow Man, this character is likened to Doris Lessing for her novel The House on Eccles Street, a retelling of Ulysses from Molly Bloom's perspective, in the novel of which she is the title character. For 10 points name this Australian author who appears in three works by J.M. Coetzee.

answer: {kinetic isotope effect}

Lawrence Que (CHAY) employs a two-state model of this phenomenon in his work on non-heme oxo complexes. Circumstances under which this phenomenon might remain constant despite free energy increases are given by the Westheimer-Melander hypothesis. Schalley and Felder described a steric form of this phenomenon that arises in rotaxane deslipping. Unusually high and temperature-dependent values of this phenomenon are attributed to a tunneling mechanism. Two different types of this phenomenon are related by a power law with exponent one point four four two in the Swain equation. A secondary form of this phenomenon occurs with values around one wherein orbital hybridization changes affect the zero-point energy. An inverse type of this phenomenon occurs in many reductive elimination mechanisms due to a stabilizing agostic interaction. For 10 points, name this phenomenon wherein substitution of an atom with a different mass number leads to a change in a reaction rate, often exploited to learn more about reaction mechanism.

This man had Basil the Physician burned at the stake, and defeated the Pecheneg tribe. This ruler's domestic policies included the expansion of the pronoia system while his foreign policy achievements included a negotiation of a truce with Sulayman ibn Qutalmish of Konya. This man represented his nation at the Council of Piacenza, and he had earlier served as a general under Romanus IV Diogenes. His reign was challenged by his son-in-law Nikephoros Bryennius, who had become convinced to try for the crown by this man's wife, Irene Ducas. Although one rival was forced to give up his territorial gains to assist Henry IV, that rival, Robert Guiscard, defeated this man's forces at the Battle of Dyrrachium. This son of Anna Dalassena took power after deposing Nikephoros III, and his reign was famously chronicled by his daughter Anna. His letter to Robert of Flanders helped inspire Pope Urban II to call for a certain event. For 10 points, identify this Byzantine emperor and founder of a namesake dynasty, who ruled during the First Crusade.

The first chapter of this work contains a reproduction of "Wheatfield with Crows" with the instruction to "look at it for a moment. Then turn the page," after which the reader sees identical reproduction with the note that this was "the last picture that Van Gogh painted before killing himself." This work notes that publicity is "the last moribund form" of post-Renaissance European visual art, rather than its supplantation; the page on which that sentence appears juxtaposes the images of an advertisement for Armstrong flooring and an anonymous 19th-century painting of Carlo II of Parma and his family. Venus of Urbino, Olympia, and La grande odalisque are used to demonstrate that women are the subjects of the gaze and men are the performers of the gaze in the third among the four text-and-image and three image-only sections of this book, which was inspired by ideas from "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." For 10 points, name this book of essays, meant to accompany a BBC television series of the same name, that questions typical interpretations of the European painting tradition, whose assembly was coordinated by John Berger.

An inscription found at Husn al-Ghurab contradicts the widespread tradition surrounding this man's death by claiming he was killed in battle as opposed to riding his horse into the sea and drowning to avoid capture.  Ibn Khaldun says this man's name was given due to his curly hair, and he came into power after dispatching the usurper Khani'ah Yanuf Dhu Shanatir.  This king instigated a series of wars first by killing traveling Byzantine merchants and later by massacring the Ethiopian population of the cities of Mocha and Zafar, as well as due to an incident in his own city of Najran, leading to Justin I arranging for an attack by proxy from Kaleb of Axum.  In Najran, this man had offered the Christian population a choice of conversion or death in response to the treatment of his religious brethren elsewhere.  For 10 points, name this king of Himyar famous for his conversion of much of Yemen to Judaism.

One section of this work makes the claim that, in order for a person to achieve freedom, he must translate it into the external sphere, ensuring that it would exist as an idea. Another section of this book claims that people  reflect their own subjectivity of others in order to respect them, forming moral life, but eventually integrate that with ideas of non-interference to form ethical life, which comprises the third sphere of the title concept. The second section of this book ends with the observation that the mind of the world exercises its right in the 'history of the world which is the world's court of judgment. The final section of this book discusses the claim that "The state is the march of God through the world" and holds up the Germanic state as the final form of states, completing the dialectic.

answer: {Shelley} v. {Kraemer}

A controversy in this case arose from the Solicitor General's office declining to list the Jewish authors of its Amicus Curiae brief. The decision in this case referenced ordinances overturned in Harmon v. Tyler and Buchanan v. Warley, and it used Virginia v. Rives to support its central holding. The Supreme Court declined to extend this case to contractual abdication of one's right to free speech in United Egg Producers v. Standard Brands, and an Ohio court notably refused to apply this case to the probation of a will in Shapira v. Union National Bank, in which the decedent conditioned his sons' inheritance on their marrying Jewish women. The test established in the opinion essentially asks whether a valid ordinance could be enacted prohibiting the conduct contractually proscribed, which courts have used to limit this case's holding to racial discrimination. For 10 points name this 1948 case that held that judicial injunctive enforcement constituted state action, thereby outlawing racially restrictive covenants.

The p63 transcriptional target Perp is a primary regulator of the assembly of these structures. The protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate has been found to stabilize these patch-like structures, and protein kinase C causes a switch from their low- to high-affinity state. ERBIN, a protein governing cell polarity, binds armadillo and armadillo homolog proteins associated with these structures. Along with a similar structure whose major functional protein is integrin, they associate with plectins. Plakoglobins link these structures' major constituent proteins, cadherins. Pemphigus vulgaris results when antibodies attack proteins in these structures on keratinocytes, causing blistering as the upper layers of the epidermis to separate from the basal layers. For 10 points, name this type of cell-cell junction that appears primarily in cardiac and epithelial tissue.

answer: {homotopy} [accept word forms]

A space which has only one nontrivial group of this type is called an Eilenberg-MacLane space. According to a theorem by Hurewicz, there exists a homomorphism between homology groups and groups of this type. If a map between two cell complexes induces an isomorphism between all groups of this type, it is known as an equivalence of this type according to Whitehead's theorem. Two spaces are equivalent under this relation if they are both contained in some larger space of which they are the deformation retracts. This relation induces an equivalence class among all paths beginning and ending at the same point, leading to the definition of the fundamental group, which is the simplest algebraic group of the type that bear this relation's name. For 10 points, name this type of mapping, a continuous deformation from one topological space to another.

The protagonist imagines slaying the royal horses and hounds and dancing over their corpses. This proves prophetic, since she dies during an increasingly intense dance witnessed by her sister Chrysothemis, who refused to help her find the sacred axe necessary to exact vengeance. That axe is taken up by the title character's long-lost brother in this work, which was its composer's first collaboration with Hugo von Hofmannsthal.

answer: {Robert Kett's} Rebellion

A revisionist study of this rebellion was completed in 1859 by Frederick Willima Russell, who suggested that its organizer's "great misfortune had been to live before his time," and contemporary accounts of it include one by John Cheeke entitled "The Hurt of Sedition." This revolt may have originated from a quarrel between its namesake and a man named Sergeant Flowerdew, and it began following a feast at Wymondham after which its namesake convened about 16,000 men on Mousehold Heath. After refusing a pardon brought by the Marquis of Northampton, participants in this rebellion fought with Northampton's troops on St. Martin's Palace Plain, resulting in the death of Lord Sheffield. This rebellion directly caused the downfall of Edward Seymour, the Protector and First Duke of Somerset, who, influenced by Hugh Latimer and a party known as "the Commonwealth's men," had been attempting to mitigate the policies that gave rise to this revolt. The participants in this revolt were eventually defeated at Dussindale by John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and its namesake, along with his brother William, was executed in December of 1549. For ten points, identify this uprising that began in Norfolk, England during the reign of Edward VI as a reaction against enclosure.

answer: {scale factor} [accept a or a of {t} before mention]

Using the geodesic equation, it is possible to show that the magnitude of the three-momentum depends inversely on this quantity. Because the early universe is radiation-dominated, its energy density scales as the fourth power of this quantity, while number densities of particles after decoupling are proportional to its third power. The Hubble rate is defined by the time-derivative of this quantity over itself, and it appears as a prefactor to the spatial component in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. The exponential increase in this quantity forms the basic idea of the theory of inflation and one plus the redshift is defined as the ratio between this value in the past and this value today. Usually denoted by the lowercase letter a, for ten points, identify this time-dependent quantity, a parameter which multiplies length scales to account for the effects of cosmic inflation.

One character exclaims, “Those gloves! Those eternal gloves!” at the beginning of this work, and a recurring dispute in this work arises over the affection of a milkman. A murder plot is foiled in this play when the target notices that the phone is off the hook, which distracts her from drinking a cup of drugged tea that later causes the death of another character. Two characters in this play are referred to as “the distorting mirrors of respectable society,” while a third is jailed as a result of a letter written by Claire.
