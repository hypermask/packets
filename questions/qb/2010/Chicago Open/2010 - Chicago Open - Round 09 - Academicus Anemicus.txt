answer: The {Cardsharps}

The eldest figure in this work wears a slightly open pale gold vest with a floral pattern over a shirt of gold and black pinstripes, and it was heavily promoted by Prospero Orsi after its artist grew weary of painting flowers for Giuseppe Cesari. It inspired a similar work by Georges de la Tour depicting a man and two women with feathers in their hats. This work brought its artist to the attention of Cardinal del Monte and it joins The Fortune Teller as its artist's second 1594 genre painting. It shows a backgammon board on a red table and a mustachioed man using two gloved fingers to signal to a dagger wielding boy. That boy draws papers with hearts and clubs in, for 10 points, this painting of a young man getting cheated, by Caravaggio.

answer: {David Benatar} [{Note}: {Despite extensive research}, it is {completely unclear how} or {whether Michael} and {David} and {Solomon Benatar} are {related}, other {than} the {fact} that they {collaborate} on articles.]

This man claimed that by asking the government to provide them antiretroviral medication, HIV-positive patients are advocating a “hemi-nanny state.” He collaborated with a neuroscientist of the same last name on articles such as “A Pain in the Fetus” and “The Ethics of Neonatal Male Circumcision,” and in another work, he cited male-only military conscription, the tendency for women to win custody battles, and infrequent reporting of sexual assult against boys as examples of the titular “second sexism.” One book by this thinker discusses the asymmetry between the ideas that the absence of pain is good even if nobody experiences that good and that the absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is someone for whom that absence is a deprivation. This man promulgated his most notable idea in that book, in which he rejects hedonistic, desire-fulfillment, and objective list views of why existence is good. That book also concludes that using assisted and artificial reproduction is equivalent to treating children as means, and that because all lives include some suffering, coming into existence is always a harm. For 10 points, name this South African bioethicist and antinatalist, the author of Better Never to Have Been.

answer: {Sonogashira} coupling

This reaction is the terminal step of the Miller synthesis of the natural product harveynone, and one difficulty in elucidating its mechanism lies in explaining how one reagent might be deprotonated by a base as weak as triethylamine. A natural side-process to this reaction is a Glaser coupling, and it directly superceded the Castro-Stephens reaction, one of whose catalysts this process generates in situ. This reaction, whose rate-limiting step is a transmetallation that links its two catalytic cycles, allows alkynes to trade a terminal hydrogen for an R-group on an aryl or vinyl halide. For 10 points, name this palladium-catalyzed modification of the Castro-Stephens reactions.

answer: {Alzheimer's} disease

This disease is genetically associated with the presence of deleterious intron variants of or the underexpression of SORL1. Low blood progranulin and elevated Dkk-3 are two of approximately 18 blood protein level signifiers that could be used for diagnosis of this disease. A recently discovered more effective treatment for it involves combining memantine and the more traditional donepezil. Hyperinsulinemia might contribute to this disease, the late onset of which correlates with the presence of two alleles of the Apo variant E4, by promoting the hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-stabilizing proteins that form damaging tangles. Clinical trials on a common drug for this disease, rivastigmine, show that butyrylcholinesterase may play a role in this disease in addition to a more commonly implicated neurotransmitter esterase. For 10 points, what is this disease marked by a shortage of acetylcholine, the most common form of dementia?

One figure by this name was the son of Alpheus and the brother of two figures identified by Hegesippus as the sons of Klopas, though he is better known as being identified with a figure with this name whose feast day is May third and who is often depicted as a man holding a book. Paul mentions only Peter and that figure with this name seeing Jesus after the resurrection, and he mentions meeting him while he was the leader of the Christians in Jerusalem; that figure is titled “the Just.” Another figure by this name was one of the “Sons of Thunder” along with John and was with John and their father on the seashore when he was called to serve as one of the Apostles; that figure, the son of Zebedee, also supposedly saw the Virgin Mary while preaching on the banks of the Ebro River. One figure by this name was known as “the Lesser,” while the figure of this name known as “the Greater,” became the patron saint of Spain. For ten points, identify this name shared by several Biblical figures, one of whom was the half-brother of Jesus.

This work's author described how he was influenced by Ibsen in that like in Ibsen's The Wild Duck, this work documents the past so that the present can be comprehended in fullness. The theme of money recurs in this work in the guise of a neighbor who abandons medical research for general practice, as well as in the pointed mention of the value of the protagonist's home as fifteen thousand dollars. One character in this work broods over his guilt at losing a company in battle and remarks that while he was dying every day, another was killing his boys. That character proposes to the daughter of a man who is serving prison time despite the fact that that daughter, Ann is technically still “Larry's Girl.” That title is given to Ann by Kate, Joe's mother, whose wrath the protagonist escapes by shooting himself at the end of this work. For 10 points, name this play about Joe Keller, who sold faulty aircraft parts to the military, written by Arthur Miller.

This politician was the prosecutor in the case which barred evidence obtained by coercion from court cases. In addition to serving as the prosecutor in Brown v. Mississippi, this senator was chair of the Senate Ethics Committee, where he led the investigation of Thomas J. Dodd in 1967 for misuse of funds which resulted in this senator's writing of the first Senate ethics code. One proposal involving this senator would have allowed him to listen to Nixon's tapes in order to verify the accuracy of White House summaries of them; Archibold Cox was discharged for disagreeing with this plan which was known as this senator's namesake compromise. This senator's membership on the Senate Armed Forces Committee from 1969 to 1980 resulted in his receiving the nickname “Father of America's Modern Navy.” For 10 points, name this Democratic Senator from Mississippi nicknamed “the Conscience of the Senate” who served from 1947 to 1989 before being replaced by Trent Lott, and who has a nuclear aircraft carrier named after him.

answer: {Field Programmable Gate Arrays}

One technology for permanently specifying the function of one of these devices is “anti-fuse” technology, in which high resistance links are “blown” to create shorts. Since they can be used to implement any function, these devices are more flexible than application-specific integrated circuits, but at the cost of requiring much more area and power. Unlike CPLDs, most of these devices use static RAM, meaning that they are volatile, and programming on these devices is usually done through the use of a hardware definition language such as Verilog. They consist of a switch matrix interconnecting an array of configurable logic blocks, from which these devices derive their name. First introduced by Xilinx, for ten points, identify these devices which can be used to quickly implement many different kinds of digital circuits.

answer: {Genpei War} [accept {Jisho}-{Juei War}]

According to a historical text called The Mirror of the East, the pretext for this conflict was the call to arms of a prince left out of the line of succession. During this conflict, a man exiled during a previous rebellion saw his first defeat at the Hakone Pass. That leader's forces continued to lose major battles in this conflict until his cousin defended a fortress at Hiuchiyama during the battle of Tonamiyama. Chronicled in the Azuma kagami, the first major battle of this conflict ended with Yorimasa's death by seppuku after he failed to defend Prince Mochihito; that was the battle of the Uji river. This conflict arose between two factions that had earlier clashed in the Hogen and Heiji disturbances. This conflict began after Daijo Daijin Kiyomori placed a two-year-old on the throne over Emperor Go-Shirakawa's son and it ended with Emperor Antoku's death at the naval battle of Dan-no-ura. Resulting in the establishment of the first bakufu, for 10 points, identify this conflict between the Taira and Minamoto clans that led to the Kamakura Shogunate.

answer: {Symphonies} of {Johannes Brahms}

Every movement in the third of these works ends quietly, and that work's first movement also introduces a C/E-flat/high-C/E motif that serves as a “motto” theme. The composer of these works also notably replaced the standard third-movement scherzo in that third work, instead writing a poco allegretto waltz in C minor featuring the work's most distinctive theme, a lilting C/D/E flat, G/F/D that is first stated in the cellos and is famously restated by solo French horn. The fourth of these works has an allegro giocoso third movement in C major marked by the use of piccolo and triangles, and famously opens with the violins playing chains of descending thirds and ascending sixths. That work ends with an Allegro energico e passionato movement in the home key of E minor that steals a theme from the cantata Nacht dir, Herr for a chaconne consisting of thirty-two variations. For 10 points, name these four works, the first of which is sometimes called “Beethoven's tenth.”

answer: Edmund {Husserl}

One work by this thinker describes a triple stratification based on pure morphology of judgments, logic of consequences, and logic of truth. That work by this author describes how Aristotle brought out the concept of form in order to describe logic as the development of pure reason. In addition to that work subtitled An Attempted Critique of Pure Reason, this author wrote a work which discusses how an observer will believe that familiar individuals have similar viewpoints to that observer. In addition to discussing the egocentric viewpoint, that work by this author also describes how empathy constitutes an intersubjective experience. This author's most famous work describes how Bolzano failed to realize the internal equivalence between logic and mathematics and how Kant failed to understand how the laws of logic are analytical propositions; instead, this author argued that analytic logic is an absolute norm presupposed by rational knowledge.

answer: Electorate of {Saxony}

This region became a hereditary posesssion under the Liudolfing dynasty, and in the 10th and 11th centuries it was held by the Billung family. One leader of this polity recovered Havelberg in the Wendish Crusade before being the first member of his family to rule this polity. That leader, Alfred the Bear, was the first of the House of Ascania to rule this state, which passed from the Ascanians to Frederick II the Valiant in 1422. This state's independence was restored at the Treaty of Hubertsburg after it was defeated at the Siege of Pirna and forced to fight for Prussia at the beginning of the Seven Years' War. The Lauenburg branch of this polity's rulers were eventually absorbed by Hannover, and following the extinction of this polity's Wittenberg line of rulers in 1422, it passed to Frederick I the Warlike. This state's Elector was elected King of Poland despite the opposition of France and Spain in the War of the Spanish Succession. That Elector was the son of another Elector of this state nicknamed “The Strong,” Augustus II, and this state lent an alternate name to the Ottonian dynasty, which was based here. For 10 points, name this electorate with capital at Dresden.

Following this man's death, his position was assumed by his brother Frederick Henry, whose continuation of this man's strategy resulted in such spectacular triumphs as the capture of Bois-le-duc. Much of this leader's military success was due to he advice he received from the philosopher and mathematician Simon Stevin, though despite that success he was still pressured into negotiating the Twelve Year Truce. Against a political rival who promoted Erastianism, this man became the champion of the Counter-Remonstrants, and with that rival and William Louis, he formed a triumvirate that ruled his country for 30 years. This man's first military successes included a victory at Nieuwpoort in 1601, as well as the previous capture of his ancestral home of Breda, which reverted to the Spanish just before this man's death in 1625. The raising of levies to support the waardgelders prompted this man to finally arrest and execute his one-time ally Jan van Oldenbarnevelt.

answer: {strangeness} [accept {strange quark} or {s quark}]

In 1971, Bodmer demonstrated that matter possessing this property could have a higher binding energy than iron-56. In the baryon octet diagram, straight horizontal lines connect particles that have identical values for this property. The existence of this property was hypothesized due to the discovery of a particle which instead of a lifetime of 10 to the minus 23 seconds had a lifetime of 10 to the minus 10 seconds. This property is possessed by the lambda, xi, sigma, and omega baryons, which are known as hyperons, and together with the c, b, and t numbers as well as the baryon number, this quantity combines to form the hypercharge, which is not conserved in weak interactions. Related to the total charge by addition to the isospin in the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula, for ten points, identify this quantity, a quark flavor possesed by k-mesons which with the charmness forms the second quark generation.

An introduction to this work by Steven Lukes argues that it provides a “sterile prescription for the human sciences” and refers readers to the author's review of Labriola and a debate with Seignobos. This work, which touches on the lack of patriarchy among the Slavs, who are nonetheless Aryan, also suggests that “normal” constraint is that which may be maintained without violence, unlike constraint that arises merely from one person being stronger or richer. This work's conclusion rejects the manner in which the Italian school has assimilated one subject of this work, like psychological phenomena, into the “general properties of organized matter”; thus, it suggests that its perspective is not materialist. The preface this work's author wrote to its second edition claims that one subject is a “[manner] of acting or thinking” that has a “coercive influence on the consciousness of individuals”; that preface notes that one of its most controversial propositions is that “social facts must be treated as things.” For 10 points, name this work outlining the way that sociology should be conducted, written by Emile Durkheim.
