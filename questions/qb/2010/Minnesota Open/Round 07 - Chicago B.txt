answer: Gilbert Newton {Lewis}

In his work with non-ideal solutions of electrolytes, this man introduced a term which is given as molality times charge squared summed across all ions in a solution. Parameters representing electrostatic bonding and covalent bonding are utilized in an equation which gives the enthalpy change of a reaction involving substances named for him; that equation is the Drago-Wayland equation. He co-names a rule governing the contribution of components to the (*) fugacity of an ideal solution.  In his paper The Atom and the Molecule he introduced a notation in which non-bonding electrons are represented in pairs away from the lines indicating electrons shared between two atoms. For 10 points, identify this American chemist who developed an acid-base theory involving electron pair donors and acceptors and drew some dot structures to visualize the pairing of electrons in compounds.

answer: {Victor Frankl}

This man claimed that mental health depends on a tension between the present and what should happen called “noö-dynamics”. One work by this psychologist argues that anticipatory anxiety, hyperintention, and hyperreflection were symptoms of neurotic “vicious cycles” that could be reduced using the “paradoxical intention” technique. Another work by this man suggested the creation of a “Statue of Responsibility” to compliment the Statue of Liberty. This author of The Doctor and the Soul believed that creativity, interaction, and change of attitude allow men to overcome such “existential vacuums” as the “Sunday neurosis”. In his most famous work, this man claimed salvation only occurs “through love and in love” and argued that men always have a (*) spiritual choice to undergo the title action. That work eventually spawned the “Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy” and is a reaction to this man's experiences in Nazi concentration camps. For 10 points, name this Austrian psychologist and Holocaust survivor introduced "logotherapy" in the book Man's Search for Meaning.

answer: {Born}-{Oppenheimer} approximation

This statement fails to predict a stiffening of the Raman G peak in graphene as the band gap is close to zero in graphene. This statement is not useful at conical intersections since such points have coupling singularities, while the derivation of this statement relies on conditions governing the decomposition into rotational, vibrational, and coupling terms that were introduced by (*) Eckart. The potential energy surfaces generated by this statement use nuclear position as parameter. Because the nuclei are much heavier than the electrons yet have the same kinetic energy, the central assumption of this idea, that the electronic motion and the nuclear motion in molecules can be separated, is generally valid. For 10 points, identify this approximation for calculating the wavefunction of a complex particle, named for two physicists.

Mereschowky's hypothesis is the earliest formulation of this theory, and apicomplexans are organisms in which the product of this process is highly reduced due to transfer via EGT. The first group thought to diverge after this process is unique because it has a retained the capacity to produce peptidoglycan, though the presence of multiple membranes in other groups has led to the theories suggesting that it has occurred (*) serially. Other evidence for this theory includes the presence of nucleomorphs in the cryptomonads and the presence of phycocyanins and phycoerithrin in the antennae of light-harvesting phycobilisomes. For 10 points, identify this theory proposed to explain the development of phyla such as glaucophyta, red algae, and green algae, in which cyanobacteria were phagocytosed and gave rise to a light harvesting organelle.

answer: sodium [or {Na}]

A neutral cloud composed of atoms of this element lies in the orbit of Io. Atoms of this element in the mesosphere are excited by lasers tuned to 590 nm, and the Rayleigh backscattering thus formed is treated as an artificial beacon in adaptive optics systems. The broadening of the doublet of this element in the presence of an applied B field caused the broadening of the doublet in the first observation of the (*) Zeeman effect, and the D1 and D2 Fraunhofer lines characterize that doublet. This metal contributes a solvated electron when placed in ammonia, which helps reduce aromatic rings in the Birch reduction. The Castner-Kellner method was the commercial method of producing this element until it was replaced by the Downs process. For 10 points, identify this element which is transported across plasma membranes by a pump that exchanges three of its ions for two potassium ions.
