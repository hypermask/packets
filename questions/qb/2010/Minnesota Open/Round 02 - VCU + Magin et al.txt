answer: {Jay Gatsby's house} [accept equivalents, like {James Gatz's house}]

This building, which is once described as a “huge incoherent failure”, was constructed by a brewer who unsuccessfully tried to force his neighbors to thatch their roofs. One resident of this building is seen doing “liver exercises” on the floor and reluctantly agrees to play “The Love Nest” on the piano. It also contains a study decorated in the Adam style, which is used by a man who is compared to a “regular Belasco!” Five crates of oranges and lemons arrive at this building every (*) Friday, as ordered by its owner, who pulls out piles of unused silk shirts while giving a tour. This building's library contains books with uncut pages that are examined by a man with large glasses, while its residents include Ewing Klipspringer. Its swimming pool is the scene of a grisly murder committed by George Wilson. For 10 points, name this building which is the setting of uproarious parties attended by Jordan Baker and Nick Carraway, the home of the protagonist of an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel.

answer: {Llywelyn} [{liu}-{ell}-{in}]

One king of this name attempted to confuse an opposing army by putting the shoes on his horse backwards, but he was betrayed to the pursuing forces of John Giffard by a treacherous blacksmith. Another king of this name attempted to secure the succession for his son through an oath at Strata Florida Abbey and tried to engineer peace by marrying his daughter Gwladus [goo-lad-us] the Dark to two marcher lords. The king of this name who lost at the Battle of Bullith was the son of (*) David, and grandson of the “Great” king of this name, who opposed King John much as the later king of this name opposed Henry III. That latter prince of Gwynedd was the only ethnic Welshman to be named Prince of Wales. For 10 points, give this common name of two thirteenth-century Welsh kings, the latter of whom was known as "the last leader" or "ap Gruffydd."

answer: {Franck}-{Hertz} Experiment [Either order is {okay}]

Teich, Saleh, and Soler proposed a version of this experiment to study the anti-bunching of light. Calculations using conservation of angular momentum showed that events observed in the data must correspond to a transition into the 3P1 [three-P-one.] The collecting plate in this experiment had a slight negative charge, and its investigators saw sudden drops in the (*) current at evenly spaced intervals of 4.9 electron volts when a beam of electrons was fired at a glass envelope filled with mercury. Inelastic collisions were the cause of the drops in the current,  For 10 points, identify this experiment which showed that the electrons occupy discrete quantized states, which won its investigators the 1925 Nobel prize in Physics.

One work by this philosopher posits a person who has color and size but no particular color or size in his attack on the second and third forms of abstraction found in Arnauld and Nicole's Logic or the Art of Thinking. In another work, this man questioned the sensibility in NOT thinking the moon is "a plain lucid surface, about a foot in diameter". This thinker claimed that resemblance only applied to ideas in his "likeness principle. Another work by this man uses the examples of a tree and a cherry to illustrate what Andre Gallois terms this man's (*) "Master Argument". That statement refuted the distinction between primary and secondary qualities and claims that objects cannot exist apart from the mind. For 10 points, name this Irish philosopher of A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge and Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous, who held that “to be is to be perceived”.

answer: {Gran Chaco} War [accept La {Guerra} de la {Sed} or The {War} of {Thirst} until mentioned]

Near the end of this war, the president of the losing country was overthrown by his generals while visiting their headquarters, causing him to remark it was their only successful military maneuver of the war. One side in this war employed White Russians Ivan Belaieff and Nicholas Ern as fortification and cartography specialists. The numerous casualties due to lack of water have caused this conflict to be known as the (*) “War of Thirst.” The losing side in this war unsuccessfully utilized Vickers tanks under the command of Hans Kundt, whose officers could not communicate with their mostly native troops. That side, under President Daniel Salamanca, was desperate to obtain ocean access after losing the War of the Pacific. For 10 points, name this 1930's war in which Paraguay defeated Bolivia to gain control of the namesake region.

answer: Claude {Debussy's} twelve {etudes} [or L. 136]

The middle of the fifth one of these pieces is marked "very equally rhythmed". The composer declined a request from Gabriel Faure to perform them in public, claiming that "there are too many keys” and that “I don't remember where the pedals are." The first one opens with a repetitive series of five-note scales, explaining the sarcastic dedication “after Carl Czerny”, while the rigid four-note groupings of the sixth one led the composer to promise "awkward and acrobatic" use of the thumbs. That suggested avoidance of the thumbs gave the sixth of these pieces the title (*) “for eight fingers”. The remainder of these pieces go on to explore the roles of opposing sonorities, fourths, and sixths, while their most famous example focuses on composed arpeggios. Though nearly dedicated to François Couperin, this set of works was actually inscribed to Chopin, and they experienced a resurgence in popularity similar to their composer's twenty-four preludes. For 10 points, identify this series of twelve didactic piano pieces by the French composer of La Mer.

A well-known algorithm that performs this task, which is not branching, uses two structures informally known as “jump tables”, the first of which is not used in a modification of that algorithm partially named for Horspool. A trie (“try”) with suffix-tree-like links between its nodes is constructed by another algorithm to perform this task; that algorithm is the Aho-Corasick algorithm. This operation, performed by the aforementioned backwards- working Boyer-Moore algorithm, is also performed by an algorithm built around a (*) rolling hash, though that algorithm is less efficient than one that includes a “failure function” to avoid checking characters multiple times, the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. For 10 points, name this operation that is performed by the Rabin-Karp algorithm and the Unix utility grep, which in general involves finding an item, often a string.

answer: {Army}-{McCarthy hearings} [accept answers that mention {McCarthy} and the {US Army}]

At one point during this event, one participant opined that “a pixie is a close relative of a fairy.” This event was chronicled in Emile de Antonio's documentary Point of Order. Its direct cause was Robert Stevens' refusal to give preferential treatment to hotel magnate heir David Schine. This event is sometimes partially credited for the rise of ABC, which was the only major network to cover its thirty six days. At one point in this event, Stuart Symington snapped “You're not fooling anyone” at one participant. During this event, Roy Cohn was accused of doctoring photos. The browbeating of youthful attorney Fred Fisher compelled Joseph Welch to ask “Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?” Shortly after this event, one major participant was condemned within the Senate.

answer: Battle of {Tippecanoe}

After this battle, an Ohio newspaper inaccurately claimed the winning force had lost, while other newspapers spent more time mourning the death of noted Kentucky lawyer Joseph Daveiss than the outcome. A month after this battle, the losing side was encouraged by the New Madrid Earthquake, interpreted as a good omen by one of their leaders. The losing commander blamed the loss on his menstruating wife interfering with his (*) magical powers. This battle was a victory for the “Yellow Jacket” force. The two commanders would later fight again in a battle in Upper Canada, which saw Richard Johnson kill the losing commander's brother. This battle took place at Prophetstown, the home of the Shawnee mystic Tenskwatawa. For 10 points, name this 1811 loss for Tecumseh's forces which gave William Henry Harrison his nickname.

In one of his stories, the craftsman Zi Dima invents a powerful glue, but gets stuck inside while repairing the title container for the litigious Don Lolo Zirafa. Another of his stories ends with the sobbing realization of a man who had rationalized the death of his son after a conversation on a train between parents who had watched their children go to the title conflict. This author of “The Jar” and “War” wrote a novel about a character who serves as a glorified rat catcher after being appointed caretaker of a library.

answer: William {Wordsworth}

This author collaborated with Mary Barker on a poem admonishing Lord Byron to “Halt in thy insane career,” entitled “Lines addressed to a noble lord.” This author's turn towards conservatism caused him to be excoriated in a poem claiming “Just for a handful of silver he left us / Just for a riband to stick in his coat.” This target of Robert Browning's poem “The Lost Leader” was also lampooned in Percy Shelley's poem “Peter Bell the Third.” Along with Robert Southey, he was mocked in the (*) dedication to Don Juan (JOO-on), which satirized the pretentiousness of his long poem The Excursion. He wrote “The very houses seem asleep / And all that mighty heart is lying still” in a poem about his view of London from Westminster Bridge, and described a woman who “sings a melancholy strain” while she “alone...cuts and binds the grain” in “The Solitary Reaper.” For 10 points, name this British Lake poet of The Prelude and “Tintern Abbey.”

In a story related by an ex-priest, this character exhorts a group of men to urinate on a mixture of charcoal, bat guano, and sulfur in order to create gunpowder from a nearby volcano. He asserts that “Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent” to explain his desire to become “suzerain of the earth.” Throughout the novel he appears in, this character claims “If war is not holy man is nothing but antic clay,” and “war is god.” He is last seen in 1878, declaring that he will never die while dancing and playing the fiddle in a saloon, just after he assaults the kid in an outhouse. This enormously tall, hairless character accompanies the (*) Glanton Gang across the Southwest in a novel subtitled “the evening redness in the west.” For 10 points, name this malevolent philosopher of violence in Cormac McCarthy's novel Blood Meridian.

This book's second chapter uses the image of a rocket that explodes noisily before disappearing to describe festivals that seem to produce social regeneration without actually doing so. The fourth chapter of this book argues that forbidden words such as “chingon” and “chingada” reveal that the central group studied in this book believe they are inferior since they are the (*) illegitimate sons of a raped woman. Its first chapter analyzes the clothing worn by the pachuco, and argues that the people it analyzes are “hermetically sealed” and shut themselves inside protective masks.
