answer: "{Notes Toward} a {Supreme Fiction}"

One part of this work contains an angel that forgets "the gold centre, the golden destiny," while another part describes "the President" who has apples on his table and who "ordains the bee to be immortal." Another part of this work describes a war between "the mind and the sky," and that third and final part describes a "mystic marriage in Catawba" between "a great captain and the maid Bawda." It compares a certain task with an Arabian astronomer saying "hoobla hoobla hoobla how." In another section, (*) Nanzia Nunzio confronts Ozymandias, while the final stanza describes how "gladly with proper words the soldier dies." It contains sections like "It must give pleasure" and "it must be abstract” and  attempts to elucidate a concept first established in the first line of its author's “A High-Toned Old Christian Woman”. For 10 points, name this long poem that outlines Wallace Stevens's theories on literature.

answer: {branch prediction} [or if {then else prediction}]

In 2003, Zhijuan Lu et al. developed an “alloyed” form of this task that takes into account both the hybrid form of this task that use multiple table entries for aliasing and the “two-level” form of this technique that makes use of a two-bit shift register. Lucian Vintan was the first person to apply the principles of neural nets to performing this task, which has been implemented on the Itanium architecture. CPUs that implement this technique are susceptible to side channel attacks when using the RSA algorithm while multiplying the large numbers to form the modulus for the public and private keys. Successfully performing this action usually saves on the number of clock cycles because it reduces the number of (*) flushes and stalls in a given datapath. For 10 points, identify this task that commonly involves using a finite state automaton as a saturation counter to determine whether a conditional jump will be taken.

After the unison phrase opening this work's second movement, that movement's principal theme is introduced by the oboe, bassoon, and violas. This symphony's composer was offered one hundred guineas by London Philharmonic Society for exclusive rights to it, an overture, and a vocal piece, a request which so honored that composer that he threw in the Trumpet Overture for free. Its andante con moto second movement, in D minor, opens with a clarinet imitating the chant of a priest and was inspired by a religious procession observed by its composer, while other sections of this piece were inspired by the bawdiness of the (*) Carnival and the ascension of Pope Gregory XVI. Its bright, upbeat first movement is based on a tarantella, while its minor-key final movement contains elements of that dance and of a saltarello. For 10 points, identify this symphony of Felix Mendelssohn, inspired by its composer's visits to cities like Naples.

answer: {convection} [accept either {free convection} or {forced convection} as all {clues} apply {equally} to either]

The usual model of this behavior in the framework of the heat diffusion equation is as a boundary condition of the third kind to in which the outward thermal flux is set equal to a heat transfer coefficient h times the difference between the surface and free-stream temperatures. For buoyancy-driven flows, a widely used method to treat this mechanism is to neglect density variation except where multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity – that method is the (*) Boussinesq approximation. Using the pi theorem on the aforementioned boundary condition, which is Newton's law of cooling, yields the Nusselt number, which scales with the relative strength of this mechanism. For 10 points, name this heat transfer mechanism by which thermal energy is carried away with fluid flow, as distinct from radiation and conduction.

High levels of endogenous salicylic acid are thought to negatively affect the formation of one type of these structures. Organisms in the order Glomales form one type of these associations by penetrating cortical cells, forming structures called arbuscles that degrade to form lipid rich structures simply called "vesicles." When these structures are only found between cortical cells, the resulting network is called a Hartig net, while the covering on the external surface is called a mantle. Their presence is thought to improve heavy metal tolerance in hosts. This (*) association helps the host gain access to minerals in the soil while the symbiont benefits due to the access of carbohydrates from the host. For 10 points, identify these symbiotic associations between fungi and the roots of vascular plants.

One of this thinker's works examines aesthetics from the viewpoint of classicism, romanticism, and didacticism before deciding that a fourth type of “knot” between theory and art must be proposed. This author of the Handbook of Inaesthetics, this thinker has recently released a continuation of his most notable book called The Logic of Worlds. One work by this man defines politics, art, science, and love as the four fields of truth and asserts that one must take “one more step” to counteract the postmodern “end” of philosophy. In his most famous work, this thinker uses Zermelo-Frankel set theory to claim that (*) “mathematics is ontology”, and argues that any work on being must realize that “being qua being” is a “pure multiple”. For ten points, name this speculative realist author of Manifesto for Philosophy, who discussed “generic truth procedures” and “fidelity to the event” in his magnum opus, Being and Event.

Mathias Ullmann, not of condensation fame, developed the decoupled sites representation to calculate characteristic constants for sites on these chemicals when they are considered as non-interacting quasisites. Borkovec and Koper used the Ising model to develop a parameterization to calculate certain microscopic constants associated with these chemicals; those microscopic constants describe the individual equilibria of all species in these chemicals.
