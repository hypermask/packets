answer: {J/psi} meson

Using an effect similar to Debye screening in QED, this particle is thought to be able to be used as a thermometer for a quark-gluon plasma based on its “melting temperature” or dissociation. One theory that solved the kaon to muon rate puzzle and the expected flavor-changing neutral current predicted the constituents of this particle, and is called the GIM mechanism. Much like the Upsilon meson, this particle is often cited for the OZI rule governing the decay of certain particles which involves the annihilation of their constitutents. This particle has a rest mass of 3.096 Giga Electronvolts. It is the second exited state of (*) charmonium and was discovered at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Consisting of a charm quark and an anti-charm quark, for 10 points, name this particle independently discovered by Burton Richter and Samuel Ting, with a two part name.

answer: {Deianira} [accept {Mnesimache} before that name is read]

One story assigns Dexamenus, the son of Oeceus, as this character's father, and tells of how she was briefly forcibly betrothed to Eurytion; however, other versions of that story replace this character with Mnesimache. One of this woman's children volunteered to be sacrificed to Persephone in order to avert war between Eurystheus and Demophon. The fact that she was a daughter of Oeneus and Althaea made her the sister of Meleager. Her future husband defeated the bull-horned river god (*) Achelous in a contest for her hand, and she later became jealous of that husband's interest in Iole, causing her to seek a way to ensure his faithfulness. She acquired a mixture of blood, oil, and semen that would supposedly do just that from her erstwhile captor, the centaur Nessus, but when she spread it on her husband's shirt, it ended up killing him. For 10 points, identify this woman whose name means “man-destroyer”, likely a reference to her accidental killing of her husband Heracles.

answer: {War} in the {Vendée} [accept any {sort} of {conflict} mentioning {Vendee}]

A losing commander in this conflict had to be shot while sitting in an armchair because he was too weak to stand. One incident in this European conflict saw massacres perpetrated by a force called the “infernal columns,” incidents which have caused Reynald Secher to label this conflict a genocide. A key battle in this conflict saw Charles de Bonchamps killed at the Battle of (*) Cholet. It ended after the losing side failed to discover British support at Granville, leading to their defeat at Savenay at the hands of General Lazare Hoche. This conflict was sparked after the Civil Constitution of the Clergy ended up shutting down parish churches, much to the dismay of a certain primarily Catholic populace. For 10 points, name this Royalist counter-rebellion against the French Revolution fought in the namesake region at the mouth of the Loire.

answer: {Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach}

This thinker argued that a being within time and space is the “first sign of the real” in an essay that deries absolute idealism for being the “realized divine mind of Leibnizian theism”. One work by this author of Principles of the Philosophy of the Future claims that the title goal is nothing but pure egotism; that work examines the rise of the “pure naked personhood” that has led to the strong belief in a better life after death. This author of Thoughts on (*) Death and Immortality reversed Hegel in a “transformative method” that states thinking is the product of active individuals. That view was explained in a work that claims that love and faith are contradictory and argues God is divine because he is given ideal human qualities. For 10 points, name this author whose conception of “sensuous activity” was criticized in some theses by Marx and who argued that God is “an [egoistic] outward projection of human nature” in The Essence of Christianity.

answer: {Iguanodon} bernissartensis

One former member of this genus, the species seelyi, was later reclassified in the genus Dollodon, while another former member, the species atherfieldensis, is now recognized as a creature named for this creature's discoverer. Its current neotype, the species bernissartensis, got its name from the coal mines in Bernissart, Belgium, that contained many complete specimens of it. The Te Papa museum in New Zealand is home to the first discovered fossil of this creature, a clearly herbivorous tooth recovered from a limestone quarry in Sussex. David Norman discovered that the ossified tendons in its tail made the quadrupedal and tripodal positions assigned to it by Richard Owen physically impossible, while its most notable physical feature, a large (*) thumb spike, was originally placed on its nose by its discoverer, Gideon Mantell. It was the second dinosaur to be formally named, after Megalosaurus. For 10 points, identify this dinosaur named for the resemblance of its teeth to those of a certain lizard.

answer: {Ludwig van Beethoven's string quartets} [prompt on partial answer]

A seven-movement example of this type of work by this composer ends with a Picardy third after touching on six distinct key areas. The finale of that example of these works unusually quotes directly from the fugue in its first movement, which Richard Wagner called “the most melancholy sentiment ever expressed in music”. They include the six collected in their composer's Opus 18, as well as a more experimental one referred to as “Serioso”. The final movement of the last of these is labeled “The Difficult Resolution” and contains the score markings (*) “Must it be? It must be!” Another of these works features alternating pizzicato sections in the first movement, giving it the nickname “Harp”, while the fourteenth of them prompted Schubert to ask “After this, what is left for us to write?” The ninth one, as well as two which each include a “thème russe”, were written for Count Andreas Rasumovsky. For 10 points, identify these compositions for a certain ensemble that also include the Grosse Fuge, created by the composer of the Eroica symphony.

answer: {Blood clotting} or {coagulation}

One protein near the start of this pathway is activated when its N-terminal domain is cleaved to make a SFLLRN sequence terminal. That sequence then acts as a tethered ligand, initiating trans-membrane signalling, and is found in PAR1. This process can also be initiated by the activation of kallikrein, which itself leads to the cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen. One step in this process is mediated by a glycoprotein stored in ?-granules and involves the adhesion of specialized cell fragments to (*) collagen, and a family of drugs targeting this pathway are based on coumarin. One type of cells involved in this process release calcium ions and thromboxane A2 which helps recruit more cells that participate in this process.  For 10 points, name this process which results in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and subsequent network formation of an impermeable structure which notably includes platelets.
