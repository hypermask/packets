answer: Nathan Bedford {Forrest}

Near the end of this man's life, after his railroad ventures bombed, he ran a prison work farm on President's Island in the Mississippi River. This man's namesake great-grandson was the first American general to be killed in action during the European phase of World War II.  One of this man's greatest victories saw him defeat Samuel Sturgis' much larger force during the Battle of Brice's Crossroads. Near the end of the war he is most associated with, he was unable to stop Wilson's Raid into Alabama. He disgustedly asked “What does he fight battles for?” after disagreeing with Braxton Bragg after the Battle of Chickamauga. This man is frequently linked to the phrase (*) “get there firstest with the mostest,” reflecting his views on mobile warfare. His most notorious action was ordering the massacre of black troops who had apparently surrendered after the Battle of Fort Pillow.

answer: James Ingram {Merrill}

In one of this author's final works, the titular piece of clothing creates a “world map” that calls to mind “Dead white males in malls. / Prayer breakfasts. Pay-phone sex”; that poem is called “Self Portrait in Tyvek Windbreaker”. In another poem he describes putting together a jigsaw puzzle with his Alsatian governess, who he refers to as “Madamoiselle”. In that poem, this author also describes how “the owlet umlaut peeps and hoots / Above the open vowel” while “ransacking Athens” and attempting to recall Rainer Maria Rilke's version of the Paul Valery poem “Palme”. The first section of his best-known work begins with the pun, “Admittedly I err by undertaking / This in its present form”, and that work goes on to envision W. H. Auden dictating his poems in the underworld and has a first part titled “The Book of (*) Ephraim”. That most famous work was inspired by his partner, David Jackson, operating a Ouija board.  For 10 points, name this author of “Lost in Translation” and “The Changing Light at Sandover”.

answer: {Kondo} effect

Eigler used an ellipse of cobalt atoms with an atom at one focus in an experiment that observed the resonance associated with this phenomenon at both foci. For this effect to occur with the presence of large spin atoms, the magnetic anisotropy must produce degenerate ground state levels accompanied by a spin flip in the large atom, and it arises in host materials with magnetic (*) impurities as the conduction electrons are scattered and screen the impurity. It sees the formation of a many-body ground state and involves a log-T contribution to resitivity at low temperatures. For 10 points, identify this effect which was first observed with the divergence of the resistance of at temperatures close to the absolute zero, and is named for a Japanese physicist.

answer: {Phenol}-{chloroform extraction}

The Trizol reagent is sometimes used in this procedure, and one reagent in this procedure sometimes has isoamyl alcohol added. A common alternative to this procedure is performed using a silica-gel spin column sold by QIAgen. The products of this procedure are considered pure if the ratio of absorption at 260 nanometers and 280 nanometers is greater than 1.8. Guanidinium thiocyanate is sometimes used as a chaotrope in this procedure, which uses a reagent that is sold in a stabilizer to prevent its conversion to (*) phosgene. It may be preceded by a digestion of the sample with proteinase K. An ethanol precipitation usually follows this procedure. For 10 points, name this method that uses two namesake chemicals to partition nucleic acid from protein in a solution.
