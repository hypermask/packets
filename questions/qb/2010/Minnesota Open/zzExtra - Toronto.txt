answer: The {Master} of {Go} [or {Meijin}]

In an episode near the middle of this novel, its narrator laments the tendency to “quietly collapse” exhibited by an American he meets on a train. Two of its chapters are devoted to a character study of a set of postmortem photographs of a central character, while another chapter examines that character's decision to maintain an extra-long eyebrow hair as a symbol of long life. In a notable passage, its narrator laments the flight of beauty, opining that “everything had become science and regulation”. This so-called “chronicle-novel”, narrated by (*) Uragami, sees its pivotal action compared to “smearing ink over a picture”. That action is an unexpected and unartistic sealed move that gives Otake time to think. For 10 points, identify this novel that depicts the defeat of Honinbo Shusai in a “retirement game”, a work of Yasunari Kawabata.

That work also claims that while pleasure is universal, the title quality is subjective, not an intrinsic quality of an object.  In another book, this man rejects democracy in favor of a “natural aristocracy” in the section about its subject “in society" and asserts that ideals have no meaning if they are not rooted in the (*) natural world. Another section of that work laments this man's loss of his faith and claims that Catholicism's value lies in its mythology. This man argued that idealism is irrelevant, since everything can be doubted, in a work that urges humans to follow the title instinct.

answer: Photosystem {II} [or {PSII}; or {PS2}; or {P680}]

Joliot discovered the four-period oscillations in the synthesis of one product by this complex, and Kok developed the S-state model for that reaction. The site at which that reaction occurs contains a tetranuclear manganese-calcium cluster which transfers electrons to the Tyrosine-161 residue. This complex is almost always absent in heterocysts since its function is incompatible with nitrogen fixation. At its reaction center, this complex sees the transfer of a particle to (*) plastoquinone, which is shuttled to cytochrome b6f. It sees the splitting of water to release molecular oxygen, and its main role is to convert the energy of photons into excited electrons which are transferred by organic compounds. For 10 points, identify this complex used in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, whose reactions precede those of Photosystem I.

answer: {Sunyaev}-{Zeldovich} effect

The amplitude of this effect scales with the square root of the clumping factor because it is dependent on the concentration of electrons. This effect can be derived from a non-relativistic approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation by assuming a single scattering event, and it has a cot-h-dependence on frequency. The spectral distortion vanishes at the crossover frequency of 218 GHz, though the distortion due to this effect becomes prominent for higher frequencies. For (*) clusters in motion, one can use the kinematic and thermal form of this effect to analyze velocity, and this effect occurs due the presence of hot electrons in intracluster plasmas. For 10 points, identify this effect in which high energy electrons perturb the cosmic microwave background radiation via inverse Compton scattering, named for two Soviet scientists.

answer: {Lithium} [or {Li}]

A superbase that is made by combining equivalents of potassium t-butoxide and a compound containing this metal is called Schlosser's base. Industrial production of this element involves the initial production of its chloride, which is combined with potassium chloride in an equimolar mixture. Models proposed for the action of certain drugs containing this element study the modulation of phosphor-inositol signalling by this element's inhibition of IMPase. Organometallics containing this element are treated with copper (I) (*) iodide to produce Gilman reagents. For fusion reactions, tritium is bred by bombarding the stable isotope of this element with a fast neutron, which produces a tritium atom and a helium atom, and this element is also widely used in drugs that treat bipolar disorder. For 10 points, identify this element, which is the lightest of the alkali metals with atomic number 3.
