answer: Wilhelm Maximilian {Wundt}

Modern views of this man's work are heavily influenced by Edwin Boring's “history” of the discipline that he founded. He believed that sentences were manifestations of the “whole mental processes” of individuals. One of his publications categorized feelings tri-dimensionally, depending on whether they were pleasant or unpleasant, excited or depressed, and tense or relaxed. His historical theory classified man into primitive, totemic, heroic, and present ages. His analysis focused on the process of (*) “apperception,” the study of which defined this man's introspective method. This thinker's student called his approach “Ganzheit” or “holistic.” This author of Folk Psychology also wrote the magnum opus Principles of Physiological Psychology. For 10 points, name this teacher of Edward Titchener, the German father of experimental psychology.

answer: {Boltzmann H}-{theorem}

The “wind-tree” model developed by Ehrenfest was a pedagogical tool used to illustrate this theorem. This theorem assumes that the velocity of molecules in a system are uncorrelated, which is called Stosszahlansatz. The namesake function of this theorem is the integral over the velocity-space of the probability of the state times the natural log of the probability with respect to volume. One criticism of this theorem suggested that a system that has evolved from a non steady-state to a steady-state would (*) retrace its path back to the original state; that criticism was proposed by Loschmidt. For 10 points, identify this theorem from statistical mechanics, supplements the second law of thermodynamics and says that the time derivative for the entropy of an irreversible process has a lower bound of zero.

The villain of this film is served by the effeminate Leonard and is named Phillip Vandamm.

answer: {V}({D}){J Recombination} [accept {VJ Recombination} or {somatic recombination}]

The ARTEMIS protein is involved in the nicking of hairpin loops during this process. P-nucleotides are palindromic segments which may be added during this process, while the addition of N-nucleotides by TdT enhances the outcome of this process. Segments which undergo this process have highly conserved heptamer/nonamer motifs separated by 12 or 23 base pair spacer sequences, and RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins perform this process. This process occurs via the formation of double (*) stranded breaks that are repaired by non-homologous end joining, and its products are found in the light and heavy chains of certain structures. For 10 points, identify this process in which the variable, diverse, and joining gene segments are randomly rearranged, helping generate the variety of T-cell receptors and antibodies needed to combat foreign antigens.

The Homeric Hymn to this figure describes how he and a foe both encounter a man tilling his fields on the grassy plain of Onchestus. He fathered the founder of Cydonia with Minos's daughter Acacallis, while his dalliance with a naiad often thought to be equivalent to Muta or Tacita made him the father of the Lares. This figure, who changed the Minyades into bats, was forced to kill Hierax with a stone in one story. Envy's poison once caused Aglaurus to occupy a threshhold in an attempt to prevent this figure from marrying Herse. Another of his adventures saw him thwart (*) Circe's magic by giving the herb moly to Odysseus. This killer of Argus Panoptes was also the father of the master thief Autolycus. He was born on Mount Cyllene, where one day later he invented the lyre. For 10 points, name this son of Maia who wore a winged hat and winged sandals in his role as messenger of the Greek gods.

One notable participant in this event was shot in the groin and required surgery, which caused him to develop an addiction to morphine. A symbol of this event was the “Blood flag” purportedly soaked with the blood of Andreas Bauriedl. Historian Joachim Fest wrote of one figure “clad in the invincible armour of his arrogance” as he walked straight at a firing line of provincial policemen.

answer: {Simmons}-{Smith} reaction

The Furkawa procedure is one method of obtaining a reagent used in this reaction, though the Emschwiller method of obtaining that reagent is more commonly used. Wittig's modification of this reaction uses diazomethane to generate the namesake reagent, and if the receiving molecule of this reaction has a hydroxyl group in the allylic position, the new functional group is added in the same plane as the OH group. It does not see the formation of a full carbene, and it involves the cis addition of a certain functional group to the less (*) hindered face of a molecule. An activated copper is used to produce the iodo-methyl zinc iodide used in this reaction which adds onto the alkene in a stereospecific manner. For 10 points, identify this doubly eponymous reaction which sees the conversion of an alkene into a cyclopropane, undoubtedly the most important organo-zinc based reaction.

This figure became known as (*) “Jerub-Baal” after he destroyed an altar to Baal. The father of Abimelech, this man used gold taken from his plunder to construct an ephod worshiped by Israelites. He had earlier requested a sign from God by “putting out a fleece.” For10 points, name this Biblical judge who confused and defeated the Midianites with the use of trumpets.

This thinker included three aphorisms about Ni-en in a work that discusses the “grand method”, the “grand order”, and the “grand production”. This author of Me-Ti: The Book of Changes also penned the Messingkauf Dialogues, which he later condensed into his A Short Organum. He sought to replace the duality of form and content with the triad of material, technique, and function, a method he called “refunctioning”. He emphasized the role of decision in his works by use of a technique he called “fixing the “Not/But” element” and sought to provoke a response he termed (*) “complex seeing”, while he was inspired by Victor Shklovsky's concept of “defamiliarization” to create his own conception of the “distancing effect”. For 10 points, identify this dramaturgical theorist whose concepts of “Non-Aristotelian drama” and “epic theater” were enacted in such plays as The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui and Mother Courage and Her Children.

answer: An {Enquiry} Concerning Human Understanding

In its last section, this work attacks Pyrronian skepticism for being too broad and advocates replacing it with an “academic” skepticism limited to matters of fact and abstract concepts. This work uses examples from epic poetry to explain the three form of association. It claims that both external observation and internal reflection are necessary in order to understand causal relationships. In its second chapter, this work argues that experienced “impressions” are always more complete than (*) “ideas” of thought. This book argues that Christianity is better when founded on faith in a section that denies the existence of the namesake religious phenomena because they contradict the laws of nature. The only objection to the “copy principle” appears in a thought experiment that claims that a man can always conceive of a certain color without ever experiencing it. For 10 points, name this expansion of A Treatise of Human Nature that contains “Of Miracles” and an account of the “missing shade of blue”, a book by David Hume.

answer: {covariance} [prompt on “{variance}” until mentioned]

If no transmission bias is assumed in the Price equation, character value changes due to differential productivity are given by this function of character value and fitness. Dispersion matrices contain these quantities, and in the capital asset pricing model, the constant of proportionality between the rate of return on an asset and the rate of return on the market is equal to a ratio of this quantity for the asset and the market and this quantity for the market. For two (*) random variables X and Y, it  is defined as the expected value of X times Y minus the product of the expected value of X and the expected value of Y. For 10 points, identify this quantity whose normalized form is the correlation of two random variables, and when calculated for a random variable with itself gives the variance of that variable.
