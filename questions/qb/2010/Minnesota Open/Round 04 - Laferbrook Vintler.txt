answer: {Seascape}

Late in this work, one character screams “DESCARTES!! DESCARTES!! I THINK: THEREFORE, I AM!!” Earlier, that character describes how, as a child, he would sink to the bottom of a cove near his family's summer house while holding a stone in each hand. Another character in this play repeats the line “Such noise they make!” each of the four times a jet passes by overhead. Act I of this play ends with those two characters rolling onto their backs as one tells the other to “smile! And mean it!” The end of its second and final act sees those characters explain the process of (*) evolution, as one of them describes life with the phrase “mutate or perish”, to this play's two other characters. It opens with Nancy and Charlie finishing a picnic lunch, and its first act ends with the arrival of Leslie and Sarah, who are a pair of giant humanoid lizards. For 10 points, identify this Edward Albee play, which takes its title from the fact that it is set on a beach.

This individual was depicted with folded hands and a green cravat in a painting Norbert Goeneutte. This individual's house was depicted behind a straight tree growing at the point where a dirt road bends, while his garden inspired a painting which shows spiked plants on the right hand side in front of a twisting cypress.

answer: {quantum algorithms} [“{algorithms}” is not {necessary} after it is {said}]

One technique used when implementing these include one where an oracle function is used to partition a space into “good” and “bad” subspaces, known as amplitude amplification. Examples of these that are used to solve elemental distinctness problems and to find triangles in a graph utilize random walks that are defined by operators called coin and shift. The earliest ones were used to solve so-called (*) black box problems, while the most well-known of these reduces one problem to a period-finding problem and then uses a Fourier transform to find that period using Hadamard gates. In addition to one named for Deutsch and Josza, they include two well-known examples that are used to search an unsorted database and to allow for efficient factorization of large numbers, which can be used to break RSA encryption. For 10 points, name this type of algorithm, examples of which are named for Grover and Shor, which are performed on computers built out of qubits.

answer: Robert {Moses}

Ole Singstad bitterly quarreled with this man, claiming he tried to sabotage Singstad's most notable projects. One work about this man featured a chapter called “One Mile,” describing this man's effects on the East Tremont community. This subject of the book Builder for Democracy was the focus of a controversial work by the author of (*) The Years of Lyndon Johnson. He received much of his power from Vincent Impellitteri and William O'Dwyer, who gave him free reign to implement plans promoting cars as the “lungs of the city.” His policies caused him to clash with Walter O'Malley about where to place an athletic stadium. A noted biography of this man is Robert Caro's The Power Broker. His policies were critiqued for destroying mixed-use urban neighborhoods in The Death and Life of Great American Cities. For 10 points, name this master planner of New York City, a nemesis of Jane Jacobs.

answer: {absorption}

The curve of growth measures the strength of this phenomenon as a function of column density, asymptoting to a square root dependence at high column densities as the Lorentzian wings of a given profile begin to dominate.  A simple measure of this phenomenon's strength is the line equivalent width.  This process's namesake coefficient can be expressed in terms of the Einstein B coefficients or as the density times the (*) opacity, and is added to the scattering coefficient to give the extinction coefficient.  For 10 points, name this process whose strength is typically expressed with a negative correction for the effects of stimulated emission, the transfer of energy out of a beam of light and into the material through which the light passes.

Crocco's theorem relates this quantity to the temperature and velocity fields and to the streamline-normal gradients of the entropy and the stagnation enthalpy.  Lamb surfaces are everywhere tangent to this quantity and the velocity.  In the analogy between ideal MHD and incompressible fluid dynamics this quantity is paired with the magnetic field, in part because it is solenoidal.  The volume integral of this quantity's dot product with the velocity equals the (*) helicity, and in general this quantity equals the curl of the velocity.  For 10 points, name this quantity that vanishes in irrotational flow and whose line integral equals the circulation.

This surname is held by a scientist who, along with Augustus Oemler Jr., discovered that the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters increases with redshift. One historical figure with this nickname is rumored to have written the phrase "No Quarter" on the back of a playing card, the nine of diamonds, leading to a certain curse. That man surrendered at the Convention of Kloster-Zeven after winning his most famous victory, for which he became the dedicatee of Handel's oratorio Judas Maccabaeus.
