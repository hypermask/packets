This character dubs someone “an old plant left over from the Edwardian wilderness.” As a young man, he saw his father die after being injured in the Spanish Civil War. He had an old friend named Hugh, who abandoned this character to go write a novel in China. In the first act, he calls another character “Lady Pusillanimous,” and wishes that she would have a child only to watch it die. In the final act, he improvises a routine called “T.S. Eliot and Pam” with his friend (*) Cliff. During the play in which he appears, he frequently reads the papers and plays his jazz trumpet, although he is last seen playing the game of “Bears and Squirrels” with his wife. This sweet stall operator has an affair with Helena Charles, the friend of his wife Alison. For 10 points, name this John Osborne created character, the protagonist of Look Back in Anger.

answer: The {Pentose Phosphate} pathway [or {Pentose Phosphate shunt}; accept the {phosphogluconate pathway} or the {hexose monophosphate shunt}]

Chronic Granulomatous Disease can be a result of a mutation that causes a deficiency of the rate limiting enzyme for this pathway; that enzyme catalyzes the conversion of a reactant into a lactone. It is performed in the cytosol and is heavily used by red blood cells to produce a molecule important to the production of reduced glutathione. The primary product of the (*) oxidative phase of this pathway generates cofactors that help deal with oxidative stress, while its non-oxidative phase sees the production of a compound that is recruited in the synthesis of nucleic acids, and the interconversion of that molecule into 3 and 7 carbon molecules. For 10 points, identify this pathway which produces NADPH and a member of its namesake family of molecules, ribose-5-phosphate.

At the premiere of one of this composer's pieces, Saint-Saens, the pianist, refused to wait for applause because he disliked the frequent modulations. The Mass for three voices by this composer of a Piano Quintet in F Minor contains the best-known setting of Thomas Aquinas's hymn Panis Angelicus. The opening of one of his better-known works is often compared to Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto; that work was dedicated to Louis Diémer and is called Symphonic Variations. The Count sounds his (*) hunting horn against the backdrop of church bells and chants in a symphonic poem composed by this man called Le Chasseur Maudit. He also composed a three-movement work whose second movement features a poorly-received section in which the English horn plays a melody over the plucked harp and strings. For 10 points, name this Belgian organist whose only symphony was 1888's Symphony in D Minor.

answer: {turbulence} [or {turbulent} flow]

This behavior can be modeled by solving the Burgers equation with random forcing, but more commonly modeled with the standard k-epsilon model.  The two-dimensional type of this phenomenon features an upscale energy cascade, a reversal of a concept originally proposed by Richardson.  Intermittency in this phenomenon is manifested in anomalous scaling of the velocity structure functions of order p. Those functions were predicted to scale as the mean energy dissipation to the one-third p in a paper by (*) Kolmogorov, who also posited that this regime contains an “inertial range” of length scales lying above his namesake dissipation scale, at which viscous effects become significant.  Characterized by enstrophy production and vortex stretching, for 10 points, name this regime of fluid flow that occurs at high Reynolds number, the counterpart of laminar flow.

One ritual dedicated to this non-Christian deity involved priests or midwifes greeting her as they sprinkled newborns with drops of water before naming them. This deity is often depicted carrying a cross representing the four winds. In one story, this deity was accused of not truly loving humanity, which caused her to cry blood for over fifty years, resulting in a flood that ended the age of the fourth sun. This goddess was usually depicted as a river from which grew a (*) prickly pear tree, the fruit of which symbolized the human heart.

Another of his works tells of a child from the poor district who, looking like “some wee battler in a war”, steals a toy fire truck from a prettier child.

Michael Ariens' article “A Thrice-Told Tale, or Felix the Cat” accused Felix Frankfurter of fabricating a document related to this case. In Scalia's dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, he contrasted this non-abortion related case with Dred Scott v. Sandford. The minority opinion in this case cited the Court's previous ruling in Morehead v. New York as proper. The decision in this case was notably delayed because of Harlan Stone's dysentery. The majority opinion is best known for stating “The (*) Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract.” This case overturned Adkins v. Children's Hospital by upholding Washington's minimum wage law.

Isatin forms complexes with copper (II) containing this functional group that have been shown to interact with the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In glycolysis, there is an intermediate of this type in the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase catalyzed reaction.  A Mannich base undergoing hydrolysis yields a compound with this functional group. In Vitamin B6, the aldehyde group of the PLP cofactor attacks an (*) amino group to produce an intermediate with this functionality. They can be produced by the reaction of alkenes with hydrazoic acid via the Schmidt reaction, and in the aza Diels-Alder reaction, one of these reacts with a diene to form a tetra-hydro-pyri-dine. For 10 points name this functional group characterized by a nitrogen carbon double bond that is used as an electron sink in many reactions.

One section of this work laments that current society “pinches” men in a section claims that Europe could soon resemble the homogeneous China. That chapter of this work also encourages eccentric experimentation and “self-creation” that allows genius to thrive. The first chapter of this work excuses the tyrannical dictatorship of Akbar the Great because he ruled over barbarians incapable of (*) sovereignty. This book's fourth chapter uses the banning pork in Muslim societies as an example of an objectionable law since it restricts innocuous choices and violates this work's most significant rule. That principle argues that the right to think, assemble, and pursue interests can only breach the rights of others to prevent the physical or mental damage of others. For 10 points, name this work that articulated the harm principle and rails against the tyranny of the majority, an examination of civil freedom by John Stuart Mill.

One study of this group of people posited that the “principle of disregard for outer form while retaining inner values” is the most important factor for understanding how westerners view their native social systems. Franz Boas attacked Robert B. Bean's research on this group's brain size in the last chapter of The Mind of Primitive Man, arguing that this group's “problem” did not exist. One tome that takes this group as its subject posits that changes in their perception would result from the (*) “principle of cumulation,” which would eventually conform to the “American Creed.” Another book argues that this group lives behind a “veil” that produces a “double-consciousness” of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others.

The average radiation strength in this entity is often expressed as a multiple of the Habing field.  In it, Stromgren spheres are formed around sources of ionizing radiation.  The MRN distribution predicts that one type of matter here is distributed as radius to the -3.5.  A peak at 2175 angstroms in its extinction curve has been attributed to the presence of silicates and amorphous carbon, while its emission spectrum features bands in the infrared due to (*) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  Radiation intensity here plummets for wavelengths below the Lyman edge.  Observations of pulsar dispersion and the 21 centimeter line are used to trace the presence of ionized and neutral gas in it.  At the heliopause, its pressure is balanced by that of the solar wind.  For 10 points, name this mixture of rarefied gas and dust that fills the space between stars.
