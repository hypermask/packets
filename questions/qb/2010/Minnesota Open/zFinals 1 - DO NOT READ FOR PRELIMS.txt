One of this man's recurring characters was introduced in his first novel, The Cotton-Pickers and later appeared a third time in The Bridge in the Jungle. That character made his most famous appearance in a novel by this man in which he is shanghaied into serving on the Empress of Madagascar after earlier being stranded in Antwerp and forced to take a job as a drag man aboard the Yorikke. The most famous novel by this creator of Gerald Gales and author of The Death Ship stars the prospectors Curtin, Howard, and Fred C. (*) Dobbs, the latter two of whom are eventually caught and executed by the Federales. The 1948 John Huston adaptation of that novel by this man popularized a line he'd originally written as “In fact, we don't need badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges!” He may be synonymous with his ostensible agent Hal Croves, while others think his true identity is Otto Feige or Ret Marut. For 10 points, identify this mysterious author of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

answer: {leptin}

This compound activates the synthesis of FAAH, which degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide. This hormone upregulates the synthesis of melanocortins, and female mice administered with this protein have been shown to undergo puberty at an earlier age, indicating its possible role in fertility. This hormone targets the expression of neuropeptide Y in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and (*) ghrelin counteracts the effects of this hormone. Parabiosis experiments on mice conducted by Coleman significantly improved the understanding of this hormone, since Ob [Oh-bee] mutant mice showed no effect, while normal mice underwent significant weight-loss. It is primarily secreted by adipocytes, and low levels of this hormone may be found in obese people. For 10 points, identify this hormone which plays an important role in the metabolism of fat and whose levels signal satiety.

answer: Alexander {Ypsilantis} [or {Ypsilanti}]

This man's drooping eyelids and frontal baldness may reflect the myotonic dystrophy that ravaged his family. He lost his right arm while fighting against Napoleon at the Battle of Dresden. This man's namesake father set up a civil court system while serving as prince of Wallachia during the 1770's. In 1821, this man crossed the Pruth River and then issued a call to arms at Iasi, where he claimed to have the support of a great power. His last days were spent in poverty and confinement in Austrian territory where he had fled to after his forces were defeated at the battle of (*) Dragasani. He previously served as an aide-de-camp to Alexander I, who refused to support his most notable venture. This leader of the modern day Sacred Band brigade became leader of the nationalist group Filiki Eteria after it was turned down by Russian foreign minister John Capodistria.

One of these figures was once ambushed while bathing in the Puchai River, but was able to defend himself with a Greek hat. That figure later becomes stuck in the pools of blood left over from a three-day-long duel, but he uses a magic incantation and his spear to clear the blood away, allowing him to rescue Zabava. Another of these figures won a duel by praying for rain, which soaked the paper wings of his opponent, the dragon Tugarin. The best-known of these characters, who was unable to walk until age 33, defeated a wind demon known as (*) Nightingale the Robber while riding through the Black Mire and was given strength by the giant knight Sviatogor.

This novel's narrator vows to avoid dying like the submarine commander Tsutomu Sakuma, whose final diary entry he misquotes. The location on which most of this novel takes place is revealed to its main character by an Italian rug-seller in Calcutta named Dalmacio Ombrellieri. On arriving at an aquarium, its protagonist is shocked to encounter dead fish identical to those he'd previously seen, and shortly thereafter is confused to see two suns and two moons in the sky. The narrator quickly falls in love with a woman who enjoys watching sunsets named (*) Faustine. Its narrator is a fugitive from Caracas who washes up on what he believes to be the island of Villings, after which he encounters a dozen people who repeatedly reenact the same two weeks and who are later revealed to be recordings projected by the title machine.

answer: the {uncanny} [or {unheimlich}]

One writer claimed that this concept is an “experience of [the] limits” of nature in an essay that distinguishes this concept from the marvelous and events not controlled by natural laws. This concept was first introduced in a work that claims that bright children are more fearful since they are aware of the limits of their knowledge and also argues this phenomenon arises from “intellectual uncertainty” about one's usual environment. It was described in Tzvetan Todorov's "The Fantastic" and in an essay by Ernst Jentsch, the latter of which formed the basis of another essay about this concept that claims that the fear of blinding in E.T.A. Hoffman's “The Sandman” represented a fear of (*) castration. That essay claims that this concept is the return of repressed infantile fears and traces the linguistic origins of this concept from the German word for “unhomely”. This concept is also explained as the unease when confronted with a look-alike or a severed hand. For 10 points, name this concept, the subject of an essay by Freud about the “uncomfortably strange”, which names a “valley” that describes the reaction to robots that look too human.

answer: {nucleation} [or {nucleate transition}]

The Zeldovich equation gives the kinetics of an early stage of this process. Heat flux dramatically decreases during liquid-vapor transitions when the heat transfer mechanism changes from this type of boiling to film boiling. The heterogeneous form of this process usually occurs at grain boundaries and is faster than the homogenous form at similar conditions, and this process is usually divided into four regimes, the first of which is called incubation. This process usually occurs after the free energy for the formation of new volume reaches its maximum, and this process sees the creation of tiny spherical particles that propagate to grow larger particles. For 10 points, identify this process which is exemplified by the formation of bubbles in soda and is the basis for cloud seeding.

Archaeologist Gary Chafetz was arrested for smuggling an airplane into a country during his search for a relic associated with this ruler. One key victory of this man was brought about when Phanes of Halicarnassus defected to his side. Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni recently claimed to have found this man's lost army, which was swallowed up by a sandstorm while off to destroy the Oracle of Amun. At the time of his death, he was dueling against either his brother or a Magian priest posing as his brother. This brother of Bardiya was said to have developed madness after slaying the (*) Apis Bull. His most notable military victory was his defeat of Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium, which brought Egypt under the control of his empire. Traditional accounts claim he died from gangrene brought on when he accidentally stabbed himself. For 10 points, name this Persian son and successor to Cyrus the Great.

Konstantin Sergeyev stole an adagio from Pugni and Perrot's ballet La Esmeralda to create an third pas de deux for Act One, Scene Two of this ballet in which the title character is wrapped in a veil and dances with an unnamed slave. This ballet was modified again by Nikolai Zubkovsky, who added a 5/4 "Marche persane" from Le Papillon to create the Dance of the Golden Idol variation. The title character of this ballet attempts to stab the daughter of the Raja since that daughter, Gamzatti, is betrothed to her lover, Solor. Gamzatti later kills that title character of this ballet with a poisonous snake hidden in a basket of flowers. In sadness Solor smokes opium and dreams of the (*) Kingdom of the Shades, a small, plotless pas classique that contains this ballet's second pas de deux between Solor and his dead lover, Nikiya. For 10 points, name this ballet about the title Indian temple dancer that was composed by Ludwig Minkus and choreographed by Marius Petipa.

This man's involvement in real estate deals saw him build the sixteen-story Unity Building. He eventually died of a cerebral hemorrhage while making a speech on behalf of the Boers. His last political campaign saw him run for mayor on the Municipal Union Party. This man ‘s book Our Penal Machinery and its Victims was cited as legal inspiration by one of his protégés, Clarence Darrow. His election as governor ended a 40-year string of Republican control of his state, although he would break with (*) Grover Cleveland by endorsing free silver and Progressive policies in 1896.  During his administration, he was bitterly opposed to Richard Olney's decision to send federal troops into his state during a labor dispute. For 10 points, name this governor of Illinois during the Pullman strike, who also pardoned the Haymarket Square convicts.

A commodity-indexed form of this quantity is multiplied by factor productivity to obtain the “single factorial” form of this quantity, and was developed by Jacob Viner. According the Herberger-Laursen-Metzler hypothesis, a decrease in this quantity directly leads to a decrease in savings rate. Singer and Prebisch invoked low income-elasticity of demand to hypothesize that in the long run, this quantity declines for primary products and natural resources, prompting many countries to adopt (*) ISI policies. A “small open economy” is one which is unable to shift this quantity even with changes in its offer curve, and in the 2-factor, 2-country, 2-goods neoclassical framework, it is calculated as the slope of the line connecting the origin to the intersection of offer curves. For 10 points, identify this quantity which describes the prices at which imported and exported goods are exchanged.

answer: {Perovskite}

The Ruddlesden-Popper phases are one form of these minerals composed of strontium silicate and strontium oxide. These minerals have 8 vertex sharing BX6 octahedra and AX12 cuboctahedra, with the A atoms occupying corners, the B atoms occupying the body centers, and the anions at face centers. Alternating layers of distorted tetrahedral and tilted octahedral characterize the structure of the “oxygen deficient” varieties of these minerals, examples of which include brownmillerite. Many high (*) temperature superconductors are minerals of this type consisting of copper-oxide layers, and a layer of magnesium silicate at the core mantle boundary is thought to exist in the “post” form of these minerals. Examples of these minerals include  For 10 points, identify this family of minerals whose first discovered member was calcium titanate, and are named for some Russian mineralogist.

answer: “{Tam o}' {Shanter}”

The ante-penultimate stanza of this poem notes how “eager runs the market-crowd / when “Catch the thief!” resounds aloud”. Earlier, it claims that “pleasures are like poppies spread, / you seize the flower, its bloom is shed” and asserts that “No man can tether Time nor Tide”. This poem's speaker exclaims “Inspiring bold John Barleycorn! What dangers thou canst make us scorn!” in an ironic paean to (*) whiskey, which is appropriate as its title character ignored his wife Kate's advice not to get drunk. It ends with the horse Meg losing its tail to Maggie as its title figure flees over the river Doon, which was prompted by his shouting “Weel done, Cutty-sark!” at a group of witches dancing on Alloway Kirk. For 10 points, identify this Robert Burns poem whose titular protagonist lends his name to a type of Scots hat.

answer: the Battle of {Nagashino}

The site at which this battle took place was originally the home of the Suganuma family. Eight of the Nijushi-sho, or Twenty-Four Generals, were killed at this battle, which saw the defending forces set up behind a stream known as the Rengogawa. Fearing a repeat of the events of Mikatagahara, one side's commander built a series of zigzagging wooden stockades and deployed his (*) arquebusiers behind them. That strategy proved successful, thwarting the cavalry charges of the attackers and relieving the besieged forces of Okudaira Sadamasa. For 10 points, identify this 1575 battle in which the combined forces of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated the army of Takeda Katsuyori.
