answer: {Hundred Flowers Campaign/Movement} [accept {Baihua Yundong} or anything with {Baihua}]

The “three-hundred-thousand-character petition” against the “Five Daggers” anticipated much of the rhetoric of this period. One article written during this period was titled “Realism—the Broad Road,” which challenged the earlier conclusions of the Yenan Forum. It followed the three-anti/five-anti campaigns and could be interpreted as an abrupt policy change. This period was the focus of the speech “On the Correct Handling of the (*) Contradictions Among the People.” The Anti-Rightist Campaign was a reaction against the events of this period, during which one leader outlined six criteria for identifying “poisonous weeds.” It arose out of a speech given promoting intellectualism by Zhou Enlai. For 10 points, name this period in the 1950's, during which the Chinese Communist Party temporarily encouraged the spreading of social criticisms much like an earlier period of intellectual diversity.

answer: {North American} Plate

It is bordered on its south by a structure that formed during the Eocene called the Gonave, and its major craton is underlain by the Abitibi greenstone belt. Also subjected to the Grenville and Sevier orogenies, much fault-blocking has taken place on it due to its subduction of the Farallon structure. It includes the Anahim, Jemez, and Raton hotspots, and its surface was covered by the Sundance Sea as well as the Cretaceous Inner Seaway.  The MTJ experiment is being conducted at the northern terminus of another feature found at its western edge. Another feature found on this body contains the world's largest dike swarm, and the southern end of that feature has (*) lobes named Wadena and Rainy as evidence of recent glaciations events. A more notable feature of this geological mass is a large caldera housing a supervolcano that is thought to erupt every 600,000 years. For 10 points identify this geologic mass that includes the Canadian Shield and the Yellowstone Supervolcano, and whose fight with the Pacific Plate causes earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault.

answer: The {Structural Transformation} of the {Public Sphere}

Nancy Fraser accused this work of bracketing off inequalities and assuming the existence of a priori private concerns in her book called Rethinking the subject of this work. One section of this book argues that the literary form of the title subject has been turned into the world of culture consumption. This work contends that as the press became increasingly commercialized, it turned from transmitting (*) debate to shaping it. In the introduction to this work, its author describes the influence of polis-oikos in ancient Greece and capitalism on development of civil society. This work argues that as medieval courts changed into towns, coffee houses and salons became the center of the title area of civic debate. For 10 points, name this book expanded upon in The Theory of Communicative Action, the first major work of Jurgen Habermas.

The Kroger-Vink notation incorporates the change in charge to describe these structures, and the Howie-Whelan equations need to be modified with an exponential of g dot R in order to describe these structures. A Dutch physicist lends his name to a vector which describes the shear produced by one type of these. In addition to types which are described by the Burgers vector, another type of these that obey the conservation of charge come in (*) Schottky and Frenkel varieties, the latter of which sees the migration of an ion to an interstitial. They include interstitial self-atoms, interstitial impurities, self impurities, or vacancies, and they come in stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric varieties. Higher dimensional examples of them include precipitates, stacking faults, and dislocations. For 10 points, identify these locations where the appropriate atoms are misplaced.

Two characters in this novel bond over having previously had a crush on the same daughter of a Dutch tile-factory owner, whose daughter they save from the ruins of that factory. One of those characters later punches a priest in preparation for joining the Atheist Club and unearths 100 coffins, 98 of which are carried off by Yelisey, who later carries a character who repeats “Bring me my mother's bones”. The most colorful character in this novel is a bear who, when not serving as a smith, attempts to defecate on a commode and is used for sniffing out kulaks. This novel opens with the conflict between thinking and mindless (*) working, the former of which is espoused by Voshchev, whose existentialism deepens as he sees the peasants and workers constructing the title object, the seat of the House of the Proletariat.

answer: {London} equations

They can be condensed into one equation in a namesake gauge where the Laplacian of Coulomb potential is zero. Applying Ampere's law to one of them and taking the curl of both sides gives an equation that relates the Laplacian of the B-field to a characteristic quantity; that quantity, which scales as the one half power of the (*) supercurrent density, is the distance at which the B field decays to B naught over e. One of them relates the time derivate of the superconducting current to the electric field and the other relates the curl of the current to the magnetic field. The aforementioned characteristic constant is the “penetration depth” given by these equations, which are able to describe the Meissner effect. For 10 points, identify these equations named for two brothers, one of who also lends his name to some dispersion forces.

In such poetry collections as I Heard God Laughing and The Gift, Daniel Ladinsky claimed to be “interpreting” the works of this poet. In one of his poems, he describes the spurning of the mountains and the earth of God's love, which Man foolishly takes up, earning the jealousy of the angels. He wrote of the “blazing lightnings” and “dawn wind” in a poem in which his friends advise him against falling in love. Those poems, subtitled “Time-rise” and “News from Abroad,” do not contain such common themes of this poet as criticism of the hypocrisy of religious leaders. He undertook the Chilla-nashini vigil on the fortieth anniversary of his marriage with Zayn al-Attar, which itself occurred after this man (*) learned the Qu'ran by heart and thus earned his pen-name. He is currently Interred in a frequently-visited tomb in Shiraz. For 10 points, identify this author whose Divan contains many ghazals, the favorite poet of many Iranians.

This man used “correspondance” or “c-rules” and “t-postulates” to build off Frank Ramsay's attempts to make sentences such as “are electrons real?” more empirical in his work Pseudoproblems in Philosophy. Along with Hans Reichenbach, this thinker co-created the Erkenntnis journal of (*) analytic philosophy. He argued against the Wittgenstein's reductive view of language in Logical Syntax of Language, and he claimed that all empirical statements should be grounded in immediate experiences in a foundational work of logical positivism.

This painter depicted a blue and beige-frocked woman holding an astrolabe in his Personification of Astrology. Two ships prepare to leave the shore and a bow-wielding Cupid flies over an unlit funeral pyre in his version of The Death of Dido. He painted a simple man physically pushing away a naked temptress in his version of Joseph and Potiphar's Wife. He isn't Poussin, but he did include a gigantic skull in the bottom right corner of his Et in Arcadia Ego, which joined The Flaying of Marsyas by Apollo in the Palazzo Pitti. He received commissions for The Flagellation of Christ and for the Duomo of Piacenza, both of which were secondary in accomplishment to a work noted for its layered Baroque and Classical styles in the representations of Heaven and Earth. That work was originally for the St. (*) Peter's Basilica, which was fitting, because it depicts the martyrdom of St. Peter's daughter. For 10 points, identify this Italian painter of the Burial of St. Petronilla, nicknamed “the squinter” for being cross-eyed.
