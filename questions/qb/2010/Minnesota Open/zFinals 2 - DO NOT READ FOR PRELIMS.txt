answer: {Wolof} empire [accept {Jolof} or {Djolof}]

Ngoone Sobel led a revolt against this polity and defeated its burbaa at the Battle of Danki in 1549, which led to the establishment of the state of Kajoor. This polity's founder, Njajan Njai, is alleged to have emerged for water to settle disputes between the Waalo people, and united the Waalo, Bawol, and Cayor tribes.

answer: homotopy

A mapping from a total space of a fiber bundle to a paracompact base satisfies the “lifting” property of this type. A homomorphism exists between homology groups and groups with this property, according to Hurewicz's theorem. When inclusion maps of two manifolds into a simply-connected cobordism have this property, the maps are said to have an (*) equivalence relation of this type. All functions in a topological space that contain the same points belong to an equivalence class of this type, and the fundamental group is the simplest group of this type. For 10 points, identify this term which describes two objects which can be continuously transformed into each other.

answer: The {Concept} of {Mind}

Daniel Dennett compared re-reading this work to Pierre Menard's new writing of Don Quixote and claims it is "wonderfully, importantly shallow" in an essay titled "Reintroducing" this work. This work claims that language referring to the self is just public language reversed in the section "The Systematic Elusiveness of I". This book uses the example of a cigarette smoker to distinguish between "episodes" and "dispositions" in a chapter that claims that learning only implies the ability to do things. That chapter also outlines the difference between the capacity to be right and the tendency to act a certain way, or (*) knowing and believing in the section "Knowing How and Knowing That". This work opens by asserting that the "original thesis" of philosophy is nothing more than a "category-mistake" that results from erroneously distinguishing mental processes from their physical origins and from relying on a "ghost in the machine". For 10 points, name this work that attacks Cartesian dualism, a book by Gilbert Ryle.

Latent gene expression in this agent is controlled by promoters called C sub p, Q sub p, and W sub p. Its glycoprotein 350/220 is a major target of antibodies and vaccines being designed to combat this disease. The LMP-1 protein of this agent activates the CD40 pathway, which activate the JNK and p38 associated survival pathways in their targets. They enter their targets by interacting with CR2, and patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome are susceptible to infections by it. The Paul-Bunnell test is a (*) heterophile agglutination test used to detect infections by this agent. Multiple episomal copies of this virus are found in tumors from nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and it may also cause a disease in which a type of cells may have a “starry sky” appearance. For 10 points, name this member of the herpesvirus family that is most commonly transferred through saliva, a DNA virus that causes infectious mononucleosis.

answer: {Pound}-{Rebka} experiment

The results of this experiment have been confirmed by the experiments of Turneaure, who used 1.42 GHz masers and superconducting-cavity stabilized oscillators. That experiment improved upon the Vessot-Levine experiment that confirmed this experiment using a maser fired on a rocket. Further experiments by one of its namesakes and Snider led to more accurate results for this experiment, and it was performed in a tube filled with helium in order to reduce scattering. Central to this experiment were two (*) iron crystals placed 74 feet apart, one of which served as an emitter of 14.4 KeV gamma rays, and the other of which absorbed the gamma ray. This experiment gave a value for gravitational redshift that was close to values predicted by Einstein's theory.

This thinker claimed that the fact that Hobbes and Foucault both spoke of a “war of all against all” leads many to think that they have more in common besides “the fact that, with the exception of Hobbes, both were bald.” One of his texts arose from a debate with Gananath Obeyesekere about the distinction between “Western” and “indigenous” thought, which arose from Obeyesekere's book about a certain figure who was mistaken for Lono. He relied on Richard B. Lee's studies among the !Kung (pronounced “[tongue-click] Kung”) for a symposium about “Man the Hunter” at which he proposed one of his notable theses, which was later expounded on in his Stone Age Economics. This thinker wrote (*) How “Natives” Think about Captain Cook, for Example and posited that hunter-gatherer economies were the “original affluent society.” For 10 points, name this University of Chicago anthropologist.

One modification of this theory assumes the presence of hydrated, tightly bound counterions that cause potential to decay in one region. In that modification, the charge in one region has a hyperbolic sine dependence on namesake potential. This theory, which was improved by Stern, assumes a Poisson-Boltzmann distribution of charges and a uniform dielectric constant in the aqueous phase. The DLVO theory assumes the structure proposed by this model. It describes a rigid, charged (*) surface in contact with a cloud of oppositely charged ions in solution, though its shortcomings include the assumption that activity is equal molar concentration and that ions behave as point charges. It has been successfully used to model phospholipid bilayers and colloidal particles. For 10 points, identify this theory which improved upon the Helmholtz model, which models a diffuse electric double layer.
