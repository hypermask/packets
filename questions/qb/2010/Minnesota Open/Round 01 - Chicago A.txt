Videogames set in this place feature such subtitles as “Living the Adventure” and “The Timestone Pirates”, while Alan Dean Foster penned novels titled for this place “Lost” and for the “Hand of” this place. A recent book introduced a kingdom near this place called Chandara, while its own landmarks include the Rainy Basin, where Lee Crabb attempts to steal a ruby. The namesake “Code” of this place is an acrostic that forms the phrase “SOW GOOD SEED”. The mythology of this location tells of a creature named Ogthar who stole a number of sunstones while the sun was sleeping in the (*) World Beneath, allowing him to create Poseidos, which was later destroyed by the sea. Its human population consists primarily of Dolphinbacks, some of whom go on to serve as riders of the skybax. Arthur and Will Denison arrive here in the first book about this place, which is subtitled “A Land Apart from Time”. For 10 points, identify this fictional island country created by James Gurney, the population of which includes sentient Quetzalcoatlus and Triceratops.

answer: “{Ballad} of {Reading Gaol}”

The speaker of this poem, which was originally published under the name “C.3.3.”, asks “How else but through a broken heart / May Lord Christ enter in?” Its speaker describes how “alien tears” will fill “Pity's long-broken urn” and notes that “outcasts always mourn” in a quatrain from this poem chosen as the epitaph on its author's tomb. Its sixth section describes a “pit of shame” containing a “wretched man / eaten by teeth of flame”. Its speaker earlier watched that man look “so wistfully at the day” while walking “among the (*) Trial Men / in a suit of shabby grey”. Ruminating on that man leads the speaker to consider a certain action, which the coward does “with a kiss” and the brave man does “with a sword”. For 10 points, the idea that “each man kills the thing he loves” is expressed by which poem, written shortly after Oscar Wilde's release from the title prison?

One of these “on the name of Albert Roussel” was composed by Jacques Ibert, while Carlos Chavez composed another one of these works for six percussionists.  Six of these, including two with sections labeled “discurs,” were composed by Juan Cabanilles.  One of these works is titled “Little Train of the Caipira” and concludes Villa-Lobos' Bachianas Brasileiras Number 2.  Other examples include the concluding movement of Ravel's Le (*) Tombeau de Couperin and one composed by Prokofiev opens with a later-recurring theme in which the right and left hands alternately play D. Perhaps the most famous example of this form begins with an unfolding diminished seventh chord which resolves into a D major chord; that piece, beloved by Leopold Stokowski, is the first half of BWV 565. For 10 points, identify this compositional form, paired with a fugue in a D minor work by J.S. Bach.

answer: The {New Science} [or La {Scienza Nuova}]

The first section of this work claims that Descartes' reduction of knowledge to mathematical principles is a form of conceit and argues instead that true knowledge comes from knowing how things are made through human action. That section of this work also distinguishes between certainty, the object of consciousness, and truth, the object of the title study. This book asserts that all societies have a collection of “judgments without reflection” contained in a “mental dictionary” that developed from the poetic language of the giganti, or early humans, that characterized the early (*)  barbaric stages of civilization. The third stage, the age of man, is dominated by the language of reason, which causes so much self-reflection that it drives society back to the first stage, a process this work labels “recurso”. For 10 points, name this work that presents a cyclical theory of history, written by Giambattista Vico.

answer: Treaty of {Karlowitz}

The Sava and the Unna were some of the rivers that formed the new boundaries dictated in this treaty, which saw Poland gain Podolya and southern Ukraine. Venetians gained Dalmatia and the Peloponnesus as a part of this treaty, but those gains were lost in a subsequent treaty negotiated in 1719. One side retained control over an area that was bounded by Danube to the south and the Mures river to the north, though a separate treaty signed in the year following this treaty saw the transfer of (*) Azov to Russia. The side that imposed this treaty had earlier slaughtered 20,000 of Mustafa II's men and forced another 10,000 to drown in the Tisza River at the Battle of Zenta. Signed by Leopold I, it was an outcome of a brilliant victory by Eugene of Savoy.

The dramatic drop in specific heat of atoms at low temperatures can be explained by treating the system as one of these. Describing one of these models with Schrodinger's equation shows the ground state energy of a diatomic molecule is half of Planck's constant times natural frequency, and thus can never be zero. In a classical instance of one of these, the Q factor shows how much energy is lost per cycle in this system, which for a simple one of these is zero. Setting (*) mass times acceleration proportional to displacement gives a differential equation which when solved gives a simple version of this system's position as a function of time. For 10 points, name this model resulting when Newton's second law is set equal to Hooke's Law, the simplest example of which is a frictionless spring.
