Enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, and the coefficient of this quantity are the subjects of the four Lee-Kesler tables. An analogue of Raoult's law that instead invokes this quantity is named for this quantity's originator and Merle Randall. One definition of activity gives it as the ratio of this quantity in the actual to steady state. The chemical potential may be given as Boltzmann's constant times temperature times the natural log of this quantity. This quantity's dimensionless coefficient is the ratio of it to pressure and measures a gas's degree of non-ideality. Introduced by Gilbert Lewis, for 10 points, name this measure of adjusted pressure that gives a substance's tendency to escape a given phase.

answer: {Fermat's last} theorem [prompt on {Fermat's theorem}; do not accept or prompt on "Fermat's little

Ernst Kummer used ideals to prove that this theorem is true for all numbers divisible by regular primes. Sophie Germain divided this theorem into two cases and proved that its first case is true for all primes p such that p plus two is also prime. Because at least one non-modular Frey curve would exist if this theorem were false, this theorem can be proven by demonstrating that all elliptic curves are modular forms. Euler used the method of infinite descent to prove this theorem for the case n equals three, where n is the exponent of the Diophantine equation central to this theorem. For 10 points, name this theorem, that states that, if n is an integer greater than two, there are no distinct positive integers x, y, and z such that x to the n plus y to the n equals z to the n; a theorem eventually proven by Andrew Wiles.

answer: {genetic drift}

The Cavalli-Sforza chord distance method assumes this is the only force at work, and the A-type Extinction Vortex occurs when this force becomes too powerful. For a single locus, the ability of this force to change frequencies is equal to one over two N. The amount of time needed for a new neutral allele to achieve a fixed frequency via this force is equal to four times the population size. In Kimura's neutral theory, this is the major force driving evolution. The founder effect and bottleneck effect are examples of this effect, which is more likely to occur with small population sizes. For 10 points, name this random change in allele frequencies.

answer: the {Pauli} exclusion principle

In the liquid drop model, this idea is responsible for the asymmetry energy. This rule is the reason that, at absolute zero, Fermi gases has greater energy ideal gases. Because its nuclei obey this rule, helium-3 has two superfluid phases rather than one. The Hartree-Fock method includes this statement implicitly by assuming the wavefunction is a Slater determinant. This law is a consequence of having a system with a wavefunction that is antisymmetric with respect to interchanging coordinates. It is responsible for the degeneracy pressure seen in white dwarfs and neutron stars. For 10 points, name this requirement that Fermions in the same location must have different quantum numbers, a principle most often applied to the electrons in an atom.
