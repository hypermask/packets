Devices making use of this behavior can often be modeled as Butterworth-van Dyke equivalent circuits. Temperature-dependent resonant frequencies are a hallmark of resonators made out of materials with this property. It has direct and converse forms, the latter of which Langevin used in his sonar devices and the former of which is used in the quartz crystal microbalance. All ferroelectric materials have both pyroelectricity and this property. Crystals with this property, such as Rochelle salts, necessarily lack a center of symmetry. Discovered by Pierre and Jacques Curie, for 10 points, name this property in which voltage is generated by mechanical stress on a crystal.

Systems that become these later transition to a snow-plow phase and are absorbed by the surrounding medium. The r and p nucleosynthesis processes become dominant in these objects, which are thus the source of almost all heavy elements. Broadly, these occur because the specific binding energy curve is peaked, so fusion becomes energetically unfavorable after the formation iron - that leads to the nickel-iron core formation that proceeds the usual type of these.

One family of them uses zig and zag operations; another imposes five rules to maintain balance. Traversing one can be done preorder, inorder, or postorder, the last of which can be used to implement a depth-first search. An important special type of these is associated with a connected graph and can be found by using Kruskal's algorithm. In the simplest form of this organizing tool, the keys of all the nodes in the left subsection are less than the one at the top, and those on the right are greater - that applies to the binary search variety of them.
