answer: the {Navier}-{Stokes} equations

Deriving this equation in general requires the assumption that normal stresses sum to zero, which is a hypothesis named for one of this equation's namesakes; that hypothesis allows the usual right-hand side of this equation to be written as the divergence of the stress tensor. Including a magnetostatic body force term on the aforementioned right-hand side results in the MHD equations. In the high-deformability limit, this equation reduces to the Euler equation. Using the pi theorem on the usual form of this equation yields the Reynolds number. For 10 points, name this vector equation that governs the motion of continuous Newtonian fluids and that has solvability conditions that are an important open question in physics.

A subset of a Polish space with this property has countably many isolated points by the Cantor-Bendixson theorem. A set with this property each of whose points is an accumulation point is called perfect; in general, sets with this property contain all of their accumulation points. Subsets of Euclidian space that are bounded and compact necessarily have this property by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. A Set with this property contains all points with neighborhoods partly in the set, and so also contains points with neighborhoods partly inside and partly outside; such points are on the boundaries of the set. For 10 points, name this property exemplified by a range of real numbers including end values and possessed by sets whose complements are open.
