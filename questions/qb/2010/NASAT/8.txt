answer: {collective} farms [accept {general} equivalents; accept {collectivization} of {agriculture}; accept

In one country, this policy was implemented with Duris' Laws, while in another country, this policy was proposed in a series of 1957 “Theses” within the government of Matyas Rakosi. In the country with which this policy is most associated, its chief proponent called for its temporary halt in an article entitled “Dizzy with Success.” This policy created kolkhozys, resulted in the death of millions in the Holodomor, and was one of the most notorious aspects of the Five Year Plan. For 10 points, name this general term for agricultural production imposed on the Soviet Union between 1928 and 1940, in which producers shared their land and resources.

answer: friction

Systems affected by this phenomenon exhibit spring-like motion over very small distances in the Dahl effect. Its magnitude unexpectedly decreases at near-zero velocities in the Stribeck Effect. More commonly, it is described by the Coulomb model, which includes Amontons' laws, the first of which states that this force is independent of the contact area and the second of which claims that its magnitude is proportional to that of the normal force. The coefficient associated with this force is denoted by mu and is higher for the static type than the kinetic type. For 10 points, name this force that retards the motion of an object moving along a surface.

In one version of the myth concerning this figure, she was sprinkled with the juices of the aconite plant. Pliny notes that this figure pioneered the use of nets and linen and bore a son named Closter, who was the first to use the spindle. The forest nymphs stopped what they were doing when this daughter of Colophon, a dyer of Tyrian purple, performed her most famous action in spite of an old woman telling her to curb her pride. In spite of this, this figure depicted the infidelities of Zeus and hung herself in shame when she realized she could not hope to match Athena.

answer: War of the {Spanish Succession}

An early battle in this war saw the Irish Brigade defend the Po gate of the namesake city following the capture of the Duc de Villeroi. The talks that ended this war gave Britain the right to import forty eight hundred slaves to the Americas and were negotiated at Rastatt and Baden. This war included the early battle of Cremona, which preceded a attempt to take Vienna thwarted by the Duke of Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy.

answer: {Van Der Waals} equation of state

Materials that obey this relation have an interparticle potential proportional to d over r to the 6th power, assuming r is greater than d. The isotherm of this equation below the critical temperature was modified by Maxwell to include a flat portion, which removes the metastable states. It assumes the material in question consists of hard spheres of equal radius, and can be derived as a first-order truncation of the virial equation. It contains parameters for inter-particle attraction and particle volume, or a and b respectively. For 10 points, name this modification of the Ideal Gas Law, an equation of state named for a Dutch chemist.

In this play's third act, two characters respectively woo a woman by giving her a paragraph of fake Latin and a gamut containing declarations of passion. In its second act, a woman declares "If I be waspish, best beware my sting," although she later lectures two other women that "Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper." In this play's fourth act, its female lead agrees that the sun is the moon and the moon is the sun if the male lead thinks it is. Its frame narrative sees a Lord trick the drunk tinker Sly into thinking he is a noble, for whom the title play is performed. Its male lead has "come to wive it wealthily in Padua," and courts the title character so that Baptista will permit his daughter Bianca to marry.

answer: George Stanley {McGovern}

This man is the namesake of a 1977 report also called Dietary Goals for the United States. He lost his Senate seat to James Abdnor. In one speech, he told the Senate “this chamber reeks of blood” before urging the passage of an amendment he co-sponsored with Mark Hatfield. That 1970 amendment would have forced complete withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. During his presidential bid, he was forced to drop his original running mate, who had undergone electroshock therapy. He thus replaced Thomas Eagleton with Sargent Shriver. For 10 points, name this Senator from South Dakota who lost to Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential election.

answer: {transcription} factor [or {TF}; prompt on {DNA binding protein}]

One class of these proteins contain a winged helix or forkhead box domain, while another class of these is inhibited by Rb protein and regulates the production of cyclins, called E2F. Another class of these homodimerizes after being activated by the JAK kinase and regulates the production of interferon, and are known as the STAT proteins. An example of them from yeast used in various experiments is GAL4, which binds to UAS. They operate by recruiting coactivators or histone acetyltransferases and bind to consensus sequences. Many of these proteins contain a leucine zipper or a zinc finger. Basal ones include TFIID, which binds to the TATA box, and most contain an activating domain and a DNA binding domain. For 10 points, name these proteins responsible for recruiting RNA polymerase and promote their namesake process of RNA production.

Mary Seacole ran a hospital for soldiers injured on the front of this war, which William Howard Russell gained fame for reporting on. Tensions that led to this war increased when Russia insisted that another country follow the conditions of the Treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji, leading to fears that Russia was attempting to establish exclusive influence over that country in violation of the Straits Treaty. The treaty ending this war demilitarized the Åland Islands, made the Black Sea neutral, and prevented Russia from claiming the right to protect the Christians in the Ottoman Empire.

answer: {Tractatus} Logico-Philosophicus

One section of this work explains that in Parisian courts, cases of traffic accidents are reconstructed by using toy trucks and toy baby carriages to show the spatial relationships of the vehicles, which this work takes as an analogy for how the relationships in a proposition represent the world. It claims that statements which are not built atomistically from empirical facts are meaningless, and thus that mathematics is tautological and metaphysics describes nothing. By its end, this text challenges the usefulness of any language, and advises discarding this book itself as a ladder which has been climbed. Also suggesting to "pass over in silence" that which cannot be spoken of, its propositions were undermined years later by the same author's Philosophical Investigations. For 10 points, identify this text, which was organized in seven sections as a mathematical proof and written by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

Other poems by this author call publication the "Auction / Of the Mind of Man" and describe a phenomenon that "oppresses, like the Heft / Of Cathedral Tunes." This author of "There's a certain Slant of light" compared the treading of Mourners to the breaking through of sense in a poem whose speaker asserts "I felt a Funeral, in my Brain."

One of the last of these poems asks "I have brought the great ball of crystal; who can lift it?" The eighty-first of these poems concludes by repeating the phrase "Pull down thy vanity." The forty-fifth of them repeats the words "with usura," and was originally published as part of the "Fifth Decad" of these poems. Some of these poems are largely a collage of the writings of John Adams, while others were published under the title "Section: Rock Drill." A group of these poems praising Confucianism and including Chinese characters is usually known as the "China" ones. In 1948, the first Bollingen Prize was awarded to a group of these poems known as the "Pisan" ones. For 10 points, name this group of long, allusive modernist poems written by Ezra Pound.
