Leopold Godowsky composed fifty-three studies based on these pieces. In the first and eighth of these pieces, the right hand plays extensive arpeggios that require the pianist to engage the shoulder and arm muscles, unlike previous works in the same genre that focused on the fingers and wrists.

answer: the magnetic {susceptibility} [prompt on {chi}; prompt on {susceptibility}]

The Evans balance is used to measure this quantity. In MRI, the BOLD venography technique exploits differences in this property among tissues, oxygenated blood, and deoxygenated blood. Often separate static and frequency-dependent values of this are reported. In an isotropic material, the permeability is equal to the vacuum permeability times the quantity one plus this value. It is negative for diamagnetic objects. It can be obtained by dividing the magnetization by the applied magnetic field and is symbolized chi. For 10 points, name this measurement of a material's magnetization response to a magnetic field.

This location's namesake is credited with coining the phrase “Every man is the architect of his own fortune” and with inventing the letter Z, as well as having an epithet meaning “blind.” In 1776, Gavin Hamilton excavated a building on this site, discovering the “Braschi Venus” sculpture, among others. The need for this landmark was demonstrated after the Battle of Caudine Forks during the Second Samnite War, which revealed the difficulty a certain republic had in transferring supplies and personnel.

answer: {orbitals} [accept {molecular orbitals} before "one {type} of these"]

The sum of a perturbation and the Hartree-Fock operators to equal the Hamiltonian of one type of these entities is the result of Moller-Plesset theory, and the coupled cluster method can also be used to calculate that type. The Jahn-Teller effect prevents degeneracy in these, and the LCAO approximation simplifies calculations involving them. Overlap of two lobes of these creates pi bonds, and higher-energy molecular ones are considered "antibonding." For 10 points, name these wavefunction solutions with atomic s, p, d, and f types.

answer: the {determinant}

Uniquely, this associative multilinear operation commutes with similarity transforms and with both parts of Hermitian conjugation. A set of homogeneous, linear alegbraic equations can have a non-trivial solution only if the one of these corresponding to the coefficients is zero. Ratios of these give the solutions to inhomogeneous linear alegbraic equations through Cramer's rule. If this object is zero, its associated array is singular. This operation maps the square matrices over a set of numbers onto that set, returning an alternating sum of products of the matrix entries. For 10 points, name this operation given for a square matrix a, b, c, d as ad minus bc.
