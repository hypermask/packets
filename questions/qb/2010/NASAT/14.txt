answer: Diet of {Worms} [or {Reichstag zu Worms}]

As a result of this event, Henricus Vos and Johannes van den Esschen were executed. A meeting in Speyer temporarily retracted the central result of this event, which resulted in a proclamation authored by Girolamo Aleandro. The Archbishop of Trier, Johann Eck, spoke for the emperor who convened it. Frederick the Wise guaranteed that one man would have safe passage to and from this meeting. It took place the year after Pope Leo X issued the papal bull Exurge Domine, which demanded that a man retract forty-one errors in his writings. Instead of retracting his errors, that man allegedly stated at this meeting "Here I stand; I can do no other."

During the pathogenesis of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, one of these events results in the PML gene being under the control of the retinoic acid receptor. One of these puts the c-myc gene under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer in Burkitt's lymphoma. This is the mechanism for the formation of a structure which encodes the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase named for Philadelphia, which causes chronic myelogenous leukemia. The loss of two p arms occurs in the Robertsonian type of this, which is responsible for a small percentage of Down syndrome. They can be balanced or unbalanced depending on whether genetic material is lost in the process. For 10 points, name this moving of parts of one chromosome to another.

One incident in this conflict was Operation Praying Mantis, which occurred after the near destruction of the Samuel B. Roberts. The United States carried out Operations Earnest Will and Prime Chance during this conflict to protect ships during the “Tanker War” phase. The U.S. supplied “dump bombs” to one side in this conflict, although thanks to an illegal arms deal involving the Contras, it was also indirectly supplying the other side as well. During the waning days of this conflict, one side inflicted the Halabja poison gas attack on its Kurdish population. For 10 points, name this war that lasted between 1980 and 1988 and saw two Middle Eastern nations fight each other under the leadership of the Ayatollah Khomeini and Saddam Hussein.

The Heilbronn Problem is to find the set of points on the edge of a unit-area shape that maximizes the area of the smallest of these thus formed. The construction of one of these objects is the subject of a problem posed by Lemoine whose solution is the Kiepert hyperbola. These objects have two points defined by a certain angle all three of which are named for Brocard. Whether or not three lines in these objects will be concurrent can be determined using Ceva's theorem. One method of finding the area of these objects uses the semiperimeter and side lengths and is called Hero's formula. For 10 points, name these planar figures, the area of one of which is half its base times its height.

answer: the {Hall} effect

The magnitude of this effect and the sheet resistivity can be measured simultaneously in the four-contact van der Pauw method. The constant characterizing the process underlying this effect can then be written as one over the quantity fundamental charge times sheet density times sheet resistance - that quantity is the constant of proportionality between the charge drift velocity and applied electric field and is known as the mobility. This effect can be explained by considering the Lorentz force on a drifting charge carrier, so its sign determines the majority carrier in semiconductors. The magnitude of this effect scales with applied magnetic field, so it can be used to make sensitive magnetometers. For 10 points, name this electromagnetic effect, the creation of a voltage gradient perpendicular to an applied current in a magnetized material.

The NAIRU model for this phenomenon is advocated by Milton Friedman and proposes a baseline for it. Edmund Phelps's investigations into it yielded an expectations-augmented form of one model of it. Causes of this include sectoral shift, which has frictional and structural forms. Arthur Okun proposed that economic output decreases by two to three percentage points for every one percentage point this rate increases. Excluding changes from business cycles yields the natural rate of this phenomenon, and William Phillips observed a correlation between an increase in wages with a decrease in this. For 10 points, name phenomena in which willing people are unable to find jobs.

Flat, smooth areas in this biome are known as its namesake pavement. Because of Hadley cell circulation, these biomes are often found near latitudes of thirty degrees north and south. They are often found near mountain ranges because of the rain shadow effect. For 10 points, name this biome which is defined by its lack of precipitation.
