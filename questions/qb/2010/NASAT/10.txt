answer: {Louis}-{Philippe} [do not accept or prompt on partial answer]

This man's support of the Moderados, and the marriage of his youngest son to the sister of Isabella II, led to British accusations that he had violated the Treaty of Utrecht in the Affair of the Spanish Marriages. His break with Britain led him to ally closely with his right-wing foreign minister, François Guizot, and lose popularity at home. Earlier, this politician spent three years fighting for the Jacobins before following his commanding officer, Charles Dumouriez, in defecting to Austria. He came to power as a result of repressive laws, aimed to prop up the ministry of the Prince of Polignac. Prior to being satirized as a pear by Honore Daumier, he participated in the July Days that overthrew Charles X. For 10 points, name this ruler who took the titles of "citizen king" and "king of the French" in 1830 and ruled until the Revolutions of 1848 put Napoleon III on the throne.

answer: {helium} [or {He}]

This element is added to nitrogen and oxygen to form trimix. A dimer of this element has the weakest known chemical bond, though that dimer shouldn't exist according to molecular orbital theory due to two electrons in the sigma sub 1s star orbital. The nuclei of one isotope of this element can form Cooper pairs at low temperatures in a mechanism described by Lee and Osherroff; this was an early example of superfluidity. Because it is produced by the proton-proton chain, it is the second most abundant element in the universe. For 10 points, name this element with atomic number two.

answer: Ludwig Andreas von {Feuerbach}

One critique of this thinker notes that he is not satisfied with "abstract thinking," and instead wants "sensuous contemplation." In that critique, this philosopher's work is used as a springboard to claim that "philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it." This philosopher's major work breaks down God into various aspects, like a being who can be understood or as pure love. In that work, this man claimed that, in an attempt to understand the infinite, "the conscious subject has for its object the infinity of his own nature." He thus defined the title religion as the process of finding one's self in God. For 10 points, name this author of The Essence of Christianity, a philosopher about whom Karl Marx wrote eleven "Theses."

answer: "The {Murders} in the {Rue Morgue}"

One character in this story astonishes the narrator by tracing his train of thought from a fruiterer to street stones, stereotonomy, Epicurus, Orion, and the cobbler Chantilly. This story begins by asserting that excellence at chess merely requires calculation, while excellence at whist and checkers requires analysis. The central character of this short story observes the peculiarity of testimony by people of diverse nationalities, who all describe hearing a gruff voice in a language they do not understand. This locked room mystery describes the seemingly impossible deaths of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, who is found stuffed up a chimney.

answer: the {greenhouse} effect [prompt on {global warming}]

The "idealized model" of this effect requires parameters symbolized epsilon and alpha-sub-p. Compounds that promote this effect have high values of radiative forcing. An anti- form of this effect can cause thermocline inversion. The clathrate gun hypothesis is that compounds that cause this effect currently trapped in ice could be released due to it, setting up a positive feedback loop; such a loop could cause a runaway of this effect, which may have occurred on Venus. For 10 points, name this effect in which gases trap heat in the earth's atmosphere, a major mechanism of global warming.

answer: {Waggle} dance [prompt on {bee dances} or similar answers {involving bees}]

WH Kirchner showed that mutants unable to produce sound could not effectively perform this behavior. An organism performing this action release tricosane and pentacosane, and its effects are sometimes magnified by an accompanying trembling behavior. Organisms undergoing this behavior travel in a figure-eight shape with a return phase. Distances are encoded at a ratio of 75 milliseconds per 100 meters in this behavior. Originally elucidated by Karl von Frisch, this behavior communicates directions in terms of angle relative to the sun. Used to communicate the position of flowers, for 10 points, name this communicative dance performed by bees.

answer: the {weak} force [or {weak} interaction; prompt on {electroweak}]

In quarks, the strength of this interaction is governed by the Cabibbo angle. One mechanism governed by this interaction can couple to any non-gluon particle; that neutral current interaction provides the mechanism for scattering of neutrinos by ordinary matter. This interaction can change the flavor of quarks - in other words, it is responsible for the conversion of quarks into other types of quarks, which is seen in beta decay. This force is mediated by the W and Z bosons. For 10 points, name this fundamental force that at high energies merges with the electromagnetic force.

Reactions of nitric oxide are often treated as if they were of this order. This is the highest power of volume in the Redlich-Kwong equation of state. Apery's constant is the value of the Riemann zeta function at this number. According to the Debye [duh-BYE] model, specific heat is proportional to this power of the temperature. The asteroid denoted by this number is Juno. Algebraic equations of this order may be solved using the Tartaglia-Cardano formula. Monocots have a multiple of this number of petals. Platyhelminthes is the most primitive phylum to contain a mesoderm and, therefore, to possess this many germ layers. For 10 points, give this number that is also the number of nitrogen dioxide substituents on TNT.
