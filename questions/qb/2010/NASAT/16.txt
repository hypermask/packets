This man's namesake angle is defined by the intersection of the nasobasilar and nasosubnasal lines. In encephalitis, the spaces named for him and Robin around the brain's blood vessels become apparent. He names a triad consisting of venous stasis, trauma, and hypercoagulability that predispose a patient to venous thrombosis. This anatomy teacher to Franz Boas was a major opponent of Semmelweiss' hand-washing regime. He added the "functio lasa" condition to classic descriptions of inflammation.

answer: {boron} [or {B}]

An alloy of iron, neodymium and this element forms a tetrahedral structure in strongest permanent magnet known. A reagent containing this element has two atoms of it flanked by two cyclooctadine rings, and a class of reducing agents incorporating it have it bonded to 3 sec-butyl groups with a lithium counterion. Besides 9-BBN and the selectrides, this atom is also bonded to four hydride atoms with a sodium counterion in a gentler alternative to lithium aluminum hydride. One class of derivatives of this element are given prefixes like closo- and arachno-; many of those compounds dimerize via three-center two-electron bonds to satisfy the octet rule.

answer: Isadora {Duncan}

This artist opened a school in Grunewald whose six star pupils included Lisa Milker, Anna Denzler, and Irma Erich-Grimme, who later adapted her last name. The Delsarte technique inspired this artist to crusade against restrictive corsets and toe shoes, which she believed unnaturally restricted the force of gravity. She thought that the soul existed in the solar plexus, which she considered the source of bodily movements. Her admiration for ancient Greek culture led her to break from the artificiality of classical ballet and dance in a loose, natural style in free-flowing costumes and bare feet. For 10 points, name this American dancer, a leading pioneer of modern dance, who died of a broken neck in 1927 when her long, flowing scarf became caught in the wheel of a car.

answer: {ammonia} (accept {NH3} before mentioned)

One option for hydrogenating alkynes is to react them with a solution of sodium dissolved in this compound. Townes, Gordon and Zeiger applied a non-uniform electric field to this compound, causing a difference in dipole moments and stimulated emission. Iron-molybdenum protein complexes are found in diazotrophs that produce this compound, such as rhizobia. Terrestrial animals convert this compound to either urea or uric acid. It is the canonical molecule with trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry. Industrial production of it uses an iron catalyst in a modification first made by Carl Bosch. For 10 points, name this compound produced in the Haber process and which has formula NH3.

answer: {Sapir}-{Whorf} hypothesis [or {linguistic relativity}]

Kenneth Iverson argued that this concept applied to computer algorithms. The Kennenberg and Brown critique of this idea centers on the fact that its proposers never proved a causal relationship, and examines the distinction between blue and green. The discovery of eleven "color foci" by Paul Kay and Brent Berlin helped discredit this idea, and James Cooke Brown developed Loglan to test it. Geoffrey Pullum attempted to discredit this idea in an essay about an "Eskimo vocabulary hoax." This principle, which was described using an analogy of a canoe on a beach, was created to explain why the Hopi have a radically different concept of time than English speakers. For 10 points, name this statement that asserts that one's language determines one's thoughts and perceptions, a hypothesis named after two linguists.

This man proposed multiple realizability in his arguments against brain state theory. He countered many of his previous ideas in Representation and Reality. This thinker argued for the reality of mathematics in an indispensability thesis named for him and Quine. In the 1950s, he compared minds to computers in his theories on functionalism. XYZ replaces H2O in a thought experiment formulated by this man. He argued that we cannot be brains in a vat and argued against linguistic internalism and for externalism, which he illustrated by creating a thought experiment in which two worlds are exactly the same except for one minute difference.

answer: {invading England} [accept {invading Britain}]

Forts known as one man's “follies” were built in the nineteenth century to prevent this action from happening. One plan for achieving this goal included an aftermath in which Dr. Franz Six and his men would use the “Black Book” to find a list of people to be arrested immediately. An attempt to prevent this action from happening saw a failed 1801 raid on the forces of Latouche Treville at Boulogne. This action was prevented from happening by the following year's Peace of Amiens. A plan for achieving this was code named Operation Sea Lion and was cancelled after the failure of the Battle of Britain.

answer: {Bose}-{Einstein} condensates [or {BECs}; prompt on {condensates}]

The critical kinetic temperature in these systems is about three times h-bar squared times number density to the two-thirds, divided by the particle mass; that value is obtained by integrating the underlying particle distribution function maximum over wavevectors. A semi-classical model of these systems has each additional particle adding the ground state energy, so the Hamiltonian of these systems includes a term of the ground state potential times the square modulus of the wave function, as can be seen in the Gross-Piatevskii equation. That equation gives their ground state wave functions. Lasers can be used to create soliton trains in these materials, which may allow for the creation of extremely precise gyroscopes. They were first successfully created using rubidium in 1995 by Cornell and Wieman. For 10 points, name these compact, degenerate states formed near absolute zero from particles with integer spins.
