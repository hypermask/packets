answer: {inverses} (accept {pseudoinverses})

Moore and Penrose developed a formula for a generalized one of these applicable complex matrices. In multi-variable calculus, one of these can be found for a vector-valued function if its Jacobian is not zero. In logic, the one of these corresponding to a given statement is the converse its contrapositive. In single-variable calculus, the derivative of this map can be shown by the chain rule to be one over the derivative of its associated function. In order for a function to possess one of these, it must be bjiective, or both onto and one-to-one, as this maps a function's range onto its domain. For 10 points, give this type of object that, when combined with its associated object, returns the identity element.

answer: {aldehydes}

In transaminases that use PLP as a cofactor, the amine attacks one of these functional groups before being transferred to the product. A common substrate analogue in enzyme inhibition replaces the C-terminus with one of these functional groups. Hydration of these compounds produces hemiacetals, and they produce a chemical shift from 9.5 to 10.5 ppm on proton NMR. Reacting these compounds with ammoniacal silver nitrate produces a silver mirror in the Tollens test. The simplest member of this group is often used as a preservative, and this functional group features a carbon atom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single bonded to an atom of hydrogen. For 10 points, name this functional group that is similar to a ketone.

answer: {monopolistic} competition [prompt on {imperfect competition} before mentioned]

Paul Krugman developed a model of this type of market to explain international trade driven by economies of scale. Edward Chamberlain pioneered the theory of this type of market, whose individual firms have imperfect, but extremely elastic, long-run demand curves. In this kind of market structure, in which new firms have few barriers to entry, and each firm has only a small amount of market power. In this type of market, a large number of firms coexist by using advertising to differentiate their products, which have no significant non-price differences. For 10 points, name this type of imperfect competition in which a large number of buyers purchase similar products from a large number of sellers, who can in the short run behave like monopolies.

answer: {green fluorescent} protein [or {GFP}]

Replacing residues 147 and 204 of this protein with cysteine makes it an effective sensor of a compartment's glutathione redox potential. This molecule contains a posttranslationally-formed bond between glycine-67 and serine-65 to form a five-membered ring with tyrosine-66. That structure is located inside this molecule's beta-barrel, which protects the central feature from water. It is commonly used as a reporter gene by fusing it to the gene of interest, which allows one to localize the fusion protein. Osamu Shimomura isolated it from Aequorea victoria, a jellyfish. For 10 points, name this protein often used in biological research that emits a certain color light when excited.

answer: {Young's modulus} [or {elastic modulus;} or {modulus} of {elasticity}]

In the formula for Griffith's criterion, this value is inversely proportional to the energy release rate G. The area under the curve whose slope is this quantity is the toughness. Elastomers typically have a very low value for this quantity. This value can be determined for a material by taking multiplying one plus Poisson's ratio by twice the shear modulus. Below the yield strength, this value is the ratio of stress to strain. For 10 points, name this measure of an object's stiffness, a quantity having units of pressure that is sometimes named for an English physicist.
