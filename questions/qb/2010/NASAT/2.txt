answer: the {band gap} region

Quantum dots have the unusual property that changing their size alters this property, which is why their emitted wavelength is tunable. The increase of one in size with temperature change T is given by T squared times a constant alpha divided by T plus a constant beta according to Varshni's theorem. Chemically distorting a one-dimensional crystal can create additional ones in the Peierels distortion. This structure is the solid-state equivalent of the space between the LUMO and the HOMO. Materials that have an indirect one must emit a phonon during recombination, in which an electron moves from the top of it to the bottom. The Fermi level exists in the middle of it in doped materials. For 10 points, name this region which is prominent in insulators - a region forbidden to electrons, lying between the valence and conduction bands, the size of which determines many characteristics of semiconductors.

answer: free {radicals}

During the catalytic cycle of ribonucleotide reductase, cysteine-439 forms one of these, which is then transferred to the substrate and to a tyrosine residue. Potassium nitrosodisulfonate is a persistent example of one. N-bromosuccinimide is used in substitutions that have one of these as an intermediate, while a technique used to image them commonly uses TEMPO to trap them. Besides EPR, they are commonly created by hemolytic bond cleavage in species like peroxides. Reactive oxygen species are a subset of, for 10 points, these chemical species that contain an unpaired electron.

answer: the {ontological} argument [or clear knowledge equivalents]

One objection to this idea argues that its logic leads to the existence of a "Lost Island." A modal version of this idea argues that its conclusion cannot be proven, but that it is rational to accept its conclusion. According to Kant, this idea falsely assumes that existence is a predicate. Gaunilo rejected this idea, whose modal version was formulated by Alvin Plantinga. Descartes' Fifth Meditation puts forth a version of it based on the principle that necessary existence is one of the perfections of a conceivable all-perfect being. This argument is commonly phrased as "a being than which nothing greater can be conceived" must exist. For 10 points, name this argument for the existence of God developed by St. Anselm.

answer: {equilibrium}

Depending on whether a system is isobaric or isothermal, there may exist invariant, univariant or divariant forms of this condition, a fact reflected in the Gibbs phase rule. In chemistry, ICE charts may be used to calculate property values for a reaction in this state. Statics is the study of a form of this condition in which the net moments and forces on a are both zero. The thermal form of this condition is transitive according to the zeroth law of thermodynamics. Chemical ones of these are stable as Le Châtelier's principle states that a system perturbed from this state will shift back toward it. For 10 points, name this condition in which, roughly speaking, a system will not change over time unless acted upon by outside forces.
