answer: {silicon} [or {Si}]

Alternatives to the most common method for producing this element include one developed by REC that converts 3 atoms of its tetrachloride to one atom of its pure form. Different kinds of that pure form include upgraded metallurgical-grade and solar-grade. This element is reacted with methyl chloride to create precursors to synthetic polymers in the Muller-Rochow process. Those precursors contain this element and oxygen as their backbone and include PDMS. The photoactive region of most charge-coupled devices consists of a layer of this element. After oxygen, it is the second most abundant element in Earth's crust, and quartz is composed of its dioxide. For 10 points, name this element found directly below carbon on the periodic table, which is most commonly used in semiconductor devices such as microchips.

On the three unlucky, one lucky, and one ambiguous days of the calendar, she gave birth to her children, one of whom entered her mouth in the evening and exited her vulva in the morning, and was thus born every day.

answer: {tensors} [prompt on {matrices}]

The comma and semicolon derivatives act on these. Absolute ones are relative ones of weight zero. One manipulation technique of these is called index gymnastics. Antisymmetric ones change sign upon changing the order of two components. In Lorentzian spaces, the covariant and contravariant order of them are not the same, unlike in three-dimensional space. These can be contracted to produce vectors. The product of two of these is in general a new one with rank equal to the sum of their ranks. For 10 points, name these generalizations of scalars and vectors; mathematical objects generally representable as matrices.

answer: The {Theory} of the {Leisure Class}

The eighth and ninth chapters of this book argue that the evolution of society is impeded by the conservation of socially archaic traits. This book's second chapter describes how the perceived difference between the drudgery of women's work and the exploit of men's work led to the development of the central institution, which preserves the predatory instinct instead of the instinct of workmanship. This book argues that invidious distinctions motivate people to demonstrate status by deliberately wasting money, thereby showing that they are part of the title institution, whose members are exempt from hard labor.

One feature of some of these is extents. They can use index, linked, or contiguous allocation. Fully journaled ones allow for optimal fault recovery, but many only journal metadata. Unix-like ones often use inodes and, like databases, arrange data using variations on B-trees. Commonly, their basic units are called clusters and blocks; if the units corresponding to a given item are scattered in one, that one is fragmented. They must be mounted before use. For 10 points, name these protocols for organizing data on storage devices like hard drives, examples of which include Reiser, ext2 and 3, and FAT.

answer: {phenylalanine} [prompt on {Phe} and {F}]

A namesake ammonialyase of this amino acid converts it into cinnamate, and Seymour Kaufman first discovered the importance of the coenzyme tetrahydrobiopterin in this amino acid's hydroxylase. Nirenberg and Matthaei began decoding the genetic code by finding that the codon UUU encoded this amino acid. With aspartic acid it makes Aspartame. Chorismate mutase catalyzes the formation of prephenate, a precursor to both tyrosine and this other amino acid. Failure to convert this amino acid into tyrosine results in a buildup of phenylpyruvic acid in the metabolic disorder PKU. For 10 points, name this amino acid abbreviated Phe.

answer: {inverse}-{square} forces [or equivalents like one {over} distance {squared}; or one {over r}-{squared};

For a two-body system under a force of this kind, the Runge-Lenz vector is exactly conserved. According to Bertrand's theorem, among central forces, these are the only decaying ones that admit stable, closed orbits. Conservative forces of this type correspond to potentials that fall off directly with distance because taking the gradient of such a potential yields a radial vector with this dependence on radius. For 10 points, name this type of force that decreases with a certain power of distance, as exemplified by gravity and electromagnetism.
