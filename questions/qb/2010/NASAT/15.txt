answer: {P} waves (prompt on sesmic waves or compression waves before mentioned)

Slotnick gave a formula for the velocity of these phenomena based on depth. They show a dip-dependent NMO velocity signature in VTI media. These phenomena can propagate in a liquid, so their shadow zone ends at 140 degrees. Unlike their counterparts, the speed of these phenomena depends on the bulk modulus. The displacement in these waves is parallel to the direction of travel. They are faster than their counterparts, meaning they arrive at the surface first, hence their name. For 10 points, name these seismic compression waves, the counterparts of S waves.

Huitzilopochtli threw one of these objects belonging to Copil into Lake Texcoco. People were buried squatting and carrying a jade bead, which represented them, in the seventh trial on the journey to Mictlan. When people questioned Hanuman's reverence for Rama and Sita, he showed them that they resided in this object of his. Birds warned Sigurd of Regin's arrival after the former ate the one belonging to Fafnir. Ammit devoured the ones heavier than the feather of Ma'at. As a sacrifice to the sun gods, Aztec priests extracted these objects from living victims. For 10 points, name these organs through which a stake must be pushed to kill a vampire.

One document in support of this cause stated that "unfortunately, the overworked term 'genocide' is applicable" and led to the recall of the Foreign Service employee who wrote that dissent-channel communique, Archer Blood. This goal was opposed by the militias Razarkars and al-Shams, and its achivement led to the displacement into refugee status of many Bihari speakers. This goal was advanced by the militant Freedom Force, which was enraged that Yahya Khan had asked Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to become prime minister. Politically, it was advocated by the Awami League, whose leader Mujibur Rahman became president after this cause was won.

answer: {photons}

The ratio of the rate of emission of these particles to Auger ionization is proportional to the third power of atomic number. Dust particles lose momentum after interaction with these particles in Poynting-Robertson drag. Pair production generates an electron and positron from one of these particles. One cross-section for scattering of these particles by charges is given by eight pi over three times the square of the classical particle radius, that being the Thompson cross-section; another such cross-section is the Klein-Nishina formula. The energy of one of these is equal to Planck's constant times its frequency. For 10 points, name these particles that carry the electromagnetic force and travel at the speed of light because they are the quanta of light.

This philosopher explains his inability to understand interactions from sense-data, ending an essay that tackles skepticism by claiming the absolute certainty of a few beliefs. This philosopher argues that goodness is non-natural and indefinable in terms of other properties. This author invites the reader to substitute “pleasant” for anything in the sentence “Is it good that x is pleasant?” to argue that value cannot be analyzed in the open-question argument. That question is further examined by this philosopher for his refutation of the “naturalistic fallacy.” For 10 points, name this British philosopher who wrote Principia Ethica.

answer: the {fundamental} theorem of {algebra} [prompt on {FTA}]

The so-called lemma of d'Alembert [DAH-lum-ber] is an incomplete proof of this statement that can be completed using the Weierstrass extreme value theorem. A more direct proof of it uses Rouché's theorem to show that a function with a known number of the values in question has the same number as the function of interest. One corollary of this statement is that every polynomial with only real roots can be written a linear combination of linear and quadratic terms. For 10 points, name this theorem that states that every polynomial over the complex numbers has at least one root, the basic result in an important branch of mathematics.

answer: {Arrhenius} Equation

In polymer chemistry, an equation that includes the free volume fraction, the Doolittle Equation, better describes the temperature dependence of viscosity than this equation. The development of transition state theory led to the creation of an equation for more complex situations than this equation can handle; that equation is named for Polanyi and Eyring. In collision theory, the leading coefficient of this equation is replaced with the collision frequency, Z, and the steric factor, p. The right hand side of this equation more commonly contains a pre-exponential factor labeled A. For 10 points, name this equation that relates temperature and the rate constant.
