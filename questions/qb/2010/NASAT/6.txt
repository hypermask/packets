answer: {cognitive dissonance}

The "Forbidden Toy" experiment demonstrated that this effect depends on the severity of punishment. Elliot Aronson earlier found that it was stronger when an individual expended more effort joining a group.

This phenomenon arose when subjects were paid one or twenty dollars to enthusiastically describe boring tasks. For 10 points, name this phenomenon studied by James Carlsmith and Leon Festinger, in which an individual's actions and attitudes are at odds with each other.

Locally compact examples of these algebraic structures can be assigned Haar measures. All possible composition series of one of these objects are equivalent by the Jordan-Hölder theorem. One class of these has locally Euclidean structure and is named for Lie [LEE]. Another class of this type of object dictates the solvability of polynomials and is named for Galois [gal-WAH]. As with many algebraic structures, the set of commuting values in one of these is its center and one equal to its own center is Abelian. For 10 points, name these mathematical structures, each of which consists of a set endowed an associated operation for which there exist an identity and inverses.

answer: {Estrogen} [accept {Estradiol} ,{Estriol}, or {Estrone}]

A common inducible form of the Cre-Lox system fuses the Cre protein to a mutant T2 form of the receptor for this molecule. Raloxifine and Tamoxifen selectively inhibit the action of this compound in some organs, while with another hormone it increases the expression of steroid hormone binding globulin from the liver. This hormone, which is secreted by granulosa cells, is produced from precursors by aromatase, and a rise in this hormone results in the LH surge that triggers ovulation. Responsible for controlling the proliferation of the endometrium, its precursors include cholesterol and testosterone. Along with progesterone, its decline causes menopause. For 10 points, name this female sex hormone.

answer: quantum {tunneling}

In the WKB approximation, the probability of this process is given by e to the minus integral of the wave number between turning points, all over the square of one plus one-fourth the same exponential. The preformation probability times the rebound frequency times the probability of this process gives the rate of alpha decay in the Gamow [GAM-off] model. Because the wavefunction decays exponentially in regions of high potential, the wave function amplitude is in general non-zero outside of finite potential barriers, which explains this process. The transmission coefficient gives the probability of this process. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which a particle crosses a potential barrier of energy greater than its own energy, a process that is not classically allowed.
