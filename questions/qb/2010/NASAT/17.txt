answer: {vortex} [or {vortices}]

The frequency of creation of these entities from a long circular cylinder is governed by the Strouhal number. One of these named for Rankine consists of a free one surrounding a forced one. Van Karman names a process of shedding of so-called streets of these - one instance of that process created the resonant force that destroyed the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. They are similar to eddies except they contain no voids in their centers. Usually occurring in regions where the circulation per unit area is non-zero, for 10 points, identify these entities found in fluids; local regions of circulatory flow exemplified by cyclones and tornadoes.

answer: {carbon} monoxide [or {CO}; do not accept or prompt on "{carbon dioxide}"]

This molecule is the "gas" in the water-gas shift reaction used to produce hydrogen gas, and it can be produced by the reaction of concentrated sulfuric acid and formic acid. This molecule is reacted with impure nickel in the Mond process, and blast furnaces reduce hematite by reacting it with this molecule. It is produced by insufficient combustion of hydrocarbons, which is why running an automobile in an enclosed area can lead to high air concentrations of it. For 10 points, name this heteronuclear diatomic molecule that has over two hundred times as high a binding affinity for hemoglobin as oxygen does.

answer: {Pragmatism}: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking

The fourth section of this book begins by comparing people to fish living in a sea of "sensible facts" who are only briefly able to come in contact with the air of abstract ideas above them. The second section of this book argues that belief in an Absolute Mind allows a person to take "a moral holiday." The sixth section of this book critiques the correspondence theory of truth, and claims that truths are "made" by being verified by experience. This book's opening section, "The Present Dilemma in Philosophy," attempts to reconcile the rationalist and empiricist mindsets. It argues that ideas should be judged based on their "cash-value," meaning their practical consequences. For 10 points, name this 1907 book which outlined a new kind of American philosophy, written by William James.

answer: red {blood} cells [accept {RBCs}; or {erythrocytes}; or {erythroid cells}; or {haematids}]

The colony-forming unit CFU-E is central to the differentiation of these cells. As these cells differentiate, they switch from staining basophilic to staining acidophilic. A protein found in these cells is switched by the transcription factor GATA1 from an infant to an adult form. The hormone EPO regulates the production of these cells, which can be produced in an "extramedullary" manner in the spleen and liver. These biconcave cells lack a nucleus. For 10 points, name these that can be "sickle" shaped in a type of anemia, and carry oxygen using hemoglobin.

answer: The {Imitation} of {Christ} [or {Imitatio Christi}]

This work contains a chapter opening with "My child, you are not yet a brave and wise lover." Its third section consists of dialogues between a disciple and the voice of the title figure, and is called "Internal Consolation." This work was influenced by the Brethren of the Common Life, and the larger trend of devotio moderna. From the invention of the printing press until the early twentieth century, this book trailed only the Bible in the number of copies in circulation. For 10 points, name this work about spiritual living, which was written sometime around 1400 and is often attributed to Thomas à Kempis.

answer: language {isolates} [accept {isolates} after "{language}"]

A statement made by Gustaf Ramstedt, among others, says that the most prevalent of these should actually not be classified as one of them. That statement is the Altaic hypothesis, which concerns a language which includes seven "speech levels" and is written in Hangul. One of these languages is controversially thought to be the reason a nearby tongue saw initial /f/ become initial /h/; that ergative-absolutive language contains the word ezker, which is known to be the source of a Spanish root for "left." For 10 points, give this term, applying to Basque and Korean, which refers to languages that do not have any clear genetic relationship to others.

In the background of this work, a series of white buildings on a hill give way to the sea under an orange sky. On the right of this painting's foreground, a standing woman obscures her face with her right arm while grappling with the ropes that bind her. Behind the main figures of this painting, a turbaned gunman stands in the shadows and a soldier on a rearing horse draws his saber. It was its artist's second submission to the salon, after The Barque of Dante. For 10 points, name this painting that depicts the slaughter of Greek residents of the namesake island by Turkish oppressors, by Eugene Delacroix.

answer: {omega}

A test symbolized by this letter was developed by William Pugh to determine whether integer solutions exist to a given set of linear equations and inequalities. This letter denotes the density parameter found in the Friedman equation. This letter describes compounds like docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, where it indicates the position of the final double bond. Whereas upper asymptotic bounds of functions are denoted with big-O notation, lower asymptotic bounds are denoted this letter writ big. One quantity symbolized by this letter is equal to the inverse of the square root of the inductance times the capacitance in an LC circuit. For 10 points, name this Greek letter a capital one of which is used to denote a quantity equal to the projection of a surface from a point onto the unit sphere, the solid angle.

answer: {Richard} II Plantagenet [prompt on {Richard}]

Inspired by Giles of Rome's De Regimene Principum, this king encouraged his subjects to call him "your highness" and "your majesty," popularizing the use of those terms. During the reign of this king, a tax levied by the Bad Parliament incited a rebellion against him. This king's favorite advisers, such as Robert de Vere and Michael de la Pole, were condemned to death by the Lords Appellant during the Merciless Parliament. This son of Edward the Black Prince ended a threat to his rule after a meeting at Smithfield, where the mayor of London killed Wat Tyler. For 10 points, name this Plantagenet king of England who put down the Peasants' Revolt and was dethroned by Henry IV after ruling from 1377 to 1399.
