answer: the {mass} [prompt on {m}]

In quantum field theories the difference between the vacuum state energy and the next-highest state energy is this quantity's "gap." In nuclear physics, the binding energy is equivalent to the so-called defect in this quantity. In the matrix for the seesaw mechanism, both Dirac and Majorana terms for this quantity exist; that mechanism imparts this quantity to neutrinos. The continuity equation describes the conservation of this quantity in fluids. The Compton wavelength varies between particles as one over this quantity. Obtained in the standard model by symmetry breaking of the Higgs field, for 10 points, identify this quantity which when multiplied by the gravitational acceleration yields the weight.
