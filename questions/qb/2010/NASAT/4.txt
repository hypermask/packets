answer: {Lochner} v. New York [accept either order]

One brief in this case argued that the government "has a right to safeguard a citizen against his own lack of knowledge." That brief by Julius Mayer was addressed in the majority opinion written by Rufus Peckham, which led to this case's name becoming a participle used to accuse justices of making up law. The argument that the Fourteenth Amendment does not "enact" Spencer's Social Statics was put forth in Holmes's dissent. Starting an "era" of cases that knocked down regulations on working conditions, this case dealt with a violation of the Bakeshop Act.

answer: {Helicobacter pylori}

This organism dodges the immune system by expressing Lewis blood group antigens, and the most common strains are J99 and 26685. Virulent strains encode a toxin that binds to VIP54 and creates large vacuoles, known as VacA. They encode a Type IV secretory system in the CagA pathogenicity island, which also activates the SH2 kinase. A urease breath test can be used to detect this microaerophile, and the inflammatory response to it induces the secretion of gastrin from G cells. Treating infection with this organism involves two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor, and it was studied by Barry Marshall, who notably drank a solution of it to prove that it causes gastritis. For 10 points, name this bacterium responsible for many ulcers.

answer: {Tallahassee}

This city hosts free Shakespeare-in-the-park called the “Southern Shakespeare Festival.” A defunct airport in this city was named for a casualty in a 1922 dirigible disaster, the crash of the Roma. Besides Dale Mabry Field, this city contains an administrative building from which the odd demand for 666 Dunkin's Donuts was issued from student protester Marshall Ledbetter in 1991. Near this city was the Battle of Natural Bridge during the Civil War, in which students from what would become a major state university prevented the Union from capturing a certain Confederate capital. That university included a president named Doak Campbell and has an athletic team called the Seminoles. For 10 points, name this capital of Florida.

The founders of this movement were all students of the man who showed that the horse Clever Hans could not do arithmetic. One of its founders observed that chimpanzees use insight learning to solve tests such as using two short bamboo sticks to reach a banana. This movement argues that the mind groups objects by their similarity and proximity, which are based on the principle of pragnanz. A psychologist who helped found it discovered that a series of slightly different stationary images create the illusion of movement, an illusion known as the phi phenomenon. For 10 points, name this school founded by Kurt Koffka, Wolfgang Kohler and Max Wertheimer, which studies how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

answer: {flux} [accept {more specific} answers {such} as {neutron flux}, {electric flux}, {magnetic flux}, etc.]

A quantity of this name for neutrons is multiplied by the macroscopic fission cross-section to give the fission reaction rate in a nuclear reactor. In a type-II superconductor, the usual version of this quantity is quantized for the H field when the applied field is between two critical values; the inverse of that quantum is the Josephson constant. For electromagnetic energy, this quantity is represented by the Poynting vector. Fick's first law states that this value for a given quantity is equal on net to minus the diffusion constant times the gradient of that quantity. For the electric field, this quantity through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge according to Gauss's Law. For 10 points, name this quantity, equal to the rate at which some physical quantity passes through a location per unit area.

answer: "{Pastoral}" Symphony [or Ludwig van {Beethoven's} Symphony No. {6}]

In the third movement of this symphony, a bassoon attempts to accompany a theme played by the oboe, but can only play the two notes F and C. At the end of its second movement, an oboe, a flute, and a clarinet respectively imitate the calls of a quail, a nightingale, and a cuckoo. In its fourth movement, a five-note passage for the cellos is played along a similar four-note passage for the double basses, creating an ominous rumbling before the entrance of timpani imitating the sound of thunder during a furious storm. This symphony's five movements include ones titled "By the Brook," "A merry gathering of country folk," and "Cheerful impressions awakened by arrival in the country." Premiered in 1808 along with its composer's C minor fifth symphony, for 10 points, name this Beethoven symphony that portrays rural life and nature.

One aspect of this god was worshiped in an airtight cylindrical temple, represented all the cardinal directions, and blew the sun and moon into place. In one story, this god slept with his celibate priestess sister, burning himself to death in shame. This god's heart became the morning star, the twin brother of Venus.

In gas chromatography, this word describes a product obtained when silyl groups are added to a molecule of interest to reduce polarity. In multi-variable calculus, one operator with this name is the dot product of a unit vector with the gradient, known as the directional this. In biochemistry, this term refers to a molecule that is synthesized by slightly modifying a given compound, usually by adding a named group - for example, aniline is an amino one of these of benzene. In single-variable calculus, the nth of these of a given function appears in the nth coefficient of the Taylor series of that function. For 10 points, give this common word the one of which from calculus can be used on both dividends of an apparently indeterminate limit according to l'Hôspital's [low-pee-TALZ] rule.

A common method of reducing these compounds involves using a catalyst containing 3 P-Ph-3 groups and one chlorine atom bound to ruthenium, a method which has largely been replaced by Crabtree's catalyst. Reacting them with carbenes is a common method of producing cyclopropanes. A series of these compounds alternating on a long side chain serves as a chromophore in retinal. When they are reacted with osmium tetraoxide, diols are formed. Acid halides add to these compounds such that the halide adds to the more substituted carbon, a rule named for Markovnikov. For 10 points, identify this class of compounds that can be either cis or trans and are characterized by carbon-carbon double bonds.

This structure is found immediately ventral to the pouch of Douglas. Scarring in this organ can lead to Asherman's syndrome, and Gartner's ducts may remain in the broad ligament of this organ rather than vanishing during gestation. Agenesis of this organ occurs in MRKH syndrome, and this organ can also be bicornate or unicornate in other malformations. This organ's lining, the endometrium, is sloughed off during menstruation, and when zygotes implant outside of it, ectopic pregnancy occurs.
