answer: {viscosity}

A so-called bulk or second variety of this property exists, but is unimportant in the incompressible case. This property can decrease over time in response to applied shear, a phenomenon known as thixotropy. This quantity appears multiplying the axial length and volumentric flow rate in the usual form of Poiseuille's equation. The effects of this property dominate at low Reynolds' numbers as this quantity is the denominator of the Reynolds number. This quantity appears as the constant of proportionality between the sheer stress and perpendicular velocity gradient for a Newtonian fluid. This property increases with temperature for gases but decreases for liquids; relatedly, for a superfluid below the lambda point, this property has a value of zero. For 10 points, name this measure of a fluid's internal resistance to flow.

answer: ideal {gas} constant [or {universal gas} constant; prompt on {R} before mentioned]

This quantity is equal to the molar mass times the difference in specific heat between a constant pressure and constant volume process. The specific heat capacity of a crystal can be approximated by three times this quantity, divided by the molar mass, according to the Dulong-Petit Law. It is equivalent to the product of Avogadro's number and the Boltzmann constant, and equals 8.314 joules per mole Kelvin. It is multiplied by temperature in the Arrhenius equation, the Nernst equation, and the equation that describes its namesake fluids. For 10 points, what fundamental constant symbolized R is used to unify such equations as Charles' Law, Gay-Lussac's Law, and Boyle's Law?
