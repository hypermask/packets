answer: the {sun} [or {sol}]

This body's differential rotation combines with magneto-hydro-dynamic effects to form a magnetic field known as the Parker spiral. Thermal columns in the convection zone cause the granulation of this body. The discovery of flavor oscillation resolved this body's namesake “neutrino problem.” “Bow shock” is the phenomenon in which the flow of plasma from this body is interrupted by a planetary magnetic field. It creates its namesake “wind” as its corona expands into space. For 10 points, name this star that is one astronomical unit away from Earth.

answer: {index} of {refraction} [or {refractive index}; prompt on {n}; prompt on {IR}; do not prompt on partial answers]

The relationship between this quantity and wavelength is defined by the Sellmeier equation, which models dispersion. Taking the arctangent of the ratio of this quantity for two materials gives Brewster's angle. For two materials, the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence at an interface equals the ratio of this quantity for both materials, a result that derives from Fermat's principle of least time. For 10 points, name this physical property that can be determined from Snell's law, defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a given medium to that in a vacuum.

These objects are the subject of a law that equates their temperature to the constant b over the peak wavelength. You can take that temperature to the fourth power, and multiply by the constant sigma, to find the energy flux density of one of these objects. One law that attempted to model the spectral radiance of these objects led to the “ultraviolet catastrophe.” The classical Rayleigh-Jeans law for their spectral radiance was replaced by Planck's law. For 10 points, name these ideal physical objects that absorb all external radiation, and thus would appear very dark.
