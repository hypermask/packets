answer: cell {membrane} [or {plasma membrane}; or {plasmalemma}; prompt on {phospholipid bilayer}]

This structure becomes invaginated and buds inwardly in a process mediated by clathrin. During apoptosis, this structure bulges out in a process known as “blebbing.” Signaling proteins that span this structure often have a seven alpha-helix motif.

answer: {parallel}

In hyperbolic geometry, two figures with the “ultra” form of this property must share a perpendicular, and two geodesics with this property with respect to a third can intersect. Given a line and a point not on the line, Playfair's axiom states that only one figure with this property can be drawn. If two lines intersect a third line, and the interior angles on one side sum to less than 180 degrees, the lines will not have this property, according to Euclid's fifth postulate. For 10 points, name this term that identifies lines in a plane that do not intersect.

answer: {hydrogen} bonds [accept word forms like {hydrogen bonding}; or {H}-{bonds}; prompt on {hydrogen} or {H}]

An alcohol with formula C13H28O uniquely cannot undergo these interactions because of its large tert-butyl groups. Hoogsteen base pairing employs these interactions, which are strongest when they are symmetric. Typically, nitrogen, fluorine, and oxygen facilitate these interactions, which are stronger than van der Waals interactions. These interactions can form a dimer of H2O. They cause the hexagonal lattice of ice crystals and the high boiling point of water. For 10 points, name these bonds, which are named after an element with atomic number one.

answer: {friction} [or drag before “{electrostatic}”]

This force is represented by a first derivative with respect to position in the harmonic oscillator equation. In one model, this force stems from tiny electrostatic repulsions. It can be understood as the parallel shear component of the contact force, whose other component is typically calculated as mg cosine theta. It is calculated from a coefficient, symbolized mu, multiplied by the normal force. Rolling motion is affected by the “kinetic” type of this force, which is known as “drag” in fluids. For 10 points, name this force that resists the motion of objects against one another.

answer: {nuclear fission} [prompt on {nuclear chain reaction}; do not accept “{nuclear fusion}” or “{fusion}”]

This process is modeled in an equation that uses the four factors, including thermal utilization and resonance escape velocity. The number of particles required to sustain this process is the “effective neutron multiplication factor,” k. Beryllium is used as a neutron reflector to reduce this phenomenon's necessary supercritical mass. Breeder reactors facilitate this process, which can sustain itself in a “chain reaction.” For 10 points, name this process in which large atomic nuclei break down into smaller parts, which was used in the atomic bombs dropped on Japan.
