answer: {prime} numbers [or {primes}]

If you multiply two of these values and find the Euler totient function of the product, you can create public and private keys symbolized d and e. Whether a given number is one of these values is tested using an algorithm named for Miller and Rabin. One naïve test for these values, named for Fermat, gives false positives called Carmichael numbers. The difficulty of factoring composite numbers composed of two of these numbers is the basis of RSA encryption. For 10 points, name these non-composite numbers with only two divisors, one and themselves.

answer: {superconductivity} [or {superconductors}]

This property's emergence can be modeled by a second-order phase transition with an order parameter proportional to the attractive potential between electrons. This property, which has characteristic lengths called the penetration depth and coherence length, can be understood as the condensation of Cooper pairs. Some materials with this property are perfect diamagnets that expel internal magnetic fields via the Meissner effect. BCS theory models Type I materials with this property. For 10 points, name this property in which materials have zero electrical resistance.
