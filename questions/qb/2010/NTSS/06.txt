answer: {irrational} numbers [accept {J}]

Numbers from this set are multiplied to generate Beatty sequences, and Apéry's theorem states that the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one over n cubed is one of these numbers. The reals can be constructed by exploiting the fact that this set's complement lacks the least upper bound property; that procedure is known as creating Dedekind (DEH-duh-kend) cuts. A classic proof for the existence of this set constructs an example by considering the equation x squared equals two y squared, deriving a contradiction because y must be both odd and even. Examples of these kinds of numbers include e, the square root of two, and pi. Give the name of this set of numbers that cannot be written as a simple fraction of two integers.

answer: Pablo {Neruda}

This poet suggested that Spain had been murdered in his work “Curse”, which appears in the collection Spain in Our Hearts. In another poem, he says that he will live on through a woman's marvelousness, though to survive he forged her “like a weapon”. He later wrote of the same woman, “I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her,” in the poem “Tonight I can write the saddest lines”. This poet wrote odes to many objects, including an arti- choke, salt, and his socks. One work, which ends, “Speak through my words and my blood,” is “The Heights of Mac- chu Picchu”, found in the collection Canto General (KAHN-toh heh-neh-RAHL). Identify this Chilean poet who wrote Twenty love poems and a song of despair.

answer: {Anne}

This monarch had a close friendship with Sarah Churchill which ended when Churchill became jealous of Abigail Masham and, with the Scottish Militia Bill, this leader became the last British monarch to use a veto. Because of the first Acts of Union, this leader was the first monarch to head the Kingdom of Great Britain. This leader was suc- ceeded by George the First because none of her children lived to adulthood, in part because she suffered through many miscarriages, which transferred the monarchy to the House of Hanover from the House of Stuart. Name this queen who ruled during the War of Spanish Succession, the successor of William and Mary.

answer: Johannes {Brahms}

A string quintet by this composer is nicknamed Prater, and he also wrote twenty-five variations with a concluding fugue based on Handel's Harpsichord Suite Number One. This composer wrote two overtures during the summer of 1880. In one of them, the second theme is started by an oboe and taken over by trombones--that is the Tragic Over- ture. The other one, which is much more upbeat, was written because of an honorary doctorate given by the Univer- sity of Breslau. This composer used a Lutheran Bible as the basis for his most extensive work. Name this nineteenth century composer of Academic Festival Overture, A German Requiem, and a well-known lullaby.

answer: index of {refraction} [or {refractive} index; prompt on {n} before the end; prompt on a partial answer]

This quantity in two materials can be compared using the Becke line test. This quantity can take on three different values in biaxial materials, and it is related to wavelength in Cauchy's (koh-SHEEZ) equation. This quantity is almost constant in fused silica, and equals the cosecant of the critical angle of a material. This measure varies inversely with both the speed and the wavelength of light within a medium, with its lowest possible value, one, used for vacuums. Name this quantity used in Snell's Law, the ratio of the speed of light in a particular medium to the speed of light in a vacuum.

answer: {Sargon} I [or {Sargon} the {Great}; or {Sargon} of Akkad]

This ruler had victories over Kashtubila (kahsh-too-BEE-la), Luhi-ishan (lu-hi-i-SHAN), and Lugalzagesi (lu-gal- zah-GEE-see). This leader was, like Moses, abandoned in a basket in a river as an infant. Upon his death, this em- peror was succeeded by his sons Rimush (ri-MOOSH) and then Manishtushu (ma-neesh-TOO-shoo). According to legend, he was a cupbearer to Ur-Zababa before becoming King. It is difficult to date his reign because his capital has not been found, but historians believe he came to power around 2270 BCE. Name this leader who conquered much of Sumer from his base in Akkad.

answer: {linked lists} [do not accept partial answers]

These are the basic data structure in Lisp, and in many functional languages, are implemented via cons [KAHNZ] cells, each with a head and tail. They do not support efficient indexing, but do have faster insertion and deletion than arrays, and need not be contiguous in memory. These structures can be classified as “single-” or “doubly-”, and they also can be classified as “linearly” or “circularly”. Name this type of data structure in which each node contains two fields, one containing the value and the other containing the location of the next value.

answer: {Laffer} Curve

Named after a founding member of the Congressional Policy Advisory Board, this concept has a prohibitive range inside of which the economic effect outweighs the arithmetic effect. The supporters of this concept point to the short- term impacts of the economic policies of Coolidge, Kennedy, and Reagan, while its detractors point to the long-term impacts of the same policies. Its founder has justified it by using tax revenue projections in his home state of Califor- nia, and its supporters generally argue for tax cuts. This concept was named by Jude Wanniski, who claims he first saw it at a dinner with Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney drawn on a napkin. Name this graph based on the idea that no income is brought in by either a zero or one hundred percent tax rate.

Beings of this type cause the death of Svafrlami (sva-fir-LAH-mee) to avenge their slavery, and these creatures in- cluded Northri (NORTH-ree), Suthri, Austri, and Vestri, who upheld the heavenly dome and represented the four cardinal directions. Another one of these creatures is Andvari, who possesses the ring Andvarinaut that makes gold until it is taken by Loki (LOH-kee). The first two of these creatures were Mótsognir and Durinn. One of them, Alviss, was tricked by Thor and turned to stone when he was exposed to sunlight. These beings were responsible for building Odin's spear Gungnir and Thor's hammer Mjölnir. Name these metal-workers who in later tales were por- trayed as being shorter than humans.

answer: “The {Gift} of the {Magi}”

This story suggests that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating, and it imagines King Solomon as a janitor and the Queen of Sheba living in a nearby apartment. The woman in this story, who re- cently paid a visit to Madame Sofronie, is given objects made of pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims that she had seen in a window display on Broadway. She receives them from James Dillingham Young, who in turn receives a plati- num chain. This story begins with Della counting out one dollar and eighty-seven cents, and it ends with an exchange of Christmas presents that is ironic because Della had her hair cut. Identify this short story by O. Henry.

Crocodiles have two of these structures separated by a hole called the foramen of Panizza (puh-NEEZ-zuh), and fish have one in front of and one behind the lamellar lacunae (laa-KOO-nay). Women with Turner's syndrome often have coarctation (co-ark-TAY-shun) of this structure, whose wall can rupture in a usually fatal condition called dis- secting aneurysm. The descending section of this structure separates into thoracic (thoh-RAA-sihk) and abdominal segments while the sinuses of Valsalva lead to is first branches, the coronary arteries. Originating from the left ventri- cle of the heart, name this blood vessel with a characteristic arch, the largest artery in the body.

answer: {orthogonality} [accept {perpendicularity}; accept {normality}; accept word forms of any of the answer

One sequence of polynomials with this property begins one, then x, then three-halves x squared minus one half; the integral of any product of two of those from negative one to one equals zero. This term also refers to a specializa- tion of unitary matrices, namely, matrices whose transposes equal their inverses. A set with this property can be pro- duced by recursively subtracting vector projections; that is a basis produced by the Gram-Schmidt process. This term also describes vectors whose inner product, or dot product, is zero; as well as two lines whose slopes are opposite re- ciprocals. Give this property which applies to adjacent sides of a rectangle.

answer: calorimeter

NASA has sent an X-ray absorption version of this device into space, and H. L. Callendar improved the tradi- tional type by adding a platinum-resistance gauge. Robert Bunsen developed the standard ice version of this device, though Laplace (luh-PLAHS) and Lavoisier had used a more primitive one in 1780 to show that respiration is a form of combustion. The Atwater-Rosa type of this device proved that the human body obeys the conservation of energy, while an adiabatic jacket surrounds the most common type, containing an ignition unit, oxygen supply, and steel bomb. Easily made in the lab from a thermometer and two coffee cups, identify this device that uses change in tem- perature to measure the heat associated with a reaction.

Near the end of this war, Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot took over for Marshal Mac-Mahon. That followed French losses at the Battles of Mars-La-Tour and Gravelotte. It was started by a dispute over whether a Hohenzollern could claim the Spanish throne which came to a head upon the release of the Ems Dispatch. Culminating with the Battle of Sedan, this war was ended by the Treaty of Frankfurt, which took much of Alsace and Lorraine away from France. Name this war that ended the reign of Napoleon the Third which took place in 1870 and 1871.
