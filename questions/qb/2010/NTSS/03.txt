answer: {neutralization} reaction [prompt on {acid}-{base reaction}]

The rating of lubricant oils by degree of oxidative degradation employs this type of reaction, while another reaction of this type follows the alkaline hydrolysis step in sulfonamide production. The precipitation of yellow cake uranium relies on magnesia in this type of reaction, and a solution is often said to be at half-this if it is buffered. One product of this reaction is always an addition compound according to the Lewis theory, and a rare endothermic example is the re- action between baking soda and vinegar. Occurring in the common type of titration, identify this chemical reaction in which an acid and base combine to form a salt and water.

answer: median

In image processing, this statistic is used to reduce salt-and-pepper noise. It can be estimated by Pareto interpola- tion, and for continuous distributions this statistic cannot be more than one standard deviation from the mean. For a distribution, this is the point that minimizes the average of the absolute deviations. It can be defined as the spot where the cumulative distribution function equals one half. A measure of central tendency, it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. Name this value that can be found by finding the value at the fiftieth percentile or, for finite sets with an odd number of elements, the middle number of the set.

answer: {convergence} [accept word forms]

The uniform and pointwise types of this property may be contrasted for sequences, and Cauchy sequences in a complete space always have this property. A limit approaching zero is necessary but not sufficient for this property, which exists when the root test gives a value less than one or the integral test gives a finite number. The harmonic se- ries lacks this property, but the alternating version thereof as well as p-series for p greater than one do have this prop- erty. This term also applies to geometric series with ratio between negative one and one. Give this term that describes series whose sum approaches a finite number, contrasted with divergence.

answer: Michael {Faraday}

One object named for this man is used in regenerative amplifiers; that is his namesake rotator, and is based on the effect of light's polarization plane rotating, which is also named for him. He may have been the first to represent vector fields using lines of force, and also was the first to insulate a room with metal foil to block electric fields, creating his namesake cage. Lenz's law is responsible for the negative sign in his namesake law, which relates induced voltage in a current loop to the time-derivative of magnetic flux and was included with Gauss's and Ampère's laws in Maxwell's equations. Name this scientist with an eponymous law of electromagnetic induction, an Englishman.

answer: Edwin {Hubble}

The findings of this person resolved the Shapley-Curtis debate, and he discovered the asteroid now known as 1373 Cincinnati. This person's name is associated with NGC 2261, a variable nebula he observed when he became the first person to look through the Hale Telescope. His tuning-fork diagram separates spiral from barred spiral galaxies, and he showed that Andromeda was not a nebula, but a separate galaxy outside the Milky Way. An approximate age of the universe is given by the inverse of this man's namesake constant, which also appears in his law stating that the velocity of objects receding from the Earth is proportional to their distance; a fact he established by observing the red- shift of galaxies. Famous for proving that the universe is expanding, name this man whose model of the cosmos con- tinues to be supported by the observations of the space telescope named for him.
