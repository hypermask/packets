Animals in this class have bodies that consist of a prosoma and opisthosoma (oh-PISS-thoh-soh-muh), and the largest of them that ever lived were aquatic species called eurypterids (yoo-RIHP-tuh-ridz). Orders within this class are distinguished by the shape and function of the pedipalps, and some members of this class take in oxygen through soft overlapping flaps inside the abdominal cavity known as book lungs. Apulmonate members of this class include the Acari, which consists of mites and ticks. The species Androctonus in this class can kill humans with a neurotoxin; that species is better known as the fat-tailed scorpion. More famous for the ability of some of its members to spin silk, name this class that includes harvestmen and spiders.

answer: {limit}

This term can be used as an adjective to describe a set that represents the state of a dynamical system after an infi- nite amount of time or to describe a point that can also be called an accumulation point. This term also is applied to values whose existence can be proven using the squeeze theorem or a method referred to as delta-epsilon. These values are often evaluated by taking the derivatives of both the numerator and denominator of a rational function, a method known as l'Hôpital's rule. These values are equal to the values of continuous functions, and they are commonly used to find derivatives. Give this value that the output of a function may approach when the input approaches a specified value.

answer: Ferdinand {Marcos}

There were rumors that this man's father was Judge Ferdinand Chua, who made arrangements to clear him for the murder of Julio Nalundasan.

This scientist's namesake constant is calculated by dividing e times h by the quantity four pi times mass and closely approximates the magnetic moment of a free electron, though it failed at its original purpose to explain the Balmer se- ries. The namesake of that constant, or magneton, said that quantum theory should agree with classical theory when classical theory could be verified, and he also supported quantum mechanics in debates with Albert Einstein. Name this man who proposed a planetary atomic model that only worked for hydrogen, a Danish physicist.

answer: {cosine} [accept addition of “of x ” or any other variable ]

The fixed point of this function is known as the Dottie number, and this function equals the real component of the value of e raised to the power of i times x. The derivative of the inverse of this function equals negative one over the square root of the quantity one minus x squared, and the graph of its hyperbolic version is known as a catenary (KAA- tuh-nehr-ee). Its namesake law can be used to determine the length of the third side of a triangle given the two other sides and the included angle and is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to any triangle. Give the name of this function equal to both the x-coordinate on a unit circle and the length of the adjacent leg divided by the hypotenuse of an angle in a right triangle.

answer: {gallium} [accept {Ga} before the end]

Medical uses for this element depend on the body treating it like the ferric ion, and though it is not iodine, it has been used to correct the hypercalcemia associated with malignant bone cancer. This element was the first to be crystal- lized by molecular-beam epitaxy in order to produce thin wafers of its widely used arsenide semiconductor. The trans- formation of this element into germanium is the basis for neutrino-detecting telescopes, and it is the metal most often used to construct light-emitting diodes. Its discovery by Boisbaudran in 1875 confirmed the existence of Mendeleyev's eka-aluminum, and it has the largest liquid temperature range of any element. Famous for melting when held in the hand, name this element with atomic number 31 and symbol Ga.
