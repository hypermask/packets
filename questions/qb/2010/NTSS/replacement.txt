answer: {gravity} [or {gravitation}, etc.; accept {gravity brightening} or {gravity darkening}]

Stars can appear to be brighter at their poles in this phenomenon's namesake darkening. The Eötvös experiment concerned this force, whose balancing point with outward radiation is the Eddington limit. Its namesake waves were reported by Hulse and Taylor, and its namesake constant was first measured using a torsion balance by Cavendish. General relativity has supplanted Newton's model of this force, which treated it as an inverse-square phenomenon. With its namesake acceleration on earth about equal to 9.81 meters per second squared, name this weakest fundamen- tal force, which is exclusively attractive and acts between objects with mass.

answer: Darwinian {fitness} [or {adaptive value}; or {selective value}]

The probability distribution of phenotypes is part of Hartl's definition of this concept, and an altruistic act must increase this quantity to pass Hamilton's rule. The inclusive variety of this explains why worker bees care for their sis- ters, and when most alleles are neutral for this quantity, genetic drift overtakes natural selection. Most courtship be- havior is driven by the relative type of this quantity, for which mules rate a zero. Generally decreased by inbreeding and increased by adaptability, identify this evolutionary measure of reproductive success, the contribution of an indi- vidual to the gene pool of the next generation, which usually goes up the longer an individual survives.

answer: {cadmium} [accept {Cd} before the end]

The first biological role for this element was discovered in 2000 when it was found in the carbonic anhydrase en- zyme of marine diatoms, and the first spectroscopic definition of the meter was based on this element's red line. Along with bismuth, lead, and tin, this element comprises the alloy known as Wood's metal, and it is the only element in Group 12 that can form complex ions with chloride. The only ore mineral with this element is greenockite. This metal is the basis for the highest-grade yellow pigment, but its ingestion causes itai-itai disease, which includes severe osteo- porosis. Combined with nickel in most rechargeable batteries, identify this transition metal with atomic number 48 and symbol Cd.

answer: stalagmite

These geologic structures can be distinguished from similar phenomena because they lack a central canal, and cal- cite pearls often grow under conditions that do not support the formation of these structures. Rare basalt examples of these structures fill a chamber in Iceland's Arnahellir lava tube, while the ice-type is common in mines where tempera- tures are markedly higher at the ceiling than the floor. Most of these structures occur in karst topology, like the Hall of Giants and Witch's Finger in Carlsbad Caverns, and they are the only dripstone formations that cannot collapse under their own weight. Name these structures that grow from the dripping of calcium carbonate-rich water onto the floor of a limestone cave, sometimes forming the bottom half of a column with a neighboring stalactite.

answer: {centroids} [prompt on {center} of {mass}; prompt on {center} of {gravity}]

This point is collinear with the Nagel Point, incenter, and Spieker center. It is always twice as far from the ortho- center as from the circumcenter, and it is collinear with those points together with the nine-point circle center. Its barycentric coordinates never change, and it always is located in the interior of the triangle. This point is a point of concurrency of three cevians (CHAY-vee-uns), and the ratio of each of the smaller segments of those cevians to point of concurrency is 2 to 1. If a triangle is made of uniform density, this point is located at the center of mass. Name this point of intersection of the medians of a triangle.

This result can be calculated by taking the inverse of the quantity A transpose A, end quantity, times A transpose B, where matrix A has a column of ones on its left or right side. That equation finds what is often considered the “op- timal” solution to an overdetermined system. The accuracy of this result is measured by the square of the correlation coefficient, which equals one for perfect linear fits. Name this process of producing a line that approximately goes through a set of given points.

answer: Henry Ross {Perot}

This entrepreneur helped start the “No Pass No Play” rule in Texas. A subject of Ken Follett's On Wings of Ea- gles, this man hired Arthur “Bull” Simmons to rescue two of his employees from Iran. The first company he started was sold to GM for over two billion dollars, and the second company he started was sold to Dell for over three billion dollars. This man's political career was hampered by his unproven allegations that his opponent planned on using nude pictures of this man's daughter and by his selection of James Stockdale. Name this opponent of the first Iraq War and NAFTA who ran for President in 1992 and 1996 as a third-party candidate.

answer: {Pragmatic Sanctions}

The best-known example of one of these rulings followed a decree given by the Kingdom of Croatia and the Pac- tum mutuae successionis of 1703. One of these restored the Decree of 1789, while another one issued in 1438 at Bourges gave some independence to the Gallican Church from the Roman Church. Defined as a decree which be- comes law, it generally refers to decrees given by the Holy Roman Emperor. That best known example failed to pre- vent the War of Austrian Succession. Name the 1713 ruling by Charles the Sixth that allowed women to rule the Habsburg Empire.

The British were able to establish a presence in this modern-day country because of a dispute between the broth- ers Tengku Abdul Rahman and Tengku Hussein. Its control by Stamford Raffles was strengthened by the Anglo- Dutch Treaty of 1824. In February 1942, it was taken over by the Japanese, who killed Chinese residents in the Sook Ching Massacre. A major part of the Straits Settlement under the British Crown, this nation gained self-governance under Lim Yew Hock in the 1950s and later complete independence under Lee Kuan Yew. Because its Chinese popu- lation caused racial tensions, this country was kicked out of Malaysia in 1965. Identify this small island nation.

This person was accused of breaking the asiento provision of the Treaty of Utrecht, which limited the slave trade with Spanish colonies. He is responsible for encouraging the fighting that led to King George's War, giving a dramatic speech to the House of Commons in 1738, seven years after he was supposed to speak to King George the Second. While returning to England from Jamaica, his ship was pulled over by the San Antonio, a Spanish Coast Guard ship also known as the Isabela. While tied to the mast of his own ship, the Rebecca, he had a body part cut off. Name this sailor who carried around a pickled jar that contained his ear.

This work might be based on words spoken to Nikolaus Madruz, and its narrator says that he chooses never to stoop. This poem ends with a reference to a bronze statue by Claus of Innsbruck which shows Neptune taming a sea horse. It discusses the joy brought by a white mule or a bough of cherries, which upsets the narrator when those gifts are put on a par with a nine-hundred-years-old name. This work begins with a reference to a painting supposedly by Fra Pandolf, which shows the former wife of the narrator, the Duke of Ferrara. Identify this poem by Robert Brown- ing.

answer: Hector {Berlioz}

One work by this composer is supposed to end with March for the Presentation of the Colours, but because that part often is omitted, it ends with Judex crederis, which is called both a hymn and a prayer. Another work, a requiem he was not paid for until he threatened to spread a rumor about the French government, is his Grande Messe des morts. The first symphony by this composer, whose sequel is known as Lélio, has its last three of five sections titled Scene in the Country, March to the Scaffold, and Dream of a Witches' Sabbath.
