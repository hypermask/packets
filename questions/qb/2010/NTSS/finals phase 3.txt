answer: {groups}

One type of these objects consists of all finite words built from a set; that is the free variety. They are partitioned by their orbits under an action, and these mathematical structures can be represented by Cayley graphs or Cayley ta- bles. The types of these objects that represent the symmetries of a regular polygon are known as dihedral ones, and those that can be generated by products of a single element are called cyclic. If they are commutative, they are known as abelian. Name these mathematical structures that consist of a set closed under a binary operation that is associative and possesses inverses and an identity.

answer: {thalamus} [do not accept “{hypothalamus}”]

Lesions in this structure can cause hemiballism, resulting in the most violent type of involuntary limb movement. In humans, this structure is the largest in the diencephalon and its two halves sit on each side of the third ventricle. The somesthetic nuclei connect this structure to the midbrain, and by linking the cerebellum to the frontal lobe, it permits voluntary motor control. Blocking stimulus signals during sleep, name this “sensory switchboard” of the brain that relays information on sight, sound, touch, and pain from the sense organs to the cerebral cortex.

answer: Battle of {Manila} Bay [do not accept “{Manila}”]

Intelligence for this battle was provided by Oscar Williams, and one of its causes was that Secretary of the Navy John Long left work early one day, leaving his assistant in charge.

US ships, which had been commanded to prepare for battle by Teddy Roosevelt, sailed from Hong Kong and entered battle through Boca Grande south of Corregidor. Name this first major battle of the Spanish-American War, a major victory for Admiral Dewey.

One of the two parts of these lens types traditionally contained a lot of lead oxide, but it now usually contains titanium dioxide or zirconium dioxide in an effort to lower the Abbe number. In addition to that diverging flint glass, there is often fluorite or lanthunum in the converging crown glass to lower dispersion. Name this type of lens designed to reduce fringing and false color by bringing two wavelengths, usually red and blue, to the same focus point.

answer: Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp {Cantor}

This mathematician proposed a problem which became the first of Hilbert's problems and is known as the con- tinuum hypothesis. This mathematician developed the concept of numbers that are larger than all finite numbers but not necessarily infinite, which he called transfinite numbers; and his eponymous fractal is created by taking the closed interval zero, one and repeatedly deleting open middle thirds. This mathematician attempted to write every number in its binary representation but derived a contradiction to show that the set of reals is uncountable—his namesake di- agonal argument. Name this German founder of set theory.

answer: {ductility} [accept word forms, {e.g. ductile}]

Neutron irradiation decreases this property in crystals, where it is more pronounced in face-centered cubic struc- tures than in body-centered ones. In alloys, this property is inversely related to carbon content, while the process of ni- triding hardens steel without diminishing this property. In general, heating enhances this property, which is measured in terms of strain or reduction in area. This property is low in lead despite that metal being very malleable, and tests for this property in metals often cause necking, which refers to the shape produced when stretching the material to its breaking or tensile point. Sometimes described as the opposite of brittleness, name this physical property which allows a substance like aluminum or copper to be drawn out into a thin wire.
