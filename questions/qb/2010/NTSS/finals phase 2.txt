answer: {thermite} reaction [or {thermit} reaction]

One version of this reaction, the Ames process, was used to purify uranium during the Manhattan Project, while the nano- type frequently ends with the reduction of molybdenum-6-plus. A mixture of potassium permanganate and glycerol often provides the activation energy for this reaction, which its discoverer, Hans Goldschmidt, originally used to weld railroad tracks. This reaction is notoriously difficult to smother since its metal oxide reactant yields a constant supply of oxygen, explaining why the U.S. Coast Guard has used this reaction to fragment icebergs. Generating tem- peratures up to 2500 degrees Celsius, name this chemical reaction that in its most common form, combines aluminum powder with rust to produce molten iron.

answer: {transitive} property [accept word forms, {e.g. transitivity} ]

A group action has this property if it is possible to find an element of the group that takes any element of the set to any other. This adjective precedes the word “closure” to describe a graph that contains edges between any two vertices that are connected. Like reflexivity, this property of binary relations is an essential quality to both preorders and par- tially ordered sets. One of the three properties of equivalence relations, it also applies to relations such as implication, set containment, and inequality; the other two properties of equivalence relations are reflexivity and symmetry. Name this property, an example of which is the statement that if x equals y and y equals z, then x equals z.

answer: Battle of {Fredericksburg}

The outcome of this battle probably was determined by a seventeen day wait by Union forces for supplies to build pontoon bridges, allowing Confederate forces to set up artillery at points such as Telegraph Hill and Howison Hill. Union attacks such as the one led by Edwin Sumner and William Franklin were easily turned back by troops under James Longstreet and Stonewall Jackson. The Union plan to advance on Richmond was halted at this battle on the Rappahannock River, harming the reputation of General Ambrose Burnside. Name this battle that lasted five days in December, 1862.

answer: {electroweak unification} [accept other words after “electroweak”, accept answers describing a combination

This accomplishment was calculated by crossing a special unitary group with determinant two with the first uni- tary group. Its first major confirmation was the discovery of neutral currents in experiments involving neutrinos at CERN in 1974, which led to Nobel Prizes being awarded to Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg. It was further con- firmed by the discovery of the W and Z bosons. Widely considered the biggest success of the Standard Model, re- search is still being conducted to discover why those bosons have mass but photons do not, and how spontaneous symmetry breaking took place as the universe cooled after the Big Bang. Name this achievement that physicists hope will one day be expanded to include the strong nuclear and gravitational forces.

answer: “Ode to a {Nightingale}”

The narrator of this poem admits that many times he has “been half in love with easeful Death” and is jealous of a creature that has “never known the weariness, the fever, and the fret.” He also connects himself to sailors listening through casements, Ruth, and emperors and clowns because they hear the same sound, and he later wonders whether “it was a vision or a waking dream.” This poem begins, “My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains my sense,” and it tells its subject that it “wast not born for death.” Name this work by John Keats addressed to an “immortal bird.”

answer: {Poisson} distribution [accept {Poisson processes}]

Inter-event times for this distribution follow the exponential distribution, and its moment-generating function is proportional to e to the t, quantity minus one. The sum of variables with this distribution itself follows this distribu- tion; that result is its reproductive property. This distribution applies when the question of how many events have not occurred has no meaning, and when the product of the number of trials with the probability remains fixed as the number of trials goes to infinity, it approximates the binomial distribution; that approximation is good for many trials with small probability of success. Its mean and variance are both equal to its single parameter, and its mass function at x for a parameter mu is e to the minus mu times mu to the x, over x factorial. Name this distribution used to model waiting times for arrivals, named for a Frenchman.

The first test of this two-nation alliance was the First Moroccan Crisis. It originated with three documents, in- cluding one dealing with Newfoundland and another with Siam. The primary document that set this alliance con- tained nine public and five secret articles focused on Morocco and Egypt and, to a lesser extent, the role of Spain, which enjoyed positive relations with both of the nations that joined it. This agreement followed state visits by Emile Loubet and Edward VII to each other's countries and, once the Anglo-Russian Entente was completed, it formed a role in defeating the Triple Alliance in World War I.

Another love interest of the protago- nist is a puppet created by Spalanzani; that puppet must be constantly wound up over the course of the “Doll's Song”. In addition to Giulietta and Olympia, the protagonist loves a frail singer, Antonia; recalling those three lost loves con- vinces the very drunk protagonist that he does not love the prima donna Stella. Featuring a Jules Barbier libretto in- spired by short stories such as “Der Sandmann”, name this opera “starring” the author of The Nutcracker, composed by Jacques Offenbach.

answer: endospores [prompt on {spores}]

The discovery of these cells by Ferdinand Cohn helped disprove the theory of spontaneous generation, and, unlike cysts, these cells form internally rather than grow on the cell wall. Those produced by the genus Clostridium contrib- ute to the severest form of food poisoning, while biowarfare with anthrax requires the airborne disperal of these cells. Able to remain dormant for centuries, and resistant to UV rays, dessication, high temperature, and chemical disinfec- tants, identify these thick-coated bacterial cells that can survive long exposure to harsh environments.

The sixth and final one of these essays distinguishes between understanding and imagination and proves the exis- tence of material things based on the fact that God is no deceiver. The third essay in this collection argues for the exis- tence of God because it is the only possible creator of myself. Its second essay states that the only three possible ways to understand wax are by sense, imagination, or mind alone before eliminating sense and imagination as possibilities. That essay also answers the question as to what kind of thing the writer is with the answer “a thinking thing”.

answer: {Cambrian} period

The beginning of this period is marked by the appearance of Treptichnus pedum trace fossils, and the Hawke Bay event signaled an abrupt drop in global sea level in the middle of this period. The Phanerozoic eon began in this pe- riod, whose rocks were first classified by Adam Sedgwick. This period is known for its rich abundance of lagerstatten, with brachiopods as the second most prevalent fossil type, though the best record of this period's fauna is found in British Columbia's Burgess Shale. Having the trilobite as its characteristic fossil, name this period, the first in the Pa- leozoic era, when at least eleven of the present animal phyla evolved in a namesake “explosion”.
