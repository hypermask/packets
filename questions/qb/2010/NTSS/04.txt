answer: {Uganda}

The first postcolonial President of this country was Mutesa II thanks to its monarchist party Kabaka Yekka, but he was exiled to Britain a few years after Britain granted this nation its independence. The next President wrote a Social- ist pamphlet titled The Common Man's Charter, and his order to arrest the Army Chief led to a coup when that Presi- dent was in Singapore. The next leader of this country expelled most Asians, declared himself Conqueror of the Brit- ish Empire, allowed Palestinian hijackers to use Entebbe (en-TEB-bee) Airport, and attempted to invade Tanzania (tan-za-NEE-uh). Eventually, Yoweri Museveni (moo-say-VEH-nee) brought stability to this country. Name this East African nation that has been ruled by Milton Obote (o-BOA-tay) and Idi Amin (EE-dee ah-MEEN) whose capital is Kampala.

Name this religious translation of Hebrew and Greek texts into English made after the death of Queen Elizabeth.

answer: {interquartile} range [or {IQR}; do not accept or prompt on “{range}”]

When a sample size equals one mod four, this value is equal to the H-Spread, or the difference between the hinges. In a normal distribution, this value is supposed to equal approximately 1.35 times the standard deviation, covering about two-thirds of a standard deviation both above and below the mean, and, like the median absolute deviation, this statistic is robust. This value is represented as the width of the box in a boxplot. Name this statistic which is calculated by subtracting the the median of the lower half of a data set from the median of the upper half.

answer: {Aufbau} principle [accept {building}-{up principle} before it is mentioned]

Due to violations of special relativity, this concept fails around atomic number 173. In 1990, the IUPAC changed the numbering of groups to better reflect this concept, which explains the increased shielding of nuclear charge across a period. Madelung's (mah-DEH-loongz) rule determines order in this concept, while copper and chromium are no- table exceptions to it, since both lack full s orbitals in their electron configurations. Forcing three-d orbitals to be filled after four-s orbitals, name this principle whose name comes from the German for “building up”, and which requires electrons to enter atomic orbitals in a pattern that minimizes the total potential energy.

The Center for Security Policy calls this doctrine “the Threat To America”, and it is the goal of three men in Eng- land who burned poppies during the Armistice Day silence. Newt Gingrich called for a national ban on this system even though it is already banned by the First Amendment, and Nevada Senate candidate Sharron Angle expressed concern that this system is used in Dearborn, Michigan as well as a Texas town that does not exist. Through its Save Our State Law, Oklahoma just became the first state to ban its implementation. Some people, conflating this system with halal, claim it is being imposed in Minnesota because certain cabbies refused to take passengers with alcohol and some supermarket checkers refuse to handle pork. Closely associated with Fiqh and practiced in Saudi Arabia, name this Islamic legal system.

This musical begins with a chant of “Dixit Dominus” by the same characters who later ask, “How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?” In this work, Elsa Schräder and Max Detweiler are surprised by a game of leapfrog, and a group of children are comforted by yodel- ing through “The Goatherd Song” or listing “My Favorite Things”.

answer: The Four {Seasons} [or Le quattro stagioni]

These pieces inspired Philip Glass' Violin Concerto Number Two, and the first recording of these works was made by Bernardino Molinari. The second of these pieces begins Allegro non molto and is catalogued as RV 315. These works caused Francesco Geminiani (fran-CHES-co je-MEE-nee-ah-nee) to complain, “Imitating the Cock, Cuckoo, Owl and other birds” were “Tricks that rather belong to the Professors of Legerdemain and Posture-makers than to the art of Music.” Notes from the composer in this piece include “the drunkards have fallen asleep” during the second movement of the third concerto. Originally one-third of The Contest Between Harmony and Invention, name these four concertos often paired with four sonnets by Antonio Vivaldi.

answer: {tides} [or {tidal currents}, etc.]

Internal friction generated by this phenomenon is thought to be the cause of Io's intense volcanic activity, and this phenomenon does not exist at amphidromic (aam-fih-DROH-mik) points. Before it was dredged, the River Seine had a noted mascaret (maas-kuh-RAY) or bore that was driven by these events, and slack water is the time when these ef- fects are not active. The largest range of one of these events, sixteen meters, was measured in Canada's Bay of Fundy, and the phases of the Moon align with the maximum and minimum of these events, known as spring and neap, respec- tively. Occurring twice each day along most of the world's coastlines, name this periodic rise and fall in sea level due to gravitational effects of the Sun and Moon.

Charles Darwin studied this phenomenon in oat coleoptiles (koh-lee-OP-tils), and Frits Went used agar blocks to determine that it was not the result of electrochemical impulses. Explained by the acid growth hypothesis, this process begins when indoleacetic (in-dohl-uh-SEE-tihk) acid lowers the pH (“P H”) of cell walls, allowing turgor pressure and expansin enzymes to elongate cells. Occurring only in response to wavelengths under 500 nanometers, name this type of growth in which auxin stimulates a plant to bend toward a light source.

This poet also said it is “a precious, mouldering pleasure…to meet an antique book” and said that no frigate is “like a book to take us lands away.” One work by this poet begins, “If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain.” This poet also claimed to “pause before a house that seemed a swelling of the ground” while on a carriage ride with immortality and death.

answer: radians

This unit must be used for one of the quantities so that the small oscillation restoring force of a pendulum can be approximated as mass times little g times theta. This unit also must be used for the common Taylor series approxima- tion x minus x cubed over six plus x to the fifth over one hundred twenty, etcetera. One way to define this unit is arc length divided by radius, which is why numbers measured in these units can be multiplied by numbers in other units without changing those other units. This unit can be thought of as the number of radii that would fit along the arc in- scribed in an angle, and it equals approximately 57.3 degrees. Give this unit that can be converted to by multiplying pi over one hundred eighty times the number of degrees.

Name this President who began the Great Society programs and escalated the Vietnam War after being sworn in upon the assassination of President Kennedy.
