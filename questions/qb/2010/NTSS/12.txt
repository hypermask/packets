answer: {greatest} common {factor} [or {greatest} common {divisor}; or {GCF}; or {GCD}]

The existence of this function for two elements of a ring ensures that the ring is a principal ideal domain. This value can be found by beginning a sequence with the two given numbers with the larger one first and repeatedly adding to the sequence with the difference between the second to last number and the largest multiple of the last number that will leave a positive result. That process is known as the Euclidean algorithm, and if this value is one for two numbers, then the numbers are said to be relatively prime. It can also be calculated by dividing the product of two numbers by their least common multiple. Given the prime factorization of two numbers, this value can be found by multiplying together the set of their common prime factors. Name this value which is the largest value that divides two numbers.

answer: volume

In the Diesel cycle, this value is held constant during cooling, which means that step is classified as isochoric. In an isobaric process, pressure is multiplied by the change in this quantity to calculate work. A common form of the Van der Waals equation subtracts n times b from this quantity, and, to calculate enthalpy, this quantity typically is multi- plied by pressure. According to both the Ideal Gas Law and Boyle's Law, this quantity varies inversely with pressure when temperature and number of moles is held constant. Name this quantity equal to mass divided by density that typically is measured in some form of cubic units.

One type of this procedure is a triply-eponymous method that counts how many times somebody from a stronger sample beats somebody from a weaker sample, quantified as capital U. In addition to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney type, the Wald type of this procedure determines whether or not a parameter exists, and the Yates type corrects the Pearson chi-square type, which, like the type that uses the Student's t-distribution, requires finding the degrees of freedom to calculate the p-value necessary to reject the null hypothesis. Give the name common to these procedures which determine whether or not a result is statistically significant.
