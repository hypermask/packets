answer: {fullerene} [accept {buckminsterfullerenes}; prompt on {buckyball}, {nanotube}, or {buckytube} before {men}-

Methano-examples of these molecules are synthesized in the Bingel reaction, and this class of molecules was first discovered in experiments simulating the atmosphere of red giants. The electrodes of paper batteries are built from another molecule in this class, which can also be used to construct cables with one hundred times the tensile strength of steel. When joined with alkali metals, molecules in this class formed the first superconductors to function above nineteen kelvins, and this class is considered the third allotrope of carbon along with diamond and graphite. Named for the designer of the geodesic dome, identify this class of large carbon molecules that includes the buckyball and nanotube.

answer: {ectothermic} [or {poikilothermic}; accept {cold}-{blooded}, but {inform players} that they {properly should use}

Scientists debate whether the extinct goat Myotragus balearicus had this property, which is often associated with lammellar-zonal bone. Animals with this property generally have Q-ten values greater than one, and their energy ex- penditure is calculated in terms of standard metabolic rate. Many animals of this type generate cryoprotectants in cold regions, and pupfish are an unusual example of this property because they use desert hotsprings to maintain a consis- tent environment. Inward blood circulation in marine iguanas and basking in alligators are two adaptations to this property seen in reptiles. Identify this property, characteristic of fish and amphibians, which requires certain animals to absorb heat from their surroundings in order to regulate body temperature.

answer: Franz Peter {Schubert}

Just before dying, this composer completed his only string quintet, which is in C major and uses two cellos and only one viola. After he died, a posthumously published collection was appropriately titled Swansong. This composer's sixth symphony is nicknamed “Little C major” to contrast with a later symphony also written in C major. Another sym- phony by this composer has a clarinet solo passing to the oboe in the second movement, written in E major, while the first movement is in B minor. A quintet by this composer published in 1829, soon after his death, uses a piano and a double bass but only one violin and is nicknamed the “Trout Quintet”. Name this composer whose most famous sym- phony only has two completed movements, which is why it is nicknamed “Unfinished”.

answer: {arithmetic} (aa-rith-MAA-tik, but be lenient) sequence [or {arithmetic progression}; prompt on {sequence}]

When these structures have three consecutive perfect squares, they use a multiple of twenty-four, and a proof has been submitted that these structures cannot have four consecutive perfect squares. In 2004, Ben Green and Terrence Tao proved that there exist arbitrarily long lists of prime numbers that are this type of structure. These structures can be thought of as linear functions from the natural numbers to the real numbers or complex numbers. By pairing up entries from these structures, Gauss famously found a fast method to sum them when he was young. Examples in- clude the numbers equal to two mod five, even numbers, odd numbers, and the multiples of any integers, but not the Fibonacci numbers or the powers of two. Give the name of this type of sequence whose general form is given by a sub n equals a sub one plus d times the quantity n minus one.

answer: {gamma} rays/radiation [prompt on {electromagnetic radiation}; prompt on {EM radiation}]

The resonant absorption of this type of radiation by solids, but not gases, is explained by the Mössbauer effect, and the gravitational shift observed in this kind of radiation was the basis for the Pound-Rebka experiment. When produced by cobalt-sixty, this is commonly used to change the color of gemstones. This radiation was discovered by Paul Villard's experiment in which a photographic plate developed despite being separated from radium salts by a magnetic field and a lead shield. Having the shortest known wavelengths in nature, identify this type of radiation la- beled by Ernest Rutherford after he had named alpha and beta.

answer: {cross} product [or {Gibbs} vector product; prompt on {vector product}]

This operation is combined with the del operator to find the limiting value of circulation per unit area for certain fields; that is the curl operation. This operation is used to find binormal vectors, the intersection of two planes, and the area of a parallelogram. Often found by taking a three-by-three determinant, the result of this operation is per- pendicular to the two input vectors, and its direction can be determined using the right hand rule. Name this vector operation whose result is equal in magnitude to the product of the magnitude of the two vectors times the sine of the angle between them, and that in the scalar triple product is combined with the dot product.

answer: Robert {Hooke}

This scientist assisted Robert Boyle to design an air pump to study the nature of the atmosphere. Like Leibniz, this scientist fought with Isaac Newton; his feud concerned who discovered that gravity follows an inverse-square law. Before building the first practical Gregorian telescope, he drew snowflake crystals and the eyes of flies in his book Mi- crographia. This scientist named one of his most famous discoveries after the rooms in which monks lived based on his observations of cork. Name this discoverer of biological cells and a namesake law of elasticity which states that for cer- tain materials, a restoring force is proportional in magnitude to the displacement from equilibrium.
