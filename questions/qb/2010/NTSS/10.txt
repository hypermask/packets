answer: time

One of the impacts on this quantity by general relativity theory is named after Irwin Shapiro. Two common forms of the Schrödinger equation are classified by whether or not they are dependent on this quantity, and reversing this quantity has no impact in electric fields but reverses magnetic fields. In classical mechanics, impulse is calculated by in- tegrating force with respect to this quantity, and acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to this quantity. In special relativity theory, this quantity is dilated and is sometimes treated as a “fourth dimension”. Name this quan- tity, the reciprocal of frequency, that is measured by atomic clocks.

Tritium is pro- duced by bombarding this element's second most abundant isotope with neutrons, and three-volt batteries typically use this metal as the anode. Also used as a treatment for bipolar disorder, name this alkali metal with atomic number three and symbol Li.

answer: {X chromosomes} [prompt on {sex chromosomes}; do not accept or prompt on “Barr body”]

Despite its length, this structure is listed second-to-last in the Denver system, and in mammals it is prone to lyonization. A common form of mental retardation is caused by the fragile syndrome of this structure, and T. H. Morgan discovered that the gene for white eyes in fruit flies is carried on this chromosome. Unlike other trisomies, possessing three of this structure can still result in a normal phenotype, while tortoiseshell cats are produced when one of these structures condenses into a Barr body. Responsible for the inheritance of sex-linked disorders such as hemo- philia and colorblindness, name this chromosome, two of which appear in the genotype of a normal human female.

In a circle, this distance equals the radius minus the sagitta of a chord, which equals the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of that chord. For other shapes, this equals the side length divided by twice the tangent of the quantity pi over n, where n is the number of sides, so, for example, it equals the side length times root three over two for a regular hexagon. For any regular polygon, this distance is twice the area divided by the perimeter. Contrasted with the radius of a polygon, name this distance, or segment, from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of one of its edges.
