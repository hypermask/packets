The servants of this goddess, who moved so slowly that they always appeared to be still, are Ganglati and Ganglot. This goddess used a knife called Famine and a plate called Hunger, and she was the youngest offspring of Angrboda (AHN-gur-BOH-dah) and Loki (LOH-kee) after Fenrir and Jörmungandr (YOR-mun-gahn-dur). After Odin kicked this goddess out of Asgard, she built her house Eljudnir in Niflheim (NIH-ful-haim). Because Thökk did not cry, this woman kept possession of Balder after he died.

answer: {deposition}

An exotic energy form of this process is used to manufacture ceramic powders, and it is the easiest method for vitri- fying water. It is also the preferred means of creating high-purity chalcogenide (KAL-kuh-juh-nid) glass, and syn- thetic diamonds can be made by the chemical-vapor type of this process. More common examples of this process in- clude the formation of snow in clouds and frost on windows. The reverse of sublimation, identify this process in which a gas changes directly into a solid without first becoming a liquid.

answer: {Jay's} Treaty [or Treaty of {Amity}, {Commerce}, and {Navigation}]

This agreement set up a commission to identify what was meant by the Saint Croix River, deciding that a previous agreement should have named the Schoodiac River. An article added to this agreement opposed its limit on trade in the West Indies. After a leak by Senator Stevens Mason, this treaty became unpopular, and the House threatened not to fund it, but it passed by a single Senate vote. Debts were sent to arbitration, the United States agreed to limit cot- ton exports, and Britain agreed to withdraw from the Northwest Territories. Name this treaty whose namesake, who was burned in effigy throughout the United States, was the first Supreme Court Chief Justice.

answer: {square matrices} [or {matrix}; accept {linear transformations} before they are mentioned; prompt on {trans}-

The Cayley-Hamilton theorem applies to these entities when they are part of an abelian (uh-BEE-lee-un) group, stating that each one satisfies its own characteristic equation. That characteristic equation is used to find scalars which multiply certain vectors to give the same result as multiplying by these entities; those scalars are called eigenvalues. Transition ones of these entities are used in Markov chains, and Gauss-Jordan elimination can be applied to these structures to convert them into reduced row-echelon form. An adjoint of one of these equals its inverse times its de- terminant. Name these mathematical structures that usually consist of rectangular arrays of numbers.

answer: oncogenes [prompt on {cancer} gene; do not accept “{proto}-oncogene”]

J. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus first identified these genes in chicken retroviruses; the first to be isolated is called src (“S R C”). “Anti-” examples of these include BRCA1 and p53, while normal forms of them often code for kinase enzymes involved in the signal transduction pathways of the cell cycle. They are grouped in families like myc (MIHK), mas (“mass”), and ras (RAAS), the latter being active in twenty-five percent of human carcinomas. Arising from amplification or mutations in their proto- forms, identify these genes that transform normal cells into tumor cells.

This phenomenon occurs in certain circuits when the parallel admittance is minimized, or when omega times in- ductance is the reciprocal of omega times capacitance. This phenomenon is used to keep time using quartz clocks, and its nameaske frequency for a spring with spring constant k attached to a mass m is root k over m. A famous example of this phenomenon destroyed the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge; it is caused when a driving force matches an oscillating body's frequency, such as in a playground swing. Name this phenomenon that occurs when an object vibrates at its natural frequency, a term which provides the “R” in the medical abbreviation MRI.

When this function is applied to the natural logarithm of the golden mean it returns one half. The derivative of this function's inverse is the reciprocal of the square root of the quantity x squared plus one, and any solution with ini- tial condition y equals zero to the differential equation of y double-prime equals y must be a multiple of this function. For small values of x, this function can be approximated by x plus x cubed over six. This function itself is given by the formula one half times the quantity e to the x, minus e to the negative x. Name this function that, when it is inputted half of the area confined by the x-axis, the right half of the curve x squared minus y squared equals one, and a segment connecting the origin to that curve, returns the y-coordinate of the point of intersection.

Search ones of these facilitate range queries, while ones used in database engines have a very high fan-out of around 200. One type of them can achieve amortized O(log n) [“big O of log n”] lookup; that is the self-balancing search variety, while classical examples of these structures are typically binary. For arbitrary graphs, Prim's Algorithm finds the minimum spanning one of these structures. Any connected graph with a unique path between any two verti- ces is this type of graph. Name this type of recursive data structure in which the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices, because they have no cycles.
