answer: {HPV} [or {human papilloma virus;} prompt on papillomavirus]

This pathogen leads to an increase in protein p16 but inactivates it. Research on this pathogen led to the 2008 No- bel Prize in Medicine for Harald zur Hausen and two of its more than one hundred types cause flat warts on the hands and plantar warts on the feet. Genes E6/E7 of types sixteen and eighteen of this virus promote deadly tumor growth in infected epithelial tissue. The vaccines against it are called quadrivalent because they protect against four types of this virus, which is considered by the CDC to be the most common sexually transmitted disease. Name this virus targeted by the vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix which causes cervical cancer.

answer: {natural logarithm} of x [or {logarithm} (to the {base e}); accept {ln}; accept {lg}]

The polar equation theta equals this function of r produces a spira mirabilis, or golden spiral. The nth term of this function's Maclaurin series equals the quantity x minus one, quantity to the nth power, over n. This function can be in- tegrated by multiplying it by x and subtracting x, and its derivative equals the reciprocal of x. Multiplying two num- bers together and then applying this function has the same result as applying this function separately to the two num- bers and adding the results, and exponents inside these functions can instead be used to multiply outside of them. This function can be transformed to other bases by dividing it by itself applied to a constant, and its discovery is often credited to John Napier. Name this inverse of the exponential function.

The Parkes process relies on this property to extract silver from lead, and iron sulfide is the main component of this type of magma. This property of the liquid phase of heteroazeotropes (HEH-tuh-roh-AY-zee-oh-trohps) allows for their continuous distillation, and partition coefficients in chromatography are determined by this property of octanol. This property also prevents the formation of a copper-cobalt alloy. In general, mixtures with this property have very large, positive enthalpies of solution, while emulsifiers like lecithin (LEH-sih-thin) help overcome this property in foods such as salad dressing. Most obvious in a mixture of oil and water, identify this physical property in which two liquids are unable to dissolve in one another.

Though the composer of these pieces often played viola, he switched to harpsichord for the fifth one and gave the harpsichord a bigger part in that piece. The final one of these pieces has no violins but a part for the viola da gamba, the closest thing to a cello at the time, that probably was played by Prince Leopold. The second of these pieces gives a major but difficult role to the tromba, which is replaced by a trumpet in modern recordings. These pieces were given for free to the Margrave Christian Ludwig, though it is believed that the composer wrote them for his musicians at Coethen. These are all in major keys, the first two in F, the next two in G, the fifth in D, and the sixth and final one in B Flat. Name these Baroque compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach.

This thinker wrote, “Treat social facts as things.” This writer asked what a social fact is in his plan to turn sociol- ogy into a science titled Rules of the Sociological Method. He explained how to return social norms in his work Moral Education and began using a term referring to unclear social norms in his first book The Division of Labour in Society. This writer's best known work classified a particular phenomenon four different ways based on levels of social integra- tion and moral regulation. Those four classifications are egoistic, altruistic, fatalistic, and anomic. Identify this French sociologist who wrote Suicide.

answer: {Coriolis} effect/force

An imbalance between the cause of this phenomenon and pressure gradients causes non-dispersive waves called Kelvin waves, and it is used to find mass flow rates by comparing the twists in vibrating tubes. With the conservation of angular momentum, this concept is used to explain the precession of Foucault (foo-KOH) pendulums. An appar- ent acceleration of two times angular velocity cross linear velocity, this concept shows up as the sum of two terms when one takes the second time-derivative of the position of a person walking outward on a moving merry-go-round. Name this effect in which objects appear to deflect from straight lines when viewed from a rotating reference frame.

answer: {icosahedron}

The dihedral angles in this solid have an angle equal to the arccosine of negative root five over three, which is about 138 degrees. All of its vertices can be sorted into groups of four that form golden rectangles. One of these solids with side length two can be placed in rectangular coordinates so that each point has one coordinate equal to zero, one coordinate equal to plus or minus one, and one coordinate equal to the golden ratio. It contains thirty edges and twelve vertices, and each vertex brings together five triangles. Name this platonic solid, the dual of the dodecahedron, whose name is derived from the Greek for twenty because it has twenty sides.

The Wieland-Miescher (VEE-lahnd MEE-shur) and Hajos-Parrish (HI-yuss PAAR-ish) examples of these compounds are products of the Robinson annulation, and another member of this class, the main ingredient in artifi- cial butter flavoring, is diacetyl (di-uh-SEE-tuhl). In the presence of mercuric sulfate, alkynes (AL-kines) can be con- verted to these compounds by hydration, and though this class is not lipids (LIH-pids), it does include animal musk and the androgen steroid hormones. Common solvents in this class include the wax precipitating methyl ethyl (METH-uhl ETH-uhl) type along with the primary component of nail polish remover, and a negative result from Tollens' reagent distinguishes this class from aldehydes (AL-duh-hidz). Easily produced by oxidation of secondary al- cohols, name this class of compounds in which a carbonyl (car-BON-uhl) group is bonded to two other carbons.
