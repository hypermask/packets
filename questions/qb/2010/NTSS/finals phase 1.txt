answer: Wallace {Stevens}

In one work, this writer knows to often ask “Whose spirit is this?” as a group listens to a woman sing by the sea. Another poem by this writer ends with “an old sailor, drunk and asleep in his boots” dreaming of “tigers in red weather” in an area where all of the nightgowns are white rather than strange. Another work by this poet claims, “I was of three minds.” That work also states that a man and a woman and the type of bird mentioned in the poem's title are one. Another poem by this man is set at a festive wake and begins, “Call the roller of big cigars.” Identify this poet who wrote “The Idea of Order at Key West”, “Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock”, “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird”, and “The Emperor of Ice-Cream”.

answer: George Gabriel {Stokes}

This person was the first scientist to use what later became known as Reynolds numbers, which he called an index of friction. When the Reynolds number is low, this person's name is combined with Einstein's to describe the diffu- sion rate and to describe the size of a sphere that diffuses at the same rate as a molecule. The law named after this per- son states that in limiting cases you can multiply six pi times velocity times the approximating sphere radius times vis- cosity to find the drag force on an object, and his eponymous mathematical theorem generalizes the theorems of Gauss and Green. Name this scientist who in 1845 published a new derivation of the equation describing fluid mo- tion, forever linking his name with that of Claude-Louis Navier.

answer: {lemniscate} of Bernoulli [prompt {Cassini oval}]

This shape is the cissoid of a single circle using a point located root two times the radius from the center, and it is the inversion of a hyperbola. This shape also is the envelope of circles centered on a hyperbola and passing through the center of that hyperbola, and it also is the locus of points such that the product of the distances to two fixed points is constant. A specific case of a Cassini oval, this shape can be expressed in polar form as r squared equals a squared times the cosine of two theta. It is the shape of the slice of a torus if the slice has a point in the center. Name this shape which looks like a figure eight or an infinity sign.

answer: {amorphous} solid/substance [accept {noncrystalline} solid/substance before “{crystalline}”]

The radial distribution functions for these substances lack sharp peaks at large distances, and metallic examples can be made via the splat technique. W. H. Zachariasen first diagrammed the random-network model of these substances that are often produced by laser glazing, melt spinning, or another rapid-quench method. Beryllium diflouride can be- come a rare ionic example of one of these solids, and the thin films in solar cells consist of silicon in this form. Showing no long-range order at the atomic level, identify this term for solids like polystyrene and window glass that do not have a crystalline lattice structure.

answer: {Imams}

In Yemen, many people believe that the fifth person to hold this title was Zayd ibn Ali rather than his brother Muhammad al-Baqir, and it used to be common to use this title to denote the leader of Yemen. This title generally takes less importance in Sunni as opposed to Shi'a Islam, but one of its Sunni uses is for the founders of the four madhhabs. In Shi'a Islam, where the Umayyad Caliphs were not recognized, this group of people is considered infalli- ble, starting with the Commander of the Faithful and ending with al-Mahdi, who will return with Jesus. Give this Is- lamic term which can also be used for a prayer leader.

answer: quasar [accept quasi-stellar radio source]

Halton Arp tried unsuccessfully to prove that these objects could be connected by gaseous bridges, and they are distinguished from BL Lac objects because their continuum spectra show unusual emission lines, which were first ex- plained by Maarten Schmidt. These objects reached their peak population in the universe about ten billion years ago, and the first to be discovered was 3C 273, located in the constellation Virgo. These objects operate under the same mechanism as radio galaxies, with their name derived from the fact they are very strong radio sources, though they are now thought to surround the central supermassive black holes of large galaxies. Producing ten to one hundred times more energy than the entire Milky Way in an area the size of our solar system, name these extremely distant objects, the most luminous objects in the universe.

answer: Wassily {Kandinsky}

This artist wrote about an analogy of a moving triangle and the importance of deep blue colors in his written work Concerning the Spiritual in Art. This painter used one name for many of his works that were done quickly, including the 31st one which is nicknamed Sea Battle, and a different name for more planned works, but the first three of those ten planned works were labeled as degenerate by the Nazis and destroyed. This painter's 1912 work Last Judgement was rejected from an exhibition, leading Franz Marc to support him. Several artists joined a movement which took its name from a work by this artist showing a man riding a white horse, The Blue Rider. Name this artist of many Impro- vosations and Compositions, an abstract Russian painter.

answer: {Positivism} [or {Positivist}]

The founder of this philosophy, who initially worked under Henri de Saint-Simon, believed that each branch of science moved through three stages, the first two being theocratic and metaphysical, and the third having the same name as this philosophy. The application of this belief to social sciences was questioned by Wilhelm Dilthey, Heinrich Rickert, and Max Weber based on the importance of symbols and values. The founder of this philosophy proclaimed himself the High Priest of Humanity and devised a calendar with month names such as Moses, Dante, and Gutenberg. This philosophy emphasized observable phenomena and verifiable scientific laws and de-emphasized causation, and its legal branch is associated with utilitarianism and Jeremy Bentham. Name this philosophy associated with Auguste Comte.

This group focused on elections as part of Danny Morrison's Armalite and ballot box strategy. This group's first official leader was Edward Martyn, but it was based on the ideas of Arthur Griffith, who thought Austria-Hungary could be used as a model. In 1970, this group divided into factions nicknamed Gardiner Place and Kevin Street, with the latter eventually taking over. In 1926, this group's leader, Éamon de Valera, left it to found Fianna Fáil. Since 1983, this group has been led by Gerry Adams. Name this group whose name means We Ourselves which is now viewed as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.

answer: {parallel} lines

In hyperbolic geometry there are two forms of this geometric configuration, ultra and limiting. In Euclidean ge- ometry it is the degenerate conic section found by the limiting case as the focal distance goes to infinity while the verti- ces remain constant of a hyperbola. This degenerate conic can also be seen as the intersection of a plane and double cone when the vertex of the cone is moved to a point at infinity making the cone into a cylinder. In projective geome- try, this configuration cannot exist. Solutions in the coordinate plane to the equation y squared equals one provide an algebraic description to this configuration. This configuration also exists in the graph of an inconsistent system of two linear equations--that outcome arises when the two lines have the same slope. Identify this relationship between two lines in the same plane that never intersect.

answer: {Bowman's capsule} [accept {capsula glomeruli} or {glomerular capsule} before “{glomerulus}”]

The coelomic (SEE-loh-mihk) sac, found in the coxal glands of crustaceans, is analogous to this microscopic structure in mammals. It has both vascular and urinary poles, and Bright's disease causes this structure to become blocked with crystals and epithelial cells. Ultrafiltering podocytes in this structure can collect solutes smaller than eight nanometers, explaining the high concentration of salt and sugar in its lumen. The proximal tubule links this structure to the loop of Henle and it forms the renal corpuscle together with the structure it surrounds, the glomeru- lus. Named for a nineteenth-century anatomist, identify this cup-like component of the nephron that first collects the blood filtrate during urine production.
