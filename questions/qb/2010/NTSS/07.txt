The center of that painting shows Jesus and a Latin inscription meaning “Beware, Beware, God Sees” and is surrounded by depictions of the seven sins. This painter's Allegory of Gluttony and Lust used to ap- pear below another work which shows several people, including a nun strumming a lute, trying to eat a piece of meat hanging from a pole in a boat. Another painting by this artist shows a pair of ears with a knife on the right side and God presenting Eve to Adam on the left side.

answer: {ferromagnets} [accept word forms, {e.g. ferromagnetism} or {ferromagnetic}; prompt on {magnets} or word

A pioneering theorist in the study of these materials was Pierre-Ernest Weiss, though explaining them required the understanding of exchange interactions in quantum theory. One phenomenon associated with them can be measured in a Rowland (ROH-lund) ring, and these materials can be described by the spherical or Ising (“icing”) models. The aforementioned effect is often shown as an S-shaped loop and is called hysteresis. These materials are comprised of re- gions with aligned moments that break down above the Curie temperature and are called domains. With examples like cobalt, nickel, and its namesake element, name this phenomenon contrasted with diamagnetism and paramagnet- ism.

answer: {thought experiment} [or {Gedankenexperiment}]

Though it did not concern electromagnetism, this concept was first named by Hans Christian Ørsted (UR-stehd), and a notable example involving quantum entanglement relied on pion decay. One biological application of this con- cept employed a folding funnel to overcome Levinthal's protein conformation paradox, while Freeman Dyson used his namesake sphere to resolve another example in which Earth's energy reserves are exhausted. Isaac Newton's seminal one placed a cannon on a mountaintop to demonstrate that gravity caused planetary motion, and Maxwell's demon and Schrodinger's cat are the most famous ones from thermodynamics and quantum mechanics, respectively. Fre- quently used by Einstein while developing relativity theory, name this form of the scientific method in which a hy- pothesis or principle is tested only in the mind.

answer: Joseph-Maurice Ravel

Based on the poems of Aloysius Bertrand, this composer wrote a collection consisting of Ondine (AHN-deen), Le Gibet, and Scarbo. The rhapsody by this composer contains a Feria and a Malaguena and probably was inspired by his Basque (bask) mother. Those works are Gaspard de la nuit and Spanish rhapsody. Another piece by this composer has a snare drum rhythm and a single theme played louder and louder by different sets of instruments; it was originally a ballet composed for Ida Rubenstein. Name this rival of Claude Debussy (DEH-byoo-see) who composed Bolero.

answer: {conjugate} [accept word forms, {e.g. conjugation}]

This operation often is combined with transposition for matrices, and matrices which do not change under the combined operations are called Hermitian (hur-MI-shun). Performing this operation on a number, multiplying the result by the number itself, and then taking the square root finds the complex modulus of the number, which is also that number's absolute value or norm. When complex numbers are represented as vectors, this operation reflects over the real axis. Simplifying fractions with complex numbers is often accomplished by multiplying by the denominator af- ter this operation has been done. Name this operation which transforms a plus b i to a minus b i.

answer: isomerism

In nuclear chemistry, this term can refer to a metastable nuclide produced by gamma decay, though the more typi- cal form of this concept can also indicate the inertness of complex ions. Alfred Werner employed this concept to re- place chain theory with coordination theory, and ambident ligands are key to explaining the linkage type of this con- cept. Friedrich Woehler provided the first evidence of this concept by comparing ammonium cyanate and urea, while optical activity is the only means of separting enantiomeric examples like L- and D-glyceraldehyde. Also describing re- lationships such as cis versus trans fatty acids and butane versus methylpropane, identify this concept in which two compounds have the same molecular formula but a different arrangement of atoms.

answer: {Daniel} [accept {Belteshazzar} before mentioned]

According to one story, this person found discrepancies when he made two witnesses separately describe a woman committing adultery, saving a woman named either Susanna or Shoshana. Earlier, he asked Arioch (ar-ee-OCK) why a decree was so hasty before conferring with Hananiah (ha-nuh-NAI-uh), Mishael, and Azariah (ah-ZAH-ree-uh), and he was able to claim, “There is a God in heaven that reveals secrets.” Those three friends, also known as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, survived a fiery furnace. This person was originally given the name Belteshazzar, and he de- scribed a creature made of gold, silver, brass, iron, and clay to Nebuchadnezzar. He also interpreted the words menei menei teikel ufarseen at Belshazzar's feast; those words became known as “the writing on the wall”. Identify this name- sake of a Biblical book who was thrown into the lions' den.

answer: totemism

Adolphus Peter Elkin said that Australia was the “ideal laboratory” to study this idea, and Claude Lévi-Strauss compared this belief to hysteria. The first written account of this idea was made by James Long after watching some- body's final bear hunt. Used as the title of a book written before The Golden Bough by James George Frazer, this con- cept was claimed by Sigmund Freud to be the first form of father-surrogate; Freud stated that this belief system pre- vented incest and linked this concept with taboo. Believers of this concept sometimes associate myths with the original ancestor of a clan. This term originally came from the Ojibwe language. Give this term generally associated with sculp- tures depicting family legends of Native Americans, which usually are in the form of poles.

A synthetic form of this substance available over the counter is called menadione (MEH-nuh-di-ohn) and all types of this substance contain a methylated (MEH-thih-lay-tud) naphthoquinone (naaf-thoh-KWI-nohn) ring. Much of the daily requirement of this substance is supplied by E. coli in the large intestine, explaining why newborns often receive an injection of this vitamin.

answer: {modular} arithmetic [or {modulo}; prompt on {clock arithmetic} before it is mentioned; accept word forms

This operation creates equivalence classes based on the ideal of a ring, and can be used to efficiently express Euler's (OY-lurz) Theorem and Fermat's (fair-MAHZ) Little Theorem without using subtraction and divisibility. It also ex- plains why casting out nines can be used to check calculations. Single-bit Boolean algebra is equivalent to this opera- tion using two, and though it is not a type of number base, this operation is a type of arithmetic. Also known as clock arithmetic, this operation involves residue classes and is often written using congruence notation. Name this type of arithmetic based on division remainders.
