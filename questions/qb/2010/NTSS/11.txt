answer: Wilfred {Owen}

The fifth section of one of this writer's poems asks that wise people see their task through the eyes of somebody who is not sad, proud, or curious—the happy people with their “veins run cold” described in its first four sections. Another poem by this man starts by asking, “What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?” In a different poem, the narrator has nightmares about somebody “guttering”, “choking”, and “drowning” after seeing somebody who could not get his mask on fast enough during a gas warfare attack during World War I. That poem claims that a line written by Horace is a lie. Identify this poet who wrote “Insensibility”, “Anthem for Doomed Youth”, and “Dulce (DOOL-say) et Decorum Est”.

answer: {epinephrine} [accept {adrenaline}, prompt on {epi}]

This hormone is distinguished from other catecholamines (caa-tuh-COHL-uh-meenz) by having a methyl (MEH- thihl) group attached to its nitrogen atom. The action of this hormone is diminished by beta-blockers, and though it is not glucagon (GLOO-kuh-gahn), its receptors in the liver work with adenylate cyclase (uh-DEHN-uh-layt SI-klays) to increase the concentration of cyclic AMP, resulting in the conversion of glycogen (GLI-koh-jehn) to glucose. Other effects of this hormone include the relaxation of smooth muscle and an increase in blood pressure, explaining why it is often administered to patients suffering from anaphylaxis (aa-nuh-fuh-LAAK-siss), asthma, and cardiac arrest. Fa- mously mimicked by the herb ephedra (uh-FED-ruh), name this hormone that dilates air passages, contracts blood vessels, and increases heart rate, all as part of the fight-or-flight response.

answer: The {Chrysanthemum} and the {Sword}

In this work, freedom and indulgence is described as a U shape, maximizing for babies and the old. Because a field trip was impossible, research for this book depended on the work of John Embree. This book's writer wanted to study a subject that supposedly had been described by the most fantastic series of “but also's” ever used. Chapters such as “Clearing One's Name”, “Self Discipline”, and “Taking One's Proper Station” were intended to explain a foreign cul- ture that the author's country was at war with, trying to give insight into why its prisoners were not interested in con- tacting family members. Name this work in anthropology published in 1946 that was written by Ruth Benedict about Japan.

answer: {Monte Carlo} algorithm or method [accept {annealing} or {stochastic} before they are mentioned]

One of these methods using Markov chains and sometimes classified as either an independence chain or a random walk is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which is also considered a type of simulated annealing. Often used in sto- chastic modeling, this method was first used to study radiation shielding by John von Neumann and Stanis?aw Ulam. Often used to approximate integrals, this mathematical method is used to study situations such as Brownian motion, economic modeling, and games of chance when deterministic solutions are unknown or unhelpful. Identify this type of solution that repeatedly uses random numbers which is named after a European city.

answer: {leptons}

Physicists believe that these types of particles far outnumbered other types beginning one second after the Big Bang until the universe cooled to one billion Kelvins. In order for the number named after these particles to be con- served, a neutron admits a third particle when it decays in addition to a proton and an electron. Only the most massive type of this particle is capable of emitting a W boson, and one of these particles was formerly believed to be a meson. This family includes the different types of neutrinos and their associated particles, including the tau and the muon. Identify this family of six particles that includes the electron.

This character wonders whether his sister washes herself with a nutmeg grater and tries to eat a breakfast consist- ing largely of diluted milk while being quizzed by his brother-in-law's uncle.

answer: solar {wind} [prompt on {solar flares} before “{flares}”]

The NASA IBEX is now mapping this phenomenon, and scientists believe that the craft observed a reflection of this. Some scientists believe that Earth could not have had an atmosphere until its iron core condensed because of this phenomenon. An unknown mechanism in the polar oval causes this phenomenon to accelerate as it passes through Earth's magnetosphere, and it also forms a solar system-sized bubble in the interstellar medium called the heliosphere. This phenomenon forces the tails of comets to always point away from the Sun, while its periodic flares can cause geomagnetic storms that knock out power grids. Also responsible for the Northern and Southern Lights, name this continuous stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun's corona.

answer: Battle of {Actium}

This battle is named after a town between the Ambracian Gulf and the Ionian Sea.

Alliances were broken immediately before this battle due to one of the generals di- vorcing Octavia. Name this battle in 31 BCE in which Octavian was victorious, leading to the suicides of Mark An- tony and Cleopatra.

answer: {factorial}

This term is used to describe experiments in which at least two factors are tested at all of their possible levels. It more commonly refers to a function which for large values can be estimated by the Stirling approximation. For posi- tive integers, this function shifted to the right by one unit is equal to the gamma function. Most often it is defined re- cursively with the initial value at 0 equaling 1 and the ratio of this function for x divided by this function for the quan- tity x minus one equaling x. This function is often used in combinatorics in the formulas for combinations and permu- tations. Give the name of the function that, for a natural number n, equals the product of all the numbers from 1 to n.

answer: {Stokely Carmichael} [or {Kwame Ture}]

This activist organized the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, which inspired Huey Newton and Bobby Seale to call themselves the Black Panthers.

That briefly held position was followed by a brief association with the Black Panthers, which this man left because he did not want to work with white liberals.

In 1998, he died from prostate cancer after pushing for Pan-Africanism in Guinea. Name this activist who along with Willie Ricks popularized the political slogan Black Power.
