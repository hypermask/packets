answer: {dimensions} [or {dimensionality}; accept {rank}]

For a ring, this quantity is the least upper bound of its prime ideals and is named after Krull. For a vector space, this value equals the cardinality of a basis. Another version of this quantity is given by the quotient of the logarithms of the space-scaling rate and the log of the linear scaling rate; that form of this quantity is named for Felix Hausdorff, and gives non-integer values for fractals. This value is equal to the number of coordinates required to locate a point in a given space, which is why spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems require three values, while polar coordinates re- quire two. Give this value which equals zero for a point and one for a line.

answer: {Cuzco} [or {Qozqo}]

This city probably was started with members of the Marcavalle (mahr-kah-VI-yay) culture, and Brian Bauer is now a leading scholar on its history and its ceque (SAY-kay) system of forty-one imaginary lines. Under rulers in the Hurin and Hanan dynasties such as Sinchi Roca in the thirteenth century, it grew into a kingdom, but this city was conquered in 1533 when General Quisquis (kees-kees) fled and Atahualpa was captured by forces under the com- mand of Francisco Pizarro. Identify this city which during the fifteenth century was built up into the shape of a puma and which probably has been continuously occupied longer than any other in the Western Hemisphere, an Inca capi- tal located in the Andes Mountains in present-day Peru.

answer: {Pioneer}

Early craft in this program were designated Thor-Able and Atlas-Able. Other craft in this progam established a so- called “weather network” in space, which measured cosmic rays and the interplanetary magnetic field. The fourth probe in this program was the first vehicle to make a successful Earth-Moon trajectory, while the sixth probe was the first to analyze the Sun's corona and is still NASA's oldest functioning spacecraft. This program's namesake anomaly concerns the unexpected slowing of distant spacecraft, and its notable achievements include traversing the Asteroid Belt and proving that most gaps in Saturn's rings are not empty. Famous for carrying gold plaques intended to be viewed by extraterrestrials on its spacecraft 10 and 11, name this program that launched the first probes to photo- graph the outer solar system.

answer: {plasmodesmata}

These structures allow companion cells to regulate sieve-tube members in phloem (FLOH-um), and the movement of substances through them is called symplastic transport. These structures occur at densities up to one million per square millimeter in primary pit fields, and they form when the endoplasmic reticulum of a parent cell gets caught in the cell plate during mitosis. Analogous to gap junctions in animal cells, name these cytoplasmic channels that cross adjacent cell walls, allowing the transfer of molecules between plant cells.

answer: Giuseppe Mazzini

This politician wrote a letter to Charles Albert telling him that he had two options, terror, which probably would lead to assassination, or concessions. He later wrote a manifesto saying that great revolutions are the product of prin- ciples rather than bayonets. He broke with his follower Orsini (or-See-nee) before Orsini's assassination attempt against Napoleon the Third. Associated with the motto God and the People, he briefly served with Carlo Armellini (ar-meh-LEE-nee) and Aurelio Saffi as triumvirs of Rome in 1849. Though he became a national hero, he was in jail when Victor Emmanuel the Second captured Rome. Name this radical leader of the secret society Young Italy.

answer: {Cavalleria rusticana} [or {Rustic Chivalry}]

In this opera, the women sing “Gli aranci olezzano sui verdi margini” (lee uh-RAHN-chee o-lay-ZAH-no swee VER-dee mar-JEE-nee) on Easter morning. Based on a short story by Giovanni Verga, much of its backplot is de- scribed in the song “Voi lo sapete”, which means “Now you shall know”. One of this opera's main characters, who sings “Fior di giaggiolo” (gee-AH-juh-low), is Lola. When Lola's fiancée served in the army, she married a teamster named Alfio instead. When that now ex-fiancée, Turiddu, returns, she has an affair with him, which upsets Santuzza. This opera often is performed in combination with Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci (pah-lee-AH-chee). Name this work by Pietro Mascagni (mas-CAH-nyee).

answer: {Federal Reserve} Act [accept {Glass}-{Owen Bill} before it is mentioned]

Some people claimed that this bill was written at the Jekyll Island Club. During debate over this bill, Senator Bris- tow stated, “The Senator from Oklahoma has accepted the most vicious provisions of the Aldrich Plan,” and he added that the Senate's behavior “would have made Alexander Hamilton blush.” This bill's impact was made permanent by the McFadden Act of 1927 and the creation of the FOMC in the 1930s. Sometimes referred to as Glass-Owen, its passage six years after the Panic of 1907 led to debates over how to select the eight to twelve cities it referred to and whether New York City would have a special status within that group, and its supporters claimed that it would stabi- lize the economy. Name this bill that created our current financial system.

answer: particle magnetic {spin} [or {spin} projection quantum number; prompt on {angular momentum} or {rota}-

Scientists at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider are studying how this quantity is manifested in protons because it cannot be accounted for by quarks and gluons. According to the Standard Model, the only particles with a zero value for this quantity are Higgs bosons, and a graviton has the unusual value of two for this quantity. Particles with integer values of this quantity do not need to obey the Pauli exclusion principle and are classified as bosons. For electrons, it is described by fourth quantum number, and groups of particles are considered polarized when this value is in a consis- tent direction. Name this measure of a particle's intrinsic angular momentum.

answer: {Mannerism} [accept word forms]

One example of this school of painting is the Volterra Descent from the Cross altarpiece. Another example of this school is Joseph in Egypt, which lacks a focal point and uses small heads. Those works were painted by Rosso Fioren- tino and Jacopo Pontormo, students of Andrea del Sarto. Other artists associated with this style are Bronzino and El Greco. This early art movement is associated with a movement away from nature and the use of twisted human poses. Name this sixteenth century movement between the Renaissance and Baroque which involved artists developing their own styles by studying other artists.

answer: John {Calvin}

This person broke the knowledge of God down into six parts, ending with the unity of the divine essence, and the knowledge of man into two parts, the second of which is his nature and powers. Two people who helped him were William Farel and Martin Bucer. Over fifty years after he died, this man's followers organized the Canon of Dort, a reaction against the Arminian Remonstrance, which supported doctrines such as irresistible grace, perseverance of the saints, and total depravity. One of this man's students was John Knox, the founder of Presbyterianism. Additionally, his namesake beliefs led to a break with the Church of England by the Puritans who settled the United States. Name this author of Institutes of the Christian Religion who was born in France and became a leader in Geneva, Switzerland.

answer: {zero} product property

This property does not hold in the rings of integers modulo a composite number, and whether it holds distin- guishes integral domains with respect to rings. A short proof by contradiction of this property consists of multiplying both sides of an equation by the multiplicative inverse of any factor on one side of the equation. Often used to find so- lutions to polynomials of degree greater than one, this property makes the solutions obvious once the polynomial has been factored. Name this property that states that if quantities multiply to the additive identity then at least one of the quantities is equal to the additive identity—that is, zero.

answer: {osmosis} [accept word forms; do not accept “{osmotic pressure}”]

In 2009, the first power plant run on the pressure-retarded type of this process opened in Tofte, Norway. Henri Dutrochet built the first meter for measuring this process, and the formation of a silicate precipitate layer allows this process to power the growth of chemical gardens. Another type of this process relies on feed and draw solutions, while the equation pi equals M R T determines the pressure needed to counteract this process. Often reversed to desalinate seawater, identify this process in which water diffuses across a semipermeable (seh-mi-PUR-mee-uh-buhl) membrane before reaching equilibrium.
