answer: {carbon dioxide} [or {CO2}]

This compound is absorbed in the chilled ammonia process, and efforts are now starting to store this in porous sandstone that has been drained of its oil. Commonly used in its supercritical fluid state to decaffeinate coffee, its more common gaseous state is a good atmosphere for welding. When it is important not to leave a chemical residue, this compound is used in fire extinguishers. This compound is combined with water to create glucose and oxygen dur- ing photosynthesis, and it is used to make the fizz in soft drinks. Name this triatomic molecule whose increased con- centration in the atmosphere is believed to be a major cause of global warming.

answer: {event independence} [or {independent} events, etc.]

The Marcinkiewicz–Zygmund (mar-sihn-KEE-vich ZIG-moond) inequality concerns the sum of the variances of variables with this property. The General Poisson (pwah-SOHN) Approximation Theorem holds for events with the asymptotic type of this property, and events can have this property as well as mutual exclusivity only if at least one of them has probability zero. If the covariance, or equivalently the correlation coefficient, of two events is zero, then they have this property; and the multiplication rule in probability applies to any number of events that all have this prop- erty. Formally, events A and B have this property if the probability of A given B equals the probability of A. Name this property of statistical events that means that the outcome of one is unrelated to the outcome of the other.

answer: mesophyll

In C4 plants, the enzyme PEP carboxylase (kar-BAHK-sih-lays) is found in this type of cell, which lies adjacent to the bundle sheath. In most plants, this type of ground tissue is bounded by the upper and lower surfaces of the lam- ina and is divided into regular and loosely arranged cell layers called the palisade and spongy layers, respectively. Ob- taining carbon dioxide through the stomata, name this middle layer of leaf tissue where most photosynthesis in a plant occurs.

answer: {meteor shower}

In 1946, Bernard Lovell used one of the first radio telescopes to determine the size of one of these events, whose most atypical example is linked to the break up of 3200 Phaethon. One of these events named for St. Cyril was unique because it had no radiant, while the two best known ones were caused by objects called Tempel-Tuttle and Swift- Tuttle. The magnitude of these events can be assessed in terms of zenithal hourly rate, and many of these events pro- duce clouds of ionized silicon and magnesium in the upper atmosphere. Caused by the Earth passing through the de- bris stream of a comet, and including the Leonid in November and Perseid in August, identify these events in which many rocks enter the atmosphere at the same time, creating numerous bright streaks across the night sky.

answer: {hyperbolic} geometry [prompt on {non}-{Euclidean} geometry/ies; accept {Bolyai}-{Lobachevskian} geometry

This mathematical system can be modeled in the conformal disk model, or for the two-dimensional case by the half-plane model, both of which are named for Poincaré (poin-kar-AY). This system incorporates the ultraparallel theorem and possesses negative curvature, allowing Saccheri (suh-CAIR-ee) quadrilaterals in it to have acute summit angles. That is a consequence of allowing multiple lines through a particular point to be parallel to a given line, which also means that triangles in this type of system have degree sum less than one hundred eighty degrees. Developed by János (YAH-noash) Bolyai and Nikolai Lobachevsky, name this type of geometric system that violates Euclid's (YOO-klid's) fifth postulate, contrasted with Euclidean and elliptical geometries.

answer: first mass moment of inertia [accept {rotational} inertia or {angular} mass or {rotational} mass before “{rotation}"]

This quantity can be expressed as a tensor with the off-diagonal elements proportional to the products of two dis- tances which generally need to be integrated to cover a body. If a body lies in a plane, the sum of these values with re- spect to the axes in that plane equals this value with respect to the third axis. This value can be calculated about a dif- ferent axis in the parallel axis theorem, and for a solid sphere about a diameter, it has a coefficient of two-fifths. In general, this value is calculated by summing mass times radius squared for a body. Name this rotational analogue of mass, commonly represented by a capital I.
