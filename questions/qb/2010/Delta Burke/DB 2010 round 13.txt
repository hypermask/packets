answer: volcanoes

One of these structures, Ol Doinyo Lengai, produces natrocarbonatite. A tuya is an example of the subglacial type of these structures, which can produce jokulhlaups [yo-kul-h-loips]. These structures are responsible for the formation of cryptodomes, and they can also produce pahoehoe [puh-HOH-ee-hoh-ee] or aa [AH-ah]. The collapse of their center forms a caldera, and many of them are found around the Ring of Fire. For 10 points, name these openings in the Earth's crust through which lava is ejected, examples of which include Vesuvius and Krakatoa.

answer: Bertrand {Russell}

This thinker used the analogy of a British postal directory, in which the “same names come twice over, once in alphabetical and once in geographical order,” to illustrate his defense of “neutral monism.” This author of “On Denoting” argued that “acquaintance” and “description” are the two ways in which we can be aware of the world, while 1897's “An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry” was his first publication on the subject with which he is most associated: mathematical logic. That work led to his work with his most famous collaborator, Alfred North Whitehead. FTP name this British philosopher and co-author of Principia Mathematica.

One of these compounds is the starting material in the Danishefsky total synthesis of taxol. The hydroxy form of these compounds is obtained from phenyl esters in the Fries [FREEZ] rearrangement. The iodoform test gives a positive result for the methyl type of these compounds, which generally do not react with Tollens' reagent. These compounds react with Grignard reagents to form tertiary alcohols, and are obtained from the oxidation of secondary alcohols. These compounds are tautomers of enols, and their simplest example is used in nail polish remover. For 10 points, name these compounds that have two R groups bonded to a carbonyl.

answer: {plasma}

This substance contains a several Debye lengths layer known as the Debye sheath. The temperature of one part of this substance can be measured using a Langmuir probe, and the transfer of energy between particles and the wave results in Landau damping. A traveling oscillation that propagates in the direction of the magnetic field, known as an Alfven wave, can be found in this substance, which is confined by a magnetic field in a donut-shaped tube called a tokamak. Present in a fluorescent light bulb, it is also located in fusion reactors and the interior of the sun. For 10 points, name this ionized gas that is often called the fourth state of matter.
