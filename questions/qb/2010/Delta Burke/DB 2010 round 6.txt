answer: {ferromagnetism} [prompt on {magnetism}]

The loss of energy due to lag in the acquisition of this phenomenon is given by the Steinmetz equation. One model for this behavior sees it as a linking of discrete spin states in a lattice by a positive interaction coefficient given by the half difference in energy between the spin states. With phase changes described by that Ising model, this phenomenon's acquisition as a function of an external field can be plotted on a hysteresis curve. As it is acquired, Barkhausen noise results from the discrete changes in this phenomenon when a magnetic field is applied to a material. It disappears altogether above the Curie point. For 10 points, name this type of permanent magnetism held by such metals as nickel, copper, and iron.

The Archbishop of York commissioned a work from this artist which depicts Agrippina Landing at Brundisium with the Ashes of Germanicus. His Departure of Regulus from Rome was painted shortly before becoming the official historical painter for the king of England. Some art critics believe that his Death on a Pale Horse marks a shift away from the neoclassic toward the romantic. Nevertheless, historical subjects are what he is best known for, such as Penn's Treaty with the Indians and his most famous work, in which a British general strikes a Christ-like pose. FTP name this painter of The Death of General Wolfe.

answer: {Plessy} v. Ferguson

Leading up to this case, an organization including former governor PBS Pinchback was founded to combat the central act in this case. That group raised over $1,000 to hire Albion Tourgee as the attorney for the plaintiff, though that was for naught as the majority opinion delivered by Henry Billings Brown claimed that there was a de facto distinction between political and social terms in the 13th and 14th Amendments. Despite Harlan's famous dissenting opinion, the court ultimately deemed the Louisiana Separate Car Act constitutional. For 10 points, name this 1896 case condoning “separate but equal” facilities for African Americans on railroad cars.

answer: {boron} [accept {B} before mentioned]

The two naturally occurring isotopes of this element possess nuclear spins of 3 and 3/2 and thus may be used for NMR. It is a component of the naturally occurring mineral, ulexite, in which parallel fibers transmit light, creating a fiberoptic effect. In organic chemistry, a compound of this element is used in an addition reaction to an alkene in anti-Markovnikov orientation as opposed to oxymercuration. In forming trigonal planar molecules with the halogens, this element disobeys the octet rule. This is because it possesses only three valence electrons and thus forms only three bonds. For 10 points, identify this lightest metalloid with atomic number 5 and symbol B.

She promises to re-marry once she finishes weaving a burial shroud which she secretly unravels each night, causing her suitors to grow increasingly impatient.

Konstantin Bykov resolved the role of the corpus callosum in this organism prior to Sperry's studies in humans. Most studies of this organism have historically required surgical implantation of a device in its cheek that attaches to a machine that clicks whenever fluid in it is displaced.

In algebra, a generalization of this basic property on categories is the monomorphism. The inclusion map on sets, represented by a curved arrow, is the canonical map possessing this property. A linear transformation on a vector space possesses this property if and only if its kernel is zero. A function is termed bijective when it is both surjective and this, and f(x) equals f(y) implies x equals y for functions with this property. On the Cartesian plane, functions with this property pass the horizontal line test. For 10 points, name this property of a function where every element in the domain goes to no more than one element in the range and vice-versa.

Fawn Hall received a lighter punishment in the aftermath of this event due to her intimate knowledge of her boss's rolodex. This event was exposed in the Ash-Shiraa magazine, and in response, the President hired John Tower to head a group that ultimately cleared his name, while implicating Robert McFarlane, John Poindexter, and Oliver North, who all held roles on the National Security Council.
