One test for this concept involves 2-by-2 and 3-by-3 sets of patterns known as Raven's Progressive Matrices. One theory of this concept uses the method of Tetrad Differences to analytically prove the Two-Factor theory of this concept developed by Charles Spearman. Sternberg and Salter define it as Goal-directed adaptive behavior and Wechsler describes it as “aggregate global capacity of the individual to act.” Salovey and Mayer coined an emotional form of this concept, and the Flynn effect suggests that it has been increasing linearly since the earliest tests for it. For 10 points, name this concept often measured in quotient form, a test for which was famously developed at Stanford by Alfred Binet.

Heeger, MacDiarmid, and Shirakawa won a Nobel Prize for discovering a conductive form of these molecules. The dissolution of these molecules is modeled by the Flory–Huggins lattice theory. Some of these molecules with chirality centers are isotactic. Zirconium-based metallocenes and titanium tetrachloride have been used in Ziegler-Natta catalysts for synthesizing these molecules. A free-radical mechanism is involved in one type of chain growth process used to form these molecules, examples of which include nylon and polyethylene. For 10 points, name these large molecules that are formed by combining small molecules called monomers.
