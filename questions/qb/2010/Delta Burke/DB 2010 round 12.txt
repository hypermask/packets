answer: {entropy}

The change in this quantity is approximately the same for all liquids at their boiling temperature according to Trouton's rule. Taking the negative partial derivative of the Helmholtz free energy with respect to temperature gives this quantity, which can be calculated for ideal gases by the Sackur-Tetrode equation. Equal to the Boltzmann constant times the natural log of the number of microstates, this quantity can be decreased by the hypothetical Maxwell's demon. The second law of thermodynamics states all spontaneous processes lead to an increase in this property for the universe. For 10 points, name this property that measures the disorder in a system.

answer: Heisenberg {uncertainty} principle [or principle of {indeterminacy}]

This principle can be derived using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Robertson-Schrödinger relation. The namesake of this principle devised a thought experiment involving a gamma-ray microscope to illustrate it. The term Planck's constant divided by four appears in an inequality associated with this principle, which is valid for any pair of observables whose operators do not commute, such as energy and time. The standard form of this principle states it is impossible to simultaneously measure both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy.
