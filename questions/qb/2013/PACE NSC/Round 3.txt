answer: {equilibrium constant} [or {K}; accept {stability} constant, {association} constant, {dissociation} constant, or {binding} constant]

For a complex, this value increases down the Irving-Williams series. The negative of this value is the slope of a line in a Scatchard plot. One form of this quantity can be converted into another by multiplying by RT raised to the difference in the number of moles of gas. The change in this quantity for a given change in temperature is related to the enthalpy of the reaction by van't Hoff's equation. The change in Gibbs free energy for a (*) reaction equals negative RT times the natural log of this quantity. The law of mass action equates this value to the concentrations of the products divided by the concentrations of the reactants. For 10 points, name this constant representing a chemical system where the forward and reverse reactions have the same rate.
