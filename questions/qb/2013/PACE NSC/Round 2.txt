answer: {Bayes}’ theorem [or {Bayes}’ law]

Cromwell’s rule limits the cases where this theorem can be applied. This theorem is used to find the credibility interval. This theorem is used by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and can also be used to solve the Monty Hall Problem. The CRM114 program uses a Markov Field to improve upon results obtained with this theorem in spam filtering. This theorem is used to calculate the posterior (*) probability, and relates the actual probability of an event to the measured probability in a test. For 10 points, name this theorem which allows probability to change upon the acquisition of new evidence and is written as the probability of A given B equals probability of B given A times probability of A over probability of B.

answer: {Aluminum} [or {Al}]

A di-iso-butyl hydride of this element is used to transform acid chlorides into aldehydes. Like iron, a Lewis acid of this element is often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. One method for extracting this element uses an aqueous sodium hydroxide and works because this element is soluble in strong bases, but iron oxide is not. That process is supplemented by a cathodic deposition of this element through the use of (*) molten cryolite and the oxide of this element. This element is produced by the Bayer and Hall-Heroult processes. It is the most abundant metal in the Earth’s crust and extracted from bauxite. For 10 points, name this lightweight element with atomic number 13, a metal often used in soda cans.

This experiment was criticized in Chris Ferguson's paper "Blazing Angels or Resident Evil?" that claimed that the effect this study produced was short-lived and that it misinterpreted the motivations of its subjects. A 1992 paper co-written by Elizabeth Loftus questioned the ethics of this study that was organized by three people including Sheila and Dorothea Ross.

This quantity's namesake waves are low-level excitations in continuously symmetric magnetic lattices, and magnons are the quantizations of those waves. A theorem partly named for this quantity states that the wavefunction of a system is either symmetric or antisymmetric under particle interchange, depending on the particles’ value for this quantity. Though (*) Pauli initially rejected this concept, his namesake matrices are used in its mathematical formulation, and it doubles the number of possible states according to the Pauli exclusion principle.
