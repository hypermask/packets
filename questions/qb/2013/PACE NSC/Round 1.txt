answer: {solubility} [accept {hydropathy}, {hydrophobicity}, and {hydrophilicity} up to "Hildebrand", prompt after]

The Hofmeister series originally ordered substances by their ability to change this property for proteins. The square root of the cohesive energy density gives the Hildebrand parameter for it. For an ionic compound, this property is lowered due to the formation of ion pairs. The ratio of this value for two phases is given by the partition coefficient. Its namesake constant is the product of (*) ionic species. It is reduced for two substances that produce the same charged species according to the common ion effect. Rules governing this property state that acetates and nitrates always have it, but barium sulfate does not. A saturated mixture by definition does not have any more capability for it. For 10 points, name this property of a substance to dissolve in a solvent.

Two opposing ones of these devices can be used to create a transorb. One type of these devices achieves microwave-frequency operation by using quantum tunneling. The current through one of these can be approximated as the saturation current times the exponential of the voltage divided by a constant times the thermal voltage, according to the (*) Shockley equation. One type can be used as a voltage-controlled capacitor, and the Zener type can safely conduct in the reverse direction when above the breakdown voltage. Under reverse bias, the depletion region widens, stopping the current. They consist of a p-n junction, and allow current to flow in one direction only. For 10 points, name these electronic components, some of which are “light-emitting.”
