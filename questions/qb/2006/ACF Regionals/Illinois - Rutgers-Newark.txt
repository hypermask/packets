His attorney general, Godfrey Lule, often had to defend this man's practices at the United Nations, while his defense minister, Mustafa Adrisi, was his brother-in-law. Upon taking power, he murdered his main rival, Pierino Okoya, and he created the Public Safety Unit and the State Research Center, whose employees spent most of the time murdering members of the Langi and Acholi tribes and feeding their bodies to Nile crocodiles. A member of the Kakwa ethnic group, after becoming chief of his country's army and air force, he deposed Milton Obote in a coup. FTP, name this man accused of helping the Palestinians at Entebbe, who, from 1971 to 1979, was dictator of Uganda.

answer: {Barbarella}: Queen of the Galaxy

Taking place in the year 40000, this work's cast of bizarre characters include Pygar, a blind angel who has lost the will to fly, and an inept revolutionary named Dildano. The screenplay for this film was written by Terry Southern of Dr. Strangelove fame. Although the galaxy's best hope, the title character frequently crashes and is captured by wild children in the Tau Seti system. The action begins when that heroine, floating in zero gravity, is interrupted by a call from the President of Earth. Outlining the quest to find the young scientist Duran-Duran, who threatens the galactic peace, this is, FTP, what campy 1968 movie starring Jane Fonda as the title Queen of the Galaxy?

Described as the “offspring of silence, sky-bolt of Ninurta,” this person dumbfounds a hunter who encounters him at the watering place. This character dreams of the council at which he is sentenced to death and of the “house of dust” that awaits him; his predictions prove accurate, as he is struck-down by illness for slaying the Bull of Heaven. Civilized by the attentions of Shamhat, in tablets III-V he prepares to fight Humbaba with his friend, who mourns for this clay-born bull-man in tablet VIII's lament, then goes off to seek Utnapishtam. FTP, name this character who was designed to “to match the ardor of the energies” of the King of Uruk, Gilgamesh.

Green, red, yellow, white, and blue make-up the symbolic star of this faith; these colors represent the five ministers that govern it. Members in Syria are known as Jabal and believe in the divine unity of humanity and reincarnation. A namesake revolt in 1925 resulted in the exile of its leaders to Palmyra, although this was ended two years later. Knowledge of the Kitab-al-hikma is restricted to those who have made the passage from juhhal to uqqal, from “ignorant” or “knower.” It is likely that the object of their worship is the former Fatimid caliph al-Hakim. FTP, name this highly secretive sect of Islam which derives its name from that of a forerunner of the community, Muhammad al-Durazi.

answer: Edward {II} (prompt on {Edward})

A letter found in 1878 shows that this man was not murdered, but rather escaped by killing the gate keeper, changing clothes with a servant, and living at Corfe Castle. He became heir to the throne at a young age after the death of his elder brother, Alfonso. His mother was Eleanor of Castile and he drew the ambivalence of his wife after restoring the Despenser barons to power. She teamed up with Roger Mortimer to depose him and he was later imprisoned at Berkeley Castle. Supposedly killed by a hot copper wire inserted in his anus, this is, FTP, what Plantagenet king, the subject of a Christopher Marlowe play and the effeminate son of Edward Longshanks?

answer: {Vision} After the {Sermon} (or {Jacob Wrestling} the {Angel})

Its pictorial composition was inspired by an Emile Bernard painting and it was the painter's first definitive break with the orthodox Cloissonist style. Across the top center of this painting appears to run the trunk of a tree and it contains at least twelve distinct forms of life, one of which is a bull. The tree divides the scene on the right side from the Breton people with their hands clasped in prayer in the foreground. The strikingly red background punctuates the colors in the right-hand side of the painting, which shows one man dressed in black attempting to subdue another man who is dressed in blue and has wings. FTP, name this painting by Paul Gauguin depicting a memorable scene involving a son of Isaac.

answer: Symphony {No. 2} in {C Minor} (“{Resurrection}”) (accept {Mahler's second symphony} before it's mentioned)

Its third movement includes such unorthodox instrumentation as a clarinet tuned to E flat and a bass drum meant to be struck by a bundle of twigs. The fourth movement contains a march that features offstage brass and timpani and a solo flute that plays a “nightingale song.” Originally titled Totenfeier after a poem of Adam Mickiewicz, it includes the chorale Aufersteh'n heard at the funeral of the composer's friend Bülow and written by Klopstock and a scene representing a saint of Padua preaching to some disinterested fish. According to the composer, he was burying the hero of his last symphony in this one and, indeed, it starts with a funeral march. FTP, identify this epic symphony of Gustav Mahler, his second.

Martin du Gard's Jean Barois incorporates news clippings of this event and it led to a break between Anton Chekhov and his friend Suvorin. Its effects on politics included the formation of a new cabinet by Rene-Waldeck Rousseau and riots at the funeral of president Felix Faure. Although first brought to the public eye by Scheurer-Kestner, it had begun when an agent from the Section of Statistics discovered an unsigned document in the office of von Schwartzkoppen. The identity of the bordereau's author was finally discovered by Georges Picquart, but the forger Colonel Henry committed suicide and Major Esterhazy escaped to England unpunished. FTP, name this scandal in the French military over the innocence of the namesake Jewish captain, made famous by Emile Zola's J'accuse.

One character in this play was a “chantoosie” who was taken from the Blue Dragon after she sang “That Old Black Magic.” In act two, a drunken college professor reenacts the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet with a waitress named Elma who, Grace points out, is too bright for boys her age. Other characters include Virgil Blessing, who has served as guardian to a cowboy from Montana for eleven years, and Sheriff Will Masters, who is suspicious of Dr. Lyman. In the end, Cherie agrees to go to Montana with Bo Decker and Carl drives the title vehicle away to Wichita.

answer: {free rider} problem (or {free riding}; prompt on {tragedy} of the {commons} before it's mentioned)

Grossman and Hart have suggested that failure of some corporate takeovers may be due to this behavior that, according to Ronald Coase, can be reduced by lowering transaction costs to near zero. In a 1968 essay, Garrett Hardin discounted the possibility of natural altruism and argued that, in the context of positive externalities, laissez faire policies inevitably lead to it. The tit-for-tat approach may be appropriate for one analog, the iterated prisoner's dilemma, but the concept of a public good leads to a tragedy of the commons in a more general situation. FTP, name this economic problem in which actors avoid paying for goods that cannot be taken away.

answer: {Hilbert} spaces

Operator algebras on objects of this type are known as W-star or von Neumann algebras and it was von Neumann who named these structures in a 1929 paper in Mathematische Annalen. Grover's algorithm requires two angles between three members of one of these corresponding to the state space of a quantum computer. Every one of these is also a Banach space, but the converse does not hold. They are inner product spaces such that the resulting norm makes them complete metric spaces. FTP, name these algebraic structures named for a mathematician who delivered a famous 1900 address to the Paris International Congress of Mathematics.

In the sequel to the work in which this character appears, his grandson, Michael, is tried for bribery. In that work, his son, Isaac, is at odds with Michael over the same issue with which he was at odds with Issac. In the original work in which he appeart, the arrival of Mr. Brown and Reverend Smith has caused the proverbial titular action, against which he retaliates by burning a church. His retaliation is precipitated by his displeasure over Isaac's conversion, which is exacerbated by the desecration of a sacred mask. Previously exiled when his gun accidentally discharged and killed a man, he hangs himself when he is unsuccessful in leading his people into war against their white colonizers. FTP, name this protagonist of No Longer at Ease and Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe.

answer: 

“A mirror of man in his fallen state” is how Hazard Adams describes the meaning of this work, in which the poet considers a furnace, a hammer, a chain, and an anvil as possible tools used in creating the title entity. An allusion to Genesis is included in the penultimate stanza, “When the stars threw down their spears, / And watered heaven with their tears, / Did he smile his work to see?” Before that, the author wondered, “what art / Could twist the sinews” of a heart and “What the hand dare seize the fire?” that burnt in an eye. FTP, name this lyric from Songs of Experience in which the “fearful symmetry” of the titular animal is marveled at by William Blake.

Early in his career, he was an ally of a faction founded by Gulian Verplanck and was nicknamed “King Coody” as a result. As a lawyer, he defended the abolitionist Jacob Gruber and succeeded William Wirt as attorney general of his state. After replacing William Duane, he ordered the end of federal deposits into the Second Bank of the United States as Secretary of the Treasury, but Jackson's bid to replace Gabriel Duvall with this man was a failure. In his most famous role, this man dealt with the power of state courts in Ableman v. Booth, the sanctity of state contracts in the Charles River Bridge case and with habeas corpus in ex parte Merryman. FTP, identify this fifth Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court who presided over the Dred Scott case.

answer: {apoptosis} (accept {programmed cell death})

A very likely key regulator of this process is ALG-2, a calcium-binding protein. Reactive oxygen species may cause Bcl-2 to activate Bax, which leads to activation of various caspases. Its indicators include exposure of surface phospholipids to phosphatidylserine and the secretion of TGF-beta by cytokines. In plants, it is accomplished by proteases that cleave at asparagine residues, which cause collapse of the central vacuole. It is involved in such events as formation of synapses and the sloughing-off of the endometrial lining. FTP, identify this process by which normal development of multicellular organisms is genetically controlled, and which is different from necrosis.

In one of this man's poems, Strephon discovers that his beloved Celia “shits” after entering the title locale, a “Lady's Dressing Room.” He uses the analogy of the Trojan horse “pregnant with Greeks” to describe Tories and Whigs huddled under a shed in “Description of a City Shower,” which is often paired with the urban georgic “A Description of the Morning.” He wrote a series of polemics against the monopoly on copper coinage granted to William Wood in Drapier's Letters and his correspondence with Esther Johnson was collected in the Journal to Stella, although he is better known for a satire about Peter, Martin, and Jack and a novel whose hero was first a surgeon, then a captain of many ships.

answer: {Thomas} precession

The factor of one-half resulting from this effect cancels with the factor of two error in the naive gyromagnetic ratio, so that a semi-classical calculation of spin-orbit coupling coincidentally yields the same results as the full relativistic one. It occurs in general because, over an accelerating path, the orientation of the velocity varies harmonically relative to that in an inertial frame. Because Lorentz boosts do not commute with rotations, there exists a time dilation between the frame of an orbiting charge and that of a nucleus, so the electron undergoes this motion as it orbits. FTP, name this type of purely relativistic precession most notably undergone by atomic electrons and named for an English physicist.

It was first exhibited under the title The Defeated One and was also titled The Awakening of Humanity at one point. The plaster version of this sculpture was displayed at the Cercle Artistique in Brussels and this version is recognized because of valuable photographs by Marconi and Druet. Its strangeness attracted the attention of L'Etoile Belge, who thought it represented a man on the verge of committing suicide. Its model was a twenty-two-year-old Belgian soldier, Auguste Neyt, and in order to discredit its creator, his contemporaries claimed the sculpture was cast from life. The better-recognized bronze version of it was commissioned by Edmund Turquet, the director of the Beaux-Arts, in 1900. FTP, name this Rodin sculpture of a nude man touching his head with one hand.

A ballet based upon this work was produced by Sir Robert Helpmann. The aria “Red as the rose in Maytime” expresses Camille de Rousillon's desire to find a suitable wife, which leads to his many social flirtations. This work takes place in and around Maxim's, which is sung about in the famous song “Vilia.” Baron Zeta is concerned for the economic welfare of Pontevedro and thus tries to convince his wife, Valencienne, to hook the Count Danilo Danilovitsch up with the title character, whose former husband has left her a fortune. For 10 points, name this operetta about Anna Glawari and her messing-around with foreign guys; a work of Franz Lehár.
