The site of a minor 1862 victory by Ambrose Bierce and of a Civil War-era colony for freedmen, it was first explored in the sixteenth century by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe. Among its first residents were the third man to circumnavigate the globe, Thomas Cavendish; the scientist Thomas Hariot; and the friendly native Americans Granganimeo and Wingina. Its early leaders included Richard Grenville, the captain of the Tyger, and John White, a surveyor whose granddaughter Virginia was the first English child born in the Americas. White returned to England in 1587 to get more settlers but on his return found only a tree-carving of the word “Croatoan.” FTP, name this “Lost Colony” located in the Outer Banks of North Carolina.

answer: The {Phenomenology} of {Spirit} or {Phänomenologie des Geistes} (or The {Phenomenology} of {Mind})

In the fourth chapter of this work, the author describes the need for social interaction, beginning with a struggle to the death. Having learned that a corpse cannot provide validation, the next interaction becomes a struggle for dominion, resulting in lord and bondsman forms of self-consciousness. Its famous Preface outlines the author's characteristic method of Zusehen. Contrary to popular belief, this work was not finished the night before Napoleon's invasion of Jena, where its author had a university position. FTP, name this book tracing the path of consciousness to absolute knowledge, the first major work of Hegel.

answer: RNA {interference} (or {interfering} RNA)

The Maleficent system allows this tool to be used stably in mammalian cells. Proteins from the Argonaute family and Dicer make up the RISC complex that carry out the cleavage step in this process. First studied by Jorgenson in petunias, it is known as “quelling” in Neurospora. While it is now primarily used as an alternative to gene knockout, it may someday be useful therapeutically in silencing viral gene expression. FTP, name this tool from molecular biology, so named because it uses double-stranded RNA to disrupt gene expression.

answer: {Moon} (or {Luna})

This location's deposits of KREEP basalts are thought to date from the Pre-Nectarian period, and it has the largest known minable deposits of the advanced fusion fuel helium-three. Low volatile abundances provide evidence against George Darwin's of its formation, but oxygen isotope ratios argue against gravitational capture, so this body may have formed during an encounter involving a Mars-sized impactor after terrestrial core-formation. Its tidal locking has led to a thicker crust on one side, explaining the uneven distribution of smooth basalt plains with relatively little cratering, known as maria [MAH-ree-uh]. FTP, name this natural satellite of the Earth.

answer: Spiro Theodore {Agnew}

His books include a thriller called The Canfield Decision, in which a radical Jewish group teams up with the Iranians to destroy détente, and a 1980 memoir entitled Go Quietly… or Else. His political career began through the connections of Judge Herbert Moser, a supermarket executive, and another judge, E. Lester Barrett, influenced his decision to turn Republican. He defeated a segregationist named George Mahoney in his state's 1966 gubernatorial race. Well-known for quotes like “if you've seen one city slum, you've seen them all” and for his William Safire-written attack on reporters as “an effete corps of impudent snobs” and “nattering nabobs of negativism,” he was fined ten thousand dollars for taking bribes as governor of Maryland. FTP, name the man who resigned as Richard Nixon's vice president in 1973.

His mother Elfrida, in her quest to put him on the throne, killed his half-brother, who was later considered a martyr, and during his reign his theigns defeated the Norwegians at Maldon. According to William of Malmesbury, he defecated in the font at his baptism, and he brought disaster to England on St. Brice's Day when he ordered a massacre of the Danes. In response to this, Sweyn Forkbeard launched a campaign to conquer England, but died several weeks after achieving his goal, allowing this man to retake his throne in 1014. FTP, name this father of Edmund Ironsides and Edward the Confessor, a pre-Norman English king whose epithet means “without counsel.”

answer: {infrared} spectroscopy

This technique may be used to find Fermi resonances in acid chlorides. Preparation of compounds for use in this technique may involve making a mull in nujol, mixing with potassium bromide, or depositing a thin film on a sodium chloride cell. A molecular dipole moment shift is required for a vibration to be visible using this technique. Hydrogen bonding lowers the frequency of the hydroxyl group stretch, and vibrations between four hundred and one thousand, six hundred wavenumbers are considered the fingerprint region for organic compounds studied using this method. FTP, identify this type of spectroscopy useful in identifying functional groups whose vibrations are excited by wavelengths of light that are longer than visible light.

answer: {Christoph Willibald von Gluck}

Several of his early works, including such operas as Cleonice, Demofoonte, and Artaserse, were written with librettist Pietro Metastasio. He had begun composing an opera based on the Song of Roland, but the discovery that Niccolo Piccini was given the same libretto to work on sparked a rivalry in the Parisian press and motivated him to compose Armide. Collaboration with the librettist Calzabigi resulted in the composition of the ballets Semiramide and Don Juan, as well as an opera featuring the “Dance of the Blessed Spirits” and another in whose preface he declared his intent to “restrict music to its true office of serving poetry.” FTP, identify this German classical composer of “reform” operas such as Alceste and Orfeo et Euridice.

answer: Jawaharlal {Nehru}

In his early life he was influenced by the theosophism of his tutor, Ferdinand Brooks. During World War II, the envoys Lord Wavell and Stafford Cripps failed to reconcile his party with the rival party, founded by Aga Khan III. In his most important post, he put through the Community Development Program and the 1951 five-year plan, going against the conservative politics of his father, Motilal. Although under the influence of his minister Menon he was a leader of the non-aligned movement, he called for western aid when China encroached upon the Brahmaputra River. FTP name this continuing leader of the Congress Party despite the protests of Sardar Patel and Gandhi, the grandfather of Sanjay and father of Indira Gandhi and first prime minister of independent India.

This text's author described it as a “loathsome, distended, tumefied, bloated, dropsical mass,” and shortly after its publication he arranged for Hugo Münsterberg to take over his duties in the title field. The fourth chapter opens by describing living creatures as “bundles of habits,” and later in that chapter the author concludes, “Habit is thus the enormous fly-wheel of society.” A later chapter argues that the arousal of a physical response precedes the appearance of the associated emotion, a theory similar to that of Lange. FTP, name this work published in 1890 that introduced the term “stream of consciousness,” a textbook on “the Science of Mental Life” written by William James.

One of this work's characters is interrupted repeatedly with the phrase “lost his oil jar,” while another is made to understand human desire by analogy to his love of pea soup. After the central character dons the robe of the pea-soup-loving character, he is accused of stealing Cerberus by Aeacus, leading him to switch costumes with his servant, Xanthias. The central conflict is eventually resolved by considering what to do with Alcibiades and with the weighing of verses. FTP, identify this work culminating in the return to Athens of the victorious Aeschylus; an Aristophanes comedy in which Dionysus enters the underworld to fetch Euripides and, while crossing the River Acheron, meets a chorus of the titular amphibians.
