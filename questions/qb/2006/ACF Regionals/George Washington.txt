Late in his life, he was exonerated for supporting Bonnie Prince Charlie while his early career saw him serve as aide-de-camp to Prince Eugene of Savoy. He helped defeat the Ottomans at Belgrade but, during the War of Jenkin's Ear, he tried to capture St. Augustine and was repulsed. His most influential friends included the former gentleman Robert Castell and the Yamacraw chief Tomochichi. After the former died, he began his crusade to reform prisons in England, while the latter convinced him to settle near the Altamaha River. FTP, identify this man who received his royal state charter in 1732 and who hoped to create a home for oppressed Protestants and falsely imprisoned debtors in the New World near what is now Savannah.

answer: “The {Problem} of {Social Cost}”

Part seven of this eight-part work is anchored by a discussion of 1597's Boulston case, where the court tried to argue for corn-thieving rabbits as nuisance. Other sections focus on the “reciprocal nature” of the title concept and a dismissal of Pigou's ideas in The Economics of Welfare. Expanding on an earlier essay's arguments about the importance of transaction costs to the growth of the firm, this 1960 work argued that the initial allocation of legal rights doesn't matter when the economic result is efficient, an idea now known as its author's eponymous economic theorem. FTP, identify this classic article by Ronald Coase.

answer: the {Susquehanna} River

After flowing South past Selinsgrove, it cuts through the Mahantongo Mountain and receives the Juniata River. The Chemung flows southeast past Elmira into it and its brook trout were once hunted by the namesake Indian tribes on its banks. While its Western branch rises in the Allegheny Mountains, the main portion of this river originates in Otsego Lake in New York and exits at Havre de Grace, Maryland. FTP, identify this mighty river that provides half of the fresh water for the Chesapeake Bay.

answer: the Battle of {Puebla}

One brigade was deployed at the “brickworks” while another force, the African Hunters, attempted to scale the walls of one of the five forts that defended the namesake site, which had just survived the Wars of Reform. After fearing that his ill soldiers were threatened, General de Lorencz marched from Orizaba ready for battle. The infantry of the victorious force was led by future president Porfirio Diaz but it was the main force under the command of General Zaragoza that won the day.

answer: “The {Waste Land}”

The second part opens with a woman on “a burnished throne” and ends with another woman at a bar telling her friend Lil about her decision to sleep with Albert. In this work, the Moon shines on Mrs. Porter and her daughter who wash their feet in soda water, a moment that is followed by a memory of Tereus raping Philomela. The middle section features Tiresias lamenting his man breasts and the final fragment features a cock standing on a rooftree calling out “Co co rico,” which brings a flash of lightning and then, rain. That part, “What the Thunder Said,” concludes with the repetition of the word “Shantih.” FTP, identify this work full of footnotes; a modernist poem dedicated to Ezra Pound and written by T.S. Eliot.

answer: the {Amritsar Massacre}

It was exacerbated by the death of a Mrs. Sherwood and was preceded by Miles Irving arresting two vocal nationalists, Drs. Kitchloo and Satyapal. Partly caused by the reshuffling of domestic politics after the end of the war codified by the Black or Rowlatt Acts, it only took about fifteen minutes but was more deadly since there were no easy avenues to escape. Taking place in the Garden or Jallianwallah Bagh, it saw the death of more than four hundred Hindus. FTP, identify this event that saw the British General Dyer fire into an unarmed crowd in 1919 in the namesake capital of the Sikhs.

answer: The {Moonstone}

Minor characters include the evangelist Drusilla Clack and the moneylender Septimus Luker. The prologue details a rivalry that begins after General Baird's forces storm Seringapatam and addresses the narrator's dislike of John Herncastle. Murthwaite later sees the ubiquitous jugglers in their true form, but this only happens after Mr. Candy's assistant, Ezra, reveals that it was opium that caused Franklin Blake to take what was once found in the forehead of a god's statue. FPT, identify this 1868 novel that focuses on Rachel Verrinder and Sergeant Cuff's attempts to find a lost gem; a work by Wilkie Collins.

answer: Dirac {delta} function

This distribution appears in and is the reason for the name of the distribution solution to Poisson's equation. Generalizations of this to vector arguments are non-unique but can be determined by normalizing its all-space integral in light of any relevant symmetries. Reciprocity for Green's functions for self-adjoint operators results from the odd parity of this since Green's functions are the solutions to operator equations with this as the inhomogeneous term. Its convolution with a function gives the value of that function at the point where its argument vanishes by its sifting property. FTP, name this function defined by Dirac and named for a Greek letter.

answer: {Ganymede}

His adventures are compared to those of Boreas in the first section of the Phaedrus. Often shown holding a chicken, he grew up in Phrygia and was indirectly responsible for his brother's immortality, an attribute bargained for by Eos, who originally fetched him. Grief over his departure was assuaged somewhat by the two swift horses that Hermes brought his father and his story was used by Appolodorus and Plato to argue for the superiority of male love. This brother of Tithonus and son of Laomedon eventually succeeded Hebe in her primary position on Mt. Olympus. FTP, identify this Trojan prince who was loved by Zeus and became the cupbearer of the gods.

answer: {El Sombrero} de {tres picos}, ballet in {2 parts}, {G. 53} (or The {Three}-{Cornered Hat}; accept any underlined part)

After the protagonist is arrested, this work refers to Beethoven's Fifth with a knock of fate. Other pieces sprinkled into this two-part work include the blackbird's song and a jota danced to the magistrate's humiliation. As it proceeds, the recurring Corregidor character dances various minuets while the flirty wife and her fandangos drive her earnest Miller husband crazy with jealousy. The opening, complete with castanets and an “olé” is often reproduced by itself. FTP, identify this work based on a story by Pedro de Alarcon and named for the antagonist's headwear; a ballet by Manuel de Falla.

His father was a successful paper manufacturer who wrote two books on the coins of the ancient Britons. His greatest discovery was made with his friend Duncan Mackenzie by his side, though he debated many points about the origins of culture with Carl Blegen and Alan Wace. A former keeper of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, he would inspire Michael Ventris to decipher a language he had always insisted was Greek. FTP, identify this archaeologist who wrote The Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult and restored the Palace of Minos at Knossos.

The transcription factor for these chemicals is repressed by DELLA and they are received by a namesake “-insensitive dwarf mutant 1” complex. These nineteen- or twenty-member heterocyclic rings are unsynthesizable in the presence of ancymidol, function by altering transcription, and display an atypical sigmoidal dose response. Mendel's Le gene is for a protein synthesizing these hormones which is understandable since that gene affects pea height. Discovered by Kurosawa in 1926, they were later named for the fungus that he noted as the cause of “foolish seedling” disease — unnaturally rapid rice enlargement caused by these plant hormones. FTP, name this class of plant hormones that stimulate stem and leaf growth.

answer: {Prosper Merimee}

A young lord is given three wishes by Jesus Christ in his Federigo while The Backgammon Game focuses on unspoken passion. He wrote plays about South America, like The Occasion, as well as the novel Tamango about a slave revolt, but his later life was taken-up with translating Pushkin and Gogol. Of his more famous stories, one concerns a shepherd who has to kill his son Fortunato, while another focuses on Orso, who tries to keep his sister from killing everyone. He used the name “Joseph L'Etrange” to publish the farcical Theatre of Clara Gazul but remains best known for works about life in Corsica such as Mateo Falcone and Colomba. FTP, identify this French author who also created the characters Don Jose and Escamillo in his work Carmen.

answer: {Wolff}-{Kishner} reduction

In an October, 1997 JCE article, Parquet and Lin outlined a microwave-assisted version of this procedure that creates a reagent in situ by irradiation of isatin. This reaction is analogous to hydroxylamine-mediated oxime synthesis. It is sometimes cited as only its second step, which is usually catalyzed by an alkali ethoxide or potassium hydroxide, but that second step cannot proceed without an initial hydroxone formation by the carbonyl-containing reactants. It is now rarely performed since it requires extremely dangerous heating of hydrazine in the presence of ketones or aldehydes. FTP, name this organic reduction of ketones or aldehydes to corresponding alkanes, named for German and Russian chemists.

answer: “A {Room} of {One's Own}”

Mary Carmichael is discussed for having “broken the sentence, broken the sequence,” while an important scene features a Beadle telling the narrator to keep off the grass. Later, the petulant Mr. A is taken to task and the text reflects on the life of aunt Mary Beton. The final chapter forwards the concept of androgyny as a creative force. Celebrating such pioneers as Aphra Behn and the Brontes, it was based on two lectures delivered in 1928 it focuses on the importance of the novel to the development of the woman writer. Featuring the hypothetical Judith Shakespeare, it argues for the privacy and independence of the title location. FTP, identify this essay by Virginia Woolf.

Five hundred fifty-eight names are found on its inside walls while the outside bases are decorated by such reliefs as Peace, Resistance and The Departure of the Volunteers. The horses that once graced its roof have been returned to St. Mark's in Venice, but the eternal flame remains lit. Designed by Jean Chalgrin, it sits on top of the hill of Chaillot and its full name is usually appended with the designation “of the star.” FTP, identify this structure originally commissioned after Austerlitz by Napoleon and modeled after the Arch of Constantine; the premier emblem of French patriotism.

Encapsulation can be accomplished by use of the opaque variety of this structure and segmentation faults are generally caused by access of a non-physical address by one. These explicitly allow manipulation of their contents, the namesake type of arithmetic. Iterators are an extension of these that are subject, usually, to postfix operators and a simple singly linked list object contains variable storage and one of these to the same type of object. As these do not contain literals but only the location of literals, they must be dereferenced before use, which is accomplished in C++ by the star operator. FTP, name these types of references that hold the memory address of something of interest, rather than the thing itself.

answer: {Charles Fourier}

According to his ideas, human children gravitated towards material exercises rather than study and “Celadony” was the most sublime love a human could feel. He argued that the passions were “untamed tigers” and that there were twelve common types that identified every human being. Inspired by works like The False Industry and Universal Harmony, his principal disciple, Victor Considerant, would try to found a colony in Texas, but it was Albert Brisbane who really helped popularize his The Theory of the Four Movements in the U.S. FTP, identify this French utopian philosopher who founded cooperative groups called phalanxes.

answer: The {Gulf Stream}

Painted during the artist's shift towards more abstract watercolors, this oil work was created after two separate trips to Nassau. The scene features numerous stalks of sugar cane that lie scattered at the central figure's feet. Some critics have speculated that the “rigger” in the upper left-hand corner was added in order to offer hope and make the work more appealing to buyers. FTP, identify this picture depicting a tumultuous water spout, raging sharks, and a seemingly stoic black man awaiting his demise; a painting of a boat drifting along the titular ocean current by Winslow Homer.
