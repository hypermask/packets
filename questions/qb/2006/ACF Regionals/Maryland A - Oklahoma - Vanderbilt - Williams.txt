answer: Landscape with the Fall of {Icarus}

In the upper left, one can see some buildings in the distance fading into some hazy hills at the edge of a harbor. Several ships sail in the harbor though only one, with a bellying mainsail, features prominently on the right side. A singing shepherd tends to his sheep near the center and a man appears to be fishing in the lower right corner. In the lower left, the most visible scene shows a horse pulling a plow in front of a colorfully dressed farmer. All of these scenes, however, distract the viewer from the titular event in the lower right, depicted as a cascade of feathers and a pair of legs sticking out of the water. FTP, name this Peter Bruegel painting pitting the son of Daedalus against an Italian coastal setting.

One psychologist quantified this faculty with the exponential of the negative ratio of time and capacity strength and Henri Bergson theorized ordinary and pure variants. George Miller suggested seven plus or minus two as a magic number limit of it and Marvin Minsky discounted the possibility of the eidetic type. In literature, the taste of a petite madeline dipped in linden-flower tisane triggered experiences of it which would not be possible for suffers of Korsakoff's syndrome. FTP, name this cognitive faculty famously studied by Hermann Ebbinghaus, the nuances of which Marcel Proust explored in the work In Search of Lost Time, and which is of great utility in quizbowl.

answer: Donato {Bramante}

His early career was spent painting, producing poorly preserved works in the Casa Prinetti and Casa Fontana. After becoming court architect for Lodovico Sforza, he designed the choir and transept of the Santa Maria della Grazie and the Canonica of San Ambrogio. One of his last projects was the extension of the Vatican Belvedere as two long, parallel structures. The influence of Leonardo can be seen in the radial design, including a cylindrical cella surrounded by a circular peristyle, of a shrine on the site where St. Peter was crucified. His most monumental design employed a Greek cross with four equal arms and a large hemishpheric dome. FTP, name this favorite architect of Julius II; the creator of the Tempietto and the original designer of St. Peter's Basilica.

answer: John Paul {Jones}

He had an affair with Louis XV's daughter, the Countess La Vendahl, and, late in life, he commanded an expedition against the Turks at Liman, but the jealousy of Count Nassau-Siegen caused his dismissal. He obtained a reputation for cruelty after flogging the carpenter Mungo Maxwell and running-through the leader of a mutiny, causing him to change his name after fleeing Tobago in 1773. Other antics include his attempted rape of a ten-year-old during his time in the Russian navy, but he is best known for an action involving the British ship Countess of Scarborough. FTP, name this Scottish-born captain best known for shouting “I have not yet begun to fight” and his service in the American Navy on the Bonhomme Richard.

answer: {blue stragglers}

The first direct observation of one of these bodies, one in 47 Tucanae, was made on October 29, 1997 using the FOS. The collision and slow coalescence models seek to explain their formation; both are supported by the fact that these are more numerous in regions of high density, like the cores of globular clusters. These stars, exemplified by those in NGC 6397 and BSS 19, seem to contradict most theories of stellar evolution; they fall along the main sequence despite being beyond turnoff points. FTP, what is this class of stars, which are significantly hotter than neighboring cluster stars with the same luminosity and, as a consequence, display a characteristic color?

answer: Gyorgy {Ligeti}

Two operas by this composer, based on Oedipus and The Tempest, were never completed. Early works like Musica ricercata and Apparitions were published much later than their composition due to government censorship in his country but, upon fleeing to Germany, he wrote Volumina, the electronic piece Artikulation, and a work with a title borrowed from a Karl Popper phrase, Clocks and Clouds. His Poeme symphonique is a work for a hundred “preferably pyramid-shaped” metronomes, while his only completed opera was based on a Michel de Ghelderode play and is titled Le Grande Macabre, but he is better known for Atmospheres and two other works that appeared in a 1968 Kubrick film. FTP, identify this Hungarian composer whose Lux Aeterna and Requiem can be found in the score for 2001: A Space Odyssey.

answer: {Jones oxidation} (prompt on {oxidation})

This process can by begun by addition of Collins reagent or its namesake's reagent; both contain the hexavalent metal central to it. That metal can be activated in the presence of pyridinium hydrochloride under anhydrous conditions, but a sulfuric acid medium is generally used to increase the rate. Discovered by Bowden, not its namesake, in 1946, this reaction requires care as it is highly exothermic and leaves an extremely toxic residue. The steric bulk of tertiary alcohols precludes their participation in this reaction, and it is usually carried out in acetone. FTP, name this organic reaction in which primary alcohols are transformed into carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones under catalysis by chromium oxide.

Hausdorff's generalization of this statement relates it directly to the inaccessible cardinals axiom, which was used by Solovay to solve the related Lebesgue [luh-BEG] measurability problem. Freiling's axiom of symmetry or Woodin's omega-logical axiom imply its inconsistency with the common framework in which it arises. Cohen's 1966 work on Set Theory and this introduced the method of forcing to show that no contradiction is introduced by including its negation with the ZF axioms and the axiom of choice, thus showing its truth to be undecidable by normal Zermelo-Frankel set theory.

answer: {Raman} effect or scattering

Three varieties of the diagnostic tool based on this phenomenon are ultraviolet resonance, near-infrared dispersive, and surface enhanced spectroscopy. It has been used in vivo to detect cervical and skin cancers by examining intensity changes and wavenumber shifts of the distinctly narrow peaks it creates. Because it is a fairly weak effect, sensitive detectors and laser sources must be used, and the much stronger fluorescence spectrum must be subtracted from the result. It occurs when a molecule enters a virtual excited state, then returns to a higher or lower vibrational state, emitting an altered photon. FTP, name this type of inelastic scattering that has both Stokes and anti-Stokes varieties and is named for an Indian physicist.

Brodsky and Berman determined this chemical's structure, which includes a sheath of stabilizing ordered water molecules. Due its dearth of cysteine residues, cross-linking of occurs near the N- and C-termini between lysine and histidine residues with the aid of lysyl oxidase. Ascorbate is dietarily necessary because it is needed by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase, which forms one of this molecule's prevalent residues. Consisting of over thirty distinct chains assembled into at least nineteen different varieties, the most common residue sequence is glycine-proline-hydroxyproline.

This belief took greatest hold in Soghdiana and was the state practice of the Uighurs. This creed's founder, known as the Apostle of Light, was revered for his painting for centuries after his death, and claimed especially to be the paraclete. Diocletian had mixed success in condemning its organizers and leaders “to the fire.” It held that all matter is corrupt and contains evil particles, so its initiated ate only fruit picked for them by those seeking initiation; a practice Augustine notes in the Confessions while discussing his flirtation with this religion. FTP, this syncretic, quasi-Christian dualistic religion founded by Manes.
