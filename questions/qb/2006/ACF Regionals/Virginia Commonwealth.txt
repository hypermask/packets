This chemical is transported bound to SHBG like estradiol. A noted teratogen, it can be excessively produced when tumors are present in the Leydig cells. It stimulates the secretion of inhibin from Sertoli cells, acts as the feedback inhibitor for LH and GnRH secretion, and causes the embryonic Wolffian ducts to become seminiferous tubules. FTP, name this hormone produced in the testicles that prompts vocal deepening, growth of facial hair, and development of sex organs in males.

answer: right to {trial} by {jury} (accept anything reasonable that mentions a {jury} or {juries})

Dice v. Akron held that it must be preserved when a state enforces a “federally created right,” an exception to the Minneapolis v. Bombolis decision which found that no such right exists in state-level civil actions. Strauder v. West Virginia applied the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this right's providence in ruling that race may not be a factor in its execution. Salinger v. Loisel addressed the requirement that the central body be locally drawn and numerous cases clarified their impartiality, a requirement typically addressed via voir dire testimony. FTP, name this right protected by the Sixth and Seventh Amendments which entitles a defendant to receive a verdict from a group of ordinary citizens.

answer: {Jebus}

According to the Old Testament, this name meaning “waterless hill” was used by the pre-Hebrew inhabitants of Jerusalem for the city. Its namesake tribe was the last conquered by Israel in Canaan and may have been the origin of such figures as Nathan and Zadok. More recently, someone by this name failed to respond to entreaties on a shortwave radio and the person behind that attempt declared non-belief in this entity when forced into missionary work to escape from a debt to the PBS pledge drive. FTP, name this botched pronunciation of the name of a major religious figure prayed to by Homer Simpson.

A change in their size can form breccia, gouge, or slickensides and, when two of the normal kind approach each other, a graben or horst may be created in between them. Types include thrust, transform dip-slip, oblique-slip, and strike-slip. FTP, plate boundaries are a common place to find what fractures in the crust, such as the New Madrid and San Andreas, where earthquakes usually occur?

Originally performed by Henri Akoka on clarinet, Étienne Pasquier on cello, and Jean Le Boulaire on violin along with the composer on piano, it is based on an announcement by an angel in chapter ten of Revelation.

The first victim of the 1848 revolution in Austria and staunch exponent of a European balance of power, he advocated the continental system at a meeting hosted in his nation following the Napoleonic Wars.

answer: the {Transamerica Pyramid} (or the {Transamerica} Tower)

The site that this building currently occupies was once the office of Sun Yat-Sen's Young China newspaper. Its exterior color is due to a coat of cast quartz applied to the building. Conceived by John R. Beckett after viewing trees in a public park, it was designed by the William Pereira firm which wanted to make it taller but were not allowed to break the line of sight between Nob Hill and the nearby bay. From the twenty-ninth floor to the top, elevators and a smoke tower are supported by the prominent “wings” and, until the construction of the Aon Center, it was the tallest building west of the Mississippi. FTP, name this building found in the Montgomery Financial District of San Francisco; the oddly shaped former headquarters of an American financial concern.

Precipitated by the arrival of a minister into town, the final descent into madness of Beret is accompanied by the belief that her son Peder Victorious will be her family's savior.

answer: {proscriptions} or {proscriptiones}

It first occurred after the Praeneste campaign at the urging of Valerius Flaccus and was announced in the Temple of Bellona. A later example was carried out by Quintus Pedius and Plutarch writes of it happening to the gentleman Quintus Aurelius. Descendants of anyone subjected to this procedure were barred from public office for two generations and Catiline became notorious for killing his brother-in-law in the one that happened in 82 BCE. Formulated during a Senate discussion between Gaius Metellus and Sulla, this activity returned during the Second Triumvirate, when Cicero fell victim to it. FTP, name this practice in which a Roman ruler posted lists of opponents to be stripped of property and killed.

answer: {index} of {refraction} (prompt on {n} or {eta})

The linear variation of this quantity with applied electric field is known as the Pockels effect and evanescence occurs when the magnitude of this physical quantity is dominated by the extinction coefficient. The path integral of this quantity is classically stationary according to Fermat's principle; a fact which may be used to derive the law of Snellius, which governs this property's namesake phenomenon at the interface of two media with different values for it. FTP, identify this physical property that is commonly defined as the ratio of the speed light in a medium to that in a vacuum.

answer: {Pentecost} (accept {Whitsunday} or {White Sunday} until “{white}” and prompt on it {afterward})

While its name is an alternative name for Hag Shavout, this Christian holiday itself has an alternative Anglican name referring to the color of the garments used for Baptism, but the liturgical calendar actually calls for red rather than white vestments. It is the anniversary of the “inauguration of the new age” and “fulfillment of the law” described in Acts. Occurring one week before the Feast of the Holy Trinity, it commemorates the appearance of the Holy Ghost to the disciples on the Sunday fifty days after Easter. FTP, name this Christian holiday which thus takes its name from the Greek for “fifty days” and plays a central role in the theology of a snake-handling, tongue-speaking namesake sect.

answer: the {Everglades}

The “chickee” house was engineered for use in this area, which is the home of the Miccosukee and borders the national parks of Fort Jefferson, Biscayne and Dry Tortugas. Areas of slightly higher elevation here are receptive to the growth of tropical trees such as cocoplum and mahogany, which mix with temperate vegetation in an arrangement found nowhere else in the United States. Among its endangered species are the wood stork, Atlantic leatherback turtle, and American crocodile; it is the only place where crocodiles co-exist with alligators. FTP, name this four thousand, three hundred square mile region bordering Big Cypress Swamp and Lake Okechobee; a grassy marshland that comprises a protected national park in Florida.
