answer: {clarinet}

Sometimes replaced by a violin in Glinka's Trio Pathetique, it was invented in the 1710's by Johann Christoph Denner and only became a staple of orchestras in the 1780's. Weber and Copland wrote concertos for it but the most famous is Mozart's in A major, which was his last major instrumental work. He and Brahms also wrote famous quintets for strings and this wind instrument, whose virtuosi include Gervase de Payer, David Shifrin and Sabine Meyer. FTP, Elaine's Bar on New York's Upper East Side is where you go to hear Woody Allen play what wind instrument tuned in B-flat and played with a single reed, whose famous jazz artists have included Woody Herman, Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman.

answer: the {Pantheon} (accept the {Church} of {Santa Maria Rotonda} or the {Church} of {Santa Maria ad Martyres} until mentioned)

This building contains the grave of its country's first king, who also has a grandiose monument in the same city that is colloquially referred to as “the typewriter.” It also contains the graves of an eighteenth-century composer of concerti grossi and a sixteenth-century painter. Its facade columns are disproportionately tall, apparently because its original planned height was greater than what was achieved. Still, its most famous feature was the largest of its kind in the world until 1436, when a structure in Florence surpassed it. FTP, the Church of Santa Maria ad Martyres is an alternate name for what structure on Rome's Piazza della Rotonda that was built first by Agrippa and then again by Hadrian as a temple to all the planetary deities of Rome?

answer: {Afonso} de {Albuquerque}, the {Great}

Towards the end of his career, he supposedly considered diverting the course of the Nile to destroy the power of Egypt. His poor health induced King Emmanuel to send Lope Suarez to succeed him. He made his first trip to Cochin in 1503 with his cousin Francisco and later commanded part of the fleet of Tristan da Cunha during the capture of Socotra. The second son of the lord of Villaverde, he became estribeiro-mor to King Joao II and was later given his command position by King Manuel I. In 1512, his ship, the Flor do Mar, was wrecked and his amassed treasure scattered, but he quickly rebounded to put down a revolt in Goa. FTP, name this Portuguese admiral and conqueror who shares his name with a city in New Mexico.

answer: magnetic {monopoles} (or magnetic charges)

They are admitted as topological defects, a special case of dyons, and are generally supermassive. One-dimensional analogues of cosmic strings, they were posited by Dirac to explain conservation of angular momentum and charge. Most grand unified theories predict their existence at a density such that a small loop of superconducting wire should be able to detect one per year, but none have been detected yet, even in searches of lunar rocks. They are classically forbidden, since the field they ostensibly generate must be divergence-free by Gauss' law for it. FTP, name these hypothetical charges; theoretical sources for the magnetic field.

answer: the {Second} Crusade

William of Tyre notably wrote about this engagement, discussing the difficult advance through narrow roads and orchards, and the desertion of the traitor princes. Otto of Friesing wrote about the failure of Prester John to come to the aid of the losing side and Osbernus described in detail the capture of Lisbon. Baldwin III received the invading army who then proceeded to meet at Acre and whose central leaders included Conrad III of Germany, who arrived in Jerusalem long before Louis VII. FTP, name this engagement prompted by the fall of Edessa and called by Pope Eugenius III; a crusade supported by Bernard of Clairvaux in which the Christian army was turned back from Damascus in 1154.

answer: {Nicolas Malebranche}

Condillac's Treatise on Sensations claims of this thinker that “his imagination had too much sway over him.” Bossuet referred to his system as “Beautiful, new, and false.” His 1709 “Responses” were to the pillory of Antoine Arnauld. He claimed that the Chinese were atheists, but was himself accused of pantheism by Jesuits, who banned publication of his Treatise of Nature and Grace. That work expanded upon his Search After Truth and Christian Meditations, both of which emphasize Cartesian dualism. FTP, name this French philosopher who attempted to reconcile Augustinian thought with Neoplatonism as the foremost proponent of occasionalism.

answer: {transition state} (accept {activated complex} before it's mentioned)

These correspond to first-order saddle points on reaction coordinate-potential surfaces, so they can be located by optimizing the potential energy of the corresponding quantum system. Positronium acts as one of these for the annihilation reaction of anti-electrons. For an Arrhenius reaction, the rate is proportional to the negative exponential of the enthalpy required to form it, which is known as the activation energy. Often denoted with a star to indicate that it is energetic, ideal irreversible reactions always go to completion on reaching it, and its structure resembles that of the reaction species closest to it in free energy according to the Hammond postulate. FTP, name this point in a reaction, the structure of which is the activated complex.

answer: {Civilization} and its {Discontents}

The author of this work claims that Jews interpreted their misfortune as the consequence of their own sinfulness and created a set of overly strict commandments in reaction to their fate. The author disputes the idea that new technology automatically improves quality of life and critiques communism based on the inability to reform human nature in order to eliminate all motivation for the exploitation associated with capitalism. Major themes include the restraint of instinctual aggression, the concept of a “death drive,” and the threats posed by conscience and guilt. It ends by questioning which force will prevail, “eternal Eros” or his potent adversary. FTP, name this essay by Sigmund Freud about the titular misery-causing society and the people who hate it.

answer: {manifolds}

Spivak's definition requires that they admit a metric, but this is not really necessary for most purposes. The Nash embedding theorem states that those having metric tensors can be isometrically embedded in Euclidean space. They are typically required to be Hausdorff and second countable, but must always be locally Euclidean. The differentiable type has smooth transition maps, unlike the topological version, and the Riemannian type has a metric tensor. The Poincaré conjecture states that all simply connected closed examples of these in 3-space are homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. FTP, name these mathematical objects coverable by many open sets homeomorphic to Euclidean space; generalizations of surfaces.

answer: nuclear {fission}

For a homogenous system, the ratio of the rate of this reaction to that of absorption is the thermal utilization f, which is one of the factors in the four-factor formula. Solid-state actinide detectors for very-high-energy photons use the gamma-induced variety of this reaction. Plotted against atomic number, its usual yield curve is normally hollow, double-humped and symmetric, but can shift right if the inducing particles are highly energetic. It is energetically favorable to the right of iron-56 so power generation methods utilizing it use heavy elements like thorium as fuel. FTP, name this nuclear reaction often accompanied by release of energy and neutrons; the break-up of large nuclei into smaller ones, discovered by Hahn and Meitner.
