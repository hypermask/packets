answer: The {Art} of the {Fugue} or {Die Kunst der Fuge}

Herman Scherchen and Wolfgang Graeser both arranged this work for orchestra, since the composer did not specify on what instrument it was to be performed. Its first published version included a chorale attached by the composer's son, entitled “Here Before Thy Throne I Stand.” The last of its four canons is augmented in retrograde motion, while the second is written for two voices separated by an octave. These canons connect the main movements, the sixth of which is “in the French style,” and the last of which was left unfinished at the composer's death, ending on a motif that spells out his name. FTP, name this composition which consists of fourteen Contrapuncti, written by J.S. Bach.

answer: {Bernoulli's} equation

This relation's namesake constant must generally be computed for each streamline because it is derived by line-integrating the momentum equation along a streamline with the proper assumptions, the most restrictive of which is the absence of friction. Dividing through by the acceleration of gravity reformulates this equation in terms of head, which is how it's commonly used in civil engineering, and it can be used to derive the Venturi principle. It can be quickly obtained by dividing the energy equation for an ideal fluid element by its volume. FTP, name the equation that states that the sum of static and dynamic pressures and specific gravitational potential is constant and is named after a Swiss physicist.

answer: Epistle of Paul to the {Romans}

The last chapter of this book contains greetings to Andronicus and Junias, the author's relatives, and a greeting from Tertius, who transcribed it. Chapter eleven compares the audience to broken shoots being grafted onto a tree. Although chapter two is cited to support salvation by virtue, verses such as 10:13, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved,” seem to support salvation by faith alone. Its most popular verses include 3:23, “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;” and 6:23, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.” FTP, name this book of the New Testament, the longest of Paul's epistles, which he addressed to a church in Italy.

The play opens in Johnny “the Priest's” bar, whose denizens include two nameless longshoremen and Marthy Owen, who courts the title character's father. In Act III, two central characters coincidentally sign up for the same steamer to Cape Town, the Londonberry, but confront each other aboard the Simeon Winthrop before departing.

answer: {Parmenides} of Elea

Davidson's translations of this man's greatest work states that the path “that Being is not, and Non-Being must be” is “all-incredible” because “one thing are Thinking and Being.” Citing Tartarus as a muse, he is featured in Kingsley's In the Dark Places of Wisdom, which describes a conspiracy to cover-up his writings. He believed that doxa is fundamentally mistaken, and that reality is a united and indestructible single alethia, hence his vehement opposition to Heraclitus. In the Platonic dialogue named for him, he proposes the “third man argument,” which undermines the theory of forms, and his disciple Zeno attacks the notions of plurality and motion. FTP, name this pre-Socratic philosopher, author of the poem On Nature and the founder of the Eleatic school.

answer: Johnny David {Damon}

In high school home games in 1992, he was announced as “the nation's number one player on the nation's number one team.” As a minor leaguer in 1993, he was in a commercial with George Brett. He led the American League in 2000 in runs scored and steals, but was traded west the next year. A widespread rumor claiming that he'd failed a steroids test in 2005 was found to be false, though he did play for Oakland after being traded from Kansas City. He helped defeat the team he recently joined by hitting a grand slam in Game Seven of the 2004 ALCS while the Red Sox center fielder and leadoff man.

This person was identified with Hittite Aqhat, who refused to yield his bow to Anatha. Conceived when the bee-keeper Hyreius made water on the hide of a bull and buried it in his wife's grave, he was compelled to carry Cedalion to the edge of the Earth in penance for raping Oenopion's daughter Merope, for only then would Helios restore his sight. Some myths claim that Aesclepius was struck dead while trying to revive this man. Apollo fooled Artemis into believing this man had seduced Opos as Candaon, so she had his struck down while he was swimming near Ortygia; later ruing this decision, she flung her assassin into the sky along with this man and his dog. FTP, name this hunter who is constantly being pursued by a scorpion and who had a dog named Sirius.

answer: The {Protestant Ethic} and the {Spirit} of {Capitalism}

Chapter five of this work begins with a discussion of the work of Richard Baxter and the notion of Anschauung, or “outlook,” and goes on to discuss the controversy in Britain over the Book of Sport. In Chapter two, the author criticizes economic rationalism as a response to economic traditionalism, focusing on Benjamin Franklin's claim that “time is money.” In Part II, the author moves on to critique the vocational rigidity of several ascetic groups. The work's central claim is that the “vocational calling,” combined with moral self-discipline, fueled and ossified the modern economic state, forming a “steel-hard casing” from which we cannot escape. FTP, name this seminal work of sociology in which Calvinism was linked to free enterprise by Max Weber.

answer: “Adonais”

The thirtieth stanza of this work describes a “Pilgrim of Eternity, whose fame / Over his living head like Heaven is bent,” while the next three stanzas are an extended description of the author, whose “branded and ensanguined brow” was “like Cain's or Christ's.” The poet instructs a “noteless blot” to “Live though, whose infamy is not thy fame!” referencing a critic whom he blames for the death of the title character, whose soul “like a star, / Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.” The poet repeatedly exhorts the reader to “weep for” the title character “for he is dead” and declares that “his fate and fame shall be / An echo and a light unto Eternity.” FTP, what is this elegy on the death of John Keats by Percy Bysshe Shelley?

One of this location's features, Gipul Catena, is an almost six hundred twenty-kilometer-long straight line of craters, and its magnetic field is generated by rapid circulation of a large electrolyte flow beneath its surface, making it strong enough to be detectable even in the larger fields of nearby bodies. As it has almost no geological activity, it has the oldest and most cratered surface in the solar system. Many of its features are named after Norse mythology, as exemplified by the impact craters Valhalla and Asgard. It is the third-largest moon in the solar system and is farther away from Jupiter than the other Galilean moons. FTP, name this moon named after a nymph Zeus loved who was transformed into a bear.
