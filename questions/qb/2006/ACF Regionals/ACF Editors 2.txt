answer: {Suetonius} (or {Suetonii})

A man from this family with the cognomen Laetus was a Hippo Regian knight in the service of Otho. A Paulinus of this gens was governor of Britain during Boudicea's revolt. The most famous man of this name was dismissed from secretarial service due to a mutual disgust for Vibia Sabina after having been aided into Imperial favor by Pliny the Younger. His once-popular Prata has not survived and, though he's often considered the least rhetorical of the Silver Age authors, he recalls Julius Hyginus in his De Grammaticis. FTP, name this family of Romans whose most famous member, with cognomen Tranquillus, was the author of De viris illustribus and De vita Caesarum, The Lives of the Caesars.

answer: {Duino Eligies} or {Duineser Elegien}

A seminal translation of these was made in the APR by Poulin in 1975. Claiming of “the hero” that he “strangely resembles those who die young,” the sixth of these nevertheless notes “Thousands fermented in [his mother's] womb, wanting to be him.” The fourth begins by asking the “trees of life, when is [their] winter?” The fifth is “dedicated to Frau Hertha von Koenig,” while this work as a whole is “property of Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis-Hohenlohe,” who is also dedicatee of The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge. They are named for the Swiss town in a tower in which they were composed and the poet calls The Sonnets to Orpheus their “natural overflow.” FTP, name this volume of ten poems by Rainer Maria Rilke.

answer: the War of the {Triple Alliance}

In this engagement's fourth year, one of its central figures was replaced by the duque de Caxias and a key turning point was the destruction of a flotilla near Corrientes, at Riachuelo. After the fall of Humaitá, this conflict culminated with the Campaign of Lomas Valentinas in which the army assembled by Bartolomé Mitre forced Francisco Solano López to run to the hills in the North, where he was killed in 1870. FTP, name this 1864-1870 conflict, the bloodiest in the history of South America; a war fought between Paraguay and the namesake entity consisting of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.

answer: planarity

The first polynomial-time test for this property was written by Shih and Hsu in 1999, but it is still outperformed by the 1974 algorithm of Hopcroft and Tarjans in many cases. A famous instructive example regarding this, the Petersen star, does not possess it because removing an outer vertex creates an object homeomorphic to K-three-three. Kuratowski's theorem given the necessary and sufficient conditions for it to hold for a graph and every graph with this property is four-colorable by the four-color theorem. FTP, name this property of graphs that may be unambiguously embedded on a surface, or drawn without crossing a line or lifting the drawing implement.

answer: {Cyrano} de {Bergerac}

Its author dedicates this work to the soul of Coquelin, which he claims is the main character's. Opening at the Hôtel de Bourgogne, this drama has several lines for the orange girl, who finds it difficult to please Lignière. The title character is presumed lost at the end of the fourth act after leading “men so fond of death,” the Cadets of Gascoyne, who are stationed at the Castel-Jaloux. The central ruse is uncovered when the female lead notices that the title character is able to read a faded letter ostensibly from Christian de Neuvillette that she's kept in a silk bag around her neck. FTP, name this work with a title character who's based on the author of A Voyage to the moon and who loves Roxane; a play by Edmund Rostand.

answer: {Born} approximations

Considering a point of far beyond the scattering interaction range in the zeroth of these approximations yields the asymptotic boundary condition used by the method of partial waves, an alternative to them. The incident and zeroth-order waves are defined as Laplacian eigenfunctions. The key to deriving these is regarding the integral of the unknown state function as an inhomogeneous term, as this yields a Friedholm integral equation of the second kind. That integral equation is equivalent to the Schrödinger equation for scattering in a two-particle system, for which these approximations iteratively determine the wavefunction. FTP, name this series of successive approximations from the quantum theory of scattering, named for a German physicist.

The creator of inada, the sight of this creature at birth was unbearable, which lead to banishment via the Celestial Ladder. This deity's main holy place, which contains a mirror in its inner sanctum and is pulled-down and rebuilt every two decades, is at Ise-Jingue. Enraged by the noise of her brother, she had to be lured from hiding by the antics of Uzume. As Tamayori is the son of Owatatsumi, her brother, Jimmu is a lineal, not direct descendant of this goddess. With a name meaning “shining heaven,” this eldest daughter of Izanagi and Izanami is antagonistic to Susanowa. FTP, name this Shinto goddess of the sky and sun.

answer: All for {Love}; or the {World Well Lost}

The preface to this work likens it to a try at the “bow of Ulysses” as the “subject… has been treated by the greatest wits of our nation,” while its prologue likens critics to “vultures… gaping for the carcase of a play!” As it opens, Serapion tells a nightmare he's had to Myris but this is overheard near the temple of Isis. After a flourish at the beginning of Act III, Scene 1, the female lead crowns the male who responds by calling her his “brighter Venus!” Her offstage suicide in Act V, Scene 2, is communicated to him in Alexas' “Sir, she is gone.” FTP, name this blank verse drama based on Antony and Cleopatra; the greatest tragedy of John Dryden, which describes what the main characters sacrifice in the title phrase.

answer: {cynicism}

This system's chief objective of autarkeia is open to wide interpretation, as is its chief virtue, anaideia, but the means for attaining them, askesis, is well-defined. Sayre argues that this sect did not arise until the second century BCE but it claims descent from Socrates. Seeking a “natural life” by “defacing the currency” through parrhesia, this philosophy's practitioners valued shamelessness and self-sufficiency over all else and the shocking qualities of their lectures led to their being labeled as barking “dogs.” FTP, name this school of philosophy usually considered to have been founded Antisthenes, who claimed that “nothing exists,” but which is best exemplified by Diogenes of Sinope.

Their namesake value is the mass iodine equivalent of maleic anhydride used per unit mass of sample undergoing maleic hydride addition. Danishefsky's namesake one of these chemicals, H4C4Me4SiO2, produces a heterocyclic ring in the reaction named for it. This class of chemicals is especially amenable to Ziegler-Natta polymerization with cross-linking and allenes are a type of the less-common cumulated variety of them. The three varieties are classified by bond separation; the two most common are the unconjugated and conjugated varieties, of which the 1,3-buta- type is the simplest. FTP, name these hydrocarbons containing at least two double bonds, the conjugated type of which undergo Diels-Alder reactions.

answer: {Reflections} on the Revolution in {France}

The beginning of this work is notably anti-Semitic and draws a distinction between the author's home and the one addressed by discussing the case of “Lord George Gordon fast in Newgate.” Calling nobility “the Corintian capital of a polished society,” this work's political philosophy is centered on the idea that, as the people are “prejudiced,” any government not taking advantage of their ignorance is doomed to instability. It was closely followed by An Appeal and by Paine's Rights of Man, which is a response to it. FTP, name this early work of social history which was originally addressed to Charles-Jean-François Depont, “a very young gentlemen in Paris;” a lengthy letter about the French Revolution by Edmund Burke.

answer: {divergence} theorem (accept {Gauss}' {theorem} before it's mentioned; accept {Ostrogradsky's theorem} or {Ostrogradsky}-{Gauss theorem} or {Gauss}-{Ostrogradsky theorem})

A velocity-space generalization of this lemma is used to take moments of the Boltzmann equation, because it trivially shows that the velocity-space integral of the distribution function under the namesake operation in velocity space vanishes. A special case of the generalized Stokes theorem for a Hodge-starred exterior derivative, it can be used to reduce by one the dimensionality of the set over which a scalar field is integrated as long as that scalar field can be expressed as a vector field under the namesake operation.

This pathway's first enzyme, a transcarbomylase, requires an input of carbomyl phosphate. The synthetase at this pathway's antepenultimate step requires aspartate, which is dehydrated and combined with citrulline. Sometimes called the Krebs-Henseleit cycle, it requires three ATP, which it reduces to two ADP and an AMP. This double-celled cycle regenerates its required fumarate from arginosuccinate, after which arginase produces its namesake compound.

Kaiser's similarly titled 1963 work on this book is frequently referenced in Clarence Miller's important 1979 translator's introduction to it. After attacking the distinction between grace gratis data and grace gratificans, this work challenges the authority of the Speculum maius and Gesta Romanorum. It is often published today with a letter defending it to Martin Dorp. Claiming that worshipers of Saints Barbara, George, Hippolytus and the author's namesake are “closely related [to gamblers],” who engage in the title action, the narrator herself concludes that activity by noting that she “hate[s] a listener with a memory.” FTP, name this 1511 religious tract; the best known work of Desiderius Erasmus.
