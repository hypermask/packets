answer: the {writing} on the {wall} or {Mene Mene Tekel Parsin} (accept {Belshazzar's feast} before {Belshazzar})

The originator of this legend may have been Heliodorus, the chancellor of Seleucus IV Philopatorm, who was prevented by the priest Onias from looting the Temple. A similar story from a cuneiform tablet lends veracity to this legend, which is set during the years following the victory at Carchemish by Nebuchadnezzar. Three Talmudic units of weight, the peras, shekel, and mina, have been hypothesized to be represented. After “the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone” are praised at a banquet, the central event occurs and the inability to vocalize three verbs meaning “to count,” “to weigh,” and “to divide” render an inscription undecipherable. Depicted in the fifth chapter of Daniel, this is, FTP, what harbinger that, according to the prophet, foretold the downfall of King Belshazzar of Babylon?

answer: {Payne}-{Aldrich} Tariff

Passed three years after the Moro Rebellion, this bill attempted to appease Filipinos by loosening restrictions on the importation of hemp and sugar. Referred to as “the best bill the Republican Party ever passed,” it would ironically lead to the election of a Democrat after a party split. The bill's Senatorial sponsor won support by pandering to anti-trust sentiment through a hike in rates on urban products, including those from his home state of Rhode Island. Signed into law against the wishes of Robert Lafollette by William Howard Taft, this is, FTP, what 1909 Tariff that lowered Dingley rates and the rates of which were later lowered by the Underwood Tariff?

answer: {alpha} particles

In 1978, DRAM soft errors in Intel chips were linked to these entities. Created in the fifth step of the proton-proton cycle, their production is modeled by preformation and tunneling in the Gammow model of their namesake decay. In 1908, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden incorrectly hypothesized that their angular deflection would be approximately one-one-hundredth of a degree in a certain experiment; three years later Geiger and J. M. Nuttall noted the empirical relationship between their kinetic energies and half lives. FTP, name this ionizing form of radiation that was deflected in Rutherford's gold foil experiment; free helium-four nuclei.

answer: William {Shakespeare}

Thomas Nashe's Pierce Pennilesse included an allusion to Talbot, the hero of one of this author's lesser-known works. That work included the line “O, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide” which was used in Groatsworth of Wit by Robert Greene, who criticized the author as an “upstart crow beautified with our feathers.” This critique was not unfounded, as the author later directly adapted Greene's Pandosto into work featuring Florizel, the prince of Bohemia. Florizel is in love with the daughter of the King of Siciliy whose maid's husband is the subject of the stage direction, “Exit, pursued by a bear.” FTP, name this Elizabethan playwright known for his prodigious output including Henry VI and The Winter's Tale.

answer: “No {Woman}, No {Cry}”

In one Friends episode, Monica has a bathroom mishap while singing this song whose royalties support the soup kitchen alluded to in its lyrics. Though a live version is now most often played, the original, with background vocals by the I-Threes, was featured on the Natty Dread album. After a long night, the artist recalls cooking cornmeal porridge by “fire light.” He mentions the Yoruban goddess Oba, observes the hypocrites as they “mingle with the good people we meet...the good friends we've lost” and notes “in this great future, you can't forget your past.” Taking its title from a Jamaican manner of consoling, this is, FTP, what Bob Marley song whose female object, after being assured that “Everything's gonna be all right!” is urged “little darlin', don't shed no tears?”

While attending a feast hosted by Cybele on Mt. Ida, this deity fell asleep and was nearly violated by Priapus, but the braying of an ass woke her up and saved her. Considered both the youngest and oldest of the gods, since Cronus swallowed her first and disgorged her last, she caused a great rift between Apollo and Poseidon when she was asked by both of them to be their bride. But she refused both of them, taking a vow in front of her brother Zeus to remain pure. FTP, name this goddess whose symbol was the circle whose duties included tending the sacred fire on Mt. Olympus.

A Guido Reni rendition of the archangel Michael was based on the features of this pontiff whose sister-in-law, Olympia Maidalchini, wielded influence in his court. During the seventeenth century, the dukes of Parma waged the Wars of Castro against his family and that of his predecessor, Barberini. Originally, he was elected as a compromise against the candidate put forth by Mazarin, with whom he bickered almost continuously for the eleven-year duration of his papacy. He issued the Bull Zelo Domus Dei in protest against the French-negotiated provisions of the Peace of Westphalia.

answer: {saponification}

This reaction involves a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate which is created by a nucleophilic addition of a hydroxide to a carbonyl group. The intermediate becomes a carboxylate ion which is protanated by addition of aqueous mineral acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Completed in a basic solution, its namesake constant indicates the amount of lye required to facilitate the breaking of ester linkages. That constant is 0.1330 for avocado and sesame seed; the relative amount of potassium hydroxide needed for them to undergo this process. FTP, name this triglyercide hydrolysis which takes its name from its use in the manufacture of soap.

After a scene in which the protagonist falls comatose on the floor, he is kissed by his seventeen-year-old crush and told “Run on, little brother.” The events of the novel all take place in a single March day in 1935, the protagonist's fourteenth birthday. That morning he awakes, watches a movie, and comes home to find that his stepbrother has been stabbed. Likened by the author to Noah's son Ham, the protagonist is disliked by his father who sees in him the now-deceased son Royal, whom he abandoned. The novel's second section, “Prayers of the Saints,” tells the history of members of the central family including that of the stepfather, Gabriel, who, after being “blood-washed,” becomes a preacher.

answer: the {Louisiana Purchase}

In the year prior to this agreement, Alexandre Pétion and Jean-Jacques Dessalines defected from army posts and England broke a promise made in the Peace of Amiens to evacuate Malta. The negotiations for it occurred in the wake of the Treaty of San Ildefonso, the exact provisions of which were in dispute until the Transcontinental Treaty of 1819. Lacking sufficient military force to secure his foreign territories, the emperor looked to extend the right of deposit established by Treaty of Madrid. Completed by ambassadors Robert Livingston and James Monroe, this is, FTP, what Franco-American agreement of 1803 which facilitated the transfer of more than five hundred million acres?

answer: the {Wallace} line

T.H. Huxley first coined the name of this feature, which is partially due to accretions during the tertiary period. It is contiguous with the Makassar Straits after which it turns forty-five degrees, continuing almost due East, North of the Spice Islands. At its Western extent, it cuts the Malay Peninsula between Lombock and Bali. The feature shares its name with Rhacophorus nigropalmatus, one of the species which Darwin's predecessor used during the 1850's to explain the lack of some oriental species South of about ten degrees South latitude. FTP, name this line; the hypothetical boundary between the zoogeographical regions of Asia and Australasia.

answer: {Branganza} (or {Bragança})

The movement which led to a daughter branch of this dynasty was inspired by the Cry of Ypiranga. Thirteen years after its initiation, that branch was rocked by the War of Tatters, in which one side was led by Giuseppe Garibaldi and which hastened the ascension of its founder's five-year-old son. The founder returned to his home nation and fought the War of the Two Brothers to return his daughter to the parent nation's throne. That parent dynasty was a collateral line of the House of Aviz, which ruled until the Habsburgs seized its throne in 1580. Sixty years later, John IV wrested that throne from the control of Phillip II, while it was John VI who sent his son, Pedro, to initiate a daughter line in Brazil. FTP, name this royal house of Portugal.

answer: {surjectiveness} (or {onto})

A corollary of the Lyusternik theorem is that, at a certain point, the Frechet derivative of the map between Banach spaces has this property. According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, either the adjoint of a continuous linear operator with a closed range has a non-trivial kernel or the operator is of this type. More generally, a function is said to have this property if and only if the composition of it and its inverse is everywhere the identity function. Only applicable to functions whose domain spans the entire codomain, this is, FTP, what property, functions having which are bijective only if they are also injective?

One logical positivist derided emotivism as a “Boo Hurrah theory” of this field while, in the Provincial Letters, Pascal attacked casuistic approaches to it. G.E. Moore elucidated the naturalistic fallacy, which occurs when approaches to it appeal to some definition of a certain “indefinable” construct, which Henry Sidgwick considered across three primitive paradigms of the field. Kant's categorical imperative is hailed as the most reasonable approach in deontology, a stance that John Rawls clarified by defining with respect to justice and right the construct of good.

answer: the {Fourth} Crusade

During this conflict, one of the leaders used the island of Lido as a prison for those in his debt. The course of the war was altered by a meeting in Hagenau between Phillip Hohenstaufen and Boniface of Montferratt; their decision eventually led to the deposition of the “bushy-eyebrowed” Alexius V and the subsequent ascension of the Latin Empire. Earlier, Simon de Montfort had deserted the effort after he refused the overtures of Enrico Dandolo to sack a Dalmatian city. Originally aimed at conquering Egypt, this is, FTP, what war, which saw the first sack of Constantinople and a repeat of the failure of Frederick Barbarossa and Richard the Lion-Hearted to take Jerusalem?

The characteristic communitas, which was influenced by Robert Merton's definition of society as “patterned,” was attributed to Ndembu practitioners of this anthropological phenomenon in works such as The Drums of Affliction and The Forest of Symbols. The term for it was first used by Arnold van Gennep, whose work in rural France formed the basis of a model with three-phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation. In the previously named works, Victor Turner elucidated theories to explain the process of first humiliating, secluding, or testing before allowing a new societal role to be taken. Exemplified by the Norwegian russefeiring, Lakota vision quest, and Jewish Bar Mitzvah, this is, FTP, what phrase used to refer to any ritual symbolizing a change in status?

answer: Claude {Debussy}

After this composer “discovered” Boris Godunov, he adopted Balakirev's time signatures for an orchestral triptych and employed a women's chorus for its third section, “Sirens.” Two trips to Bayreuth influenced him and he parodied Wagner's “Tristan chord” in the “Golliwog's Cakewalk” section of one his Children's Corner Suites. His friend Gustave Doré conducted the premier of a well-known piece which was intended as the first of another triptych and which, according to Pierre Boulez, marked the beginning of modern music. That work's first section is dominated by the flute, which represents the title animal from a Mallarme poem. FTP, name this French composer of Three Nocturnes and Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.
