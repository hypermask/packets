answer: {prophase} I (prompt on {prophase}; prompt on {meiosis} until “{second}”)

In Arabidopsis, a crucial function of the first part of this period seems to be controlled by SOLO DANCERS. In the Xenophus model species, Chk1 kinase arrests oocyte development at this point. Secondary replication occurs during its second sub-phase and it terminates with attachment of non-kinetochore microtubules. Divided into leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene sub-phases, this phase ends with diakinesis. During it, the process of synapsis is completed, homologous chromosomes join into tetrads, and crossing-over takes place. FTP, name the phase followed by metaphase I; the first stage of meiosis.

answer: “The {Flea}”

In the book in which it appears, it precedes a poem in which the author wishes that anyone who “guesses, thinks, or dreams” he knows who the author's mistress is be withered by a curse. In the second stanza of this poem, the author asks that “self murder” and “sacrilege” not be added to a woman's sins. The title creature is meant to show “how little that which” a woman denies to the poet is, and is said to be both a “marriage temple” and a “marriage bed,” while the poet and a woman are met “and cloistered” and “living walls of jet.” FTP, name this poem about a creature which sucked a woman and then sucked John Donne, thereby mingling two bloods.

answer: {Bar}-{Kochba's Rebellion} (accept {Bar}-{Kochba's Revolt})

It initially experienced success when Tinius Rufus decided to evacuate a major city, after which Julius Severus was brought in to oppose it. Its causes included the creation of a new coin that showed a certain province as a woman taken prisoner and a plan to build a new city called Aelia Capitolina. In its aftermath, a group of wise men who had supported it were executed, after which they became known as the Ten Martyrs. Its namesake leader had a name meaning “son of a star” though his advisor, Rabbi Akiba, announced that he was the anointed king. FTP, name this uprising against Roman rule which began in 132 CE, when Jewish rebels captured Jerusalem.

answer: {Spike} (accept {William})

In one episode, this character was called “the Doctor” and his scheme to sell some dangerous eggs went awry when he forgot to keep them refrigerated. In another episode, he went to Los Angeles to retrieve a powerful ring that had been taken from him, but it ended up in the hands of a torturer he had hired to ascertain its location. He killed a number of people due to brainwashing triggered by the song “Early One Morning,” but it was defused after he fought Robin Wood. He slept with Anya after she was left at the altar by Xander, and died while using a powerful amulet that enabled him to save the world in the final episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. FTP, name this peroxided character played by James Marsters.

answer: The {Analects} of Confucius (or {Lun} yü)

In the 18th book of this work, we learn that the central figure got down from his carriage in hopes of speaking to a madman, but the latter avoided a conversation by hurrying away. That book also includes a list of “men who withdrew from society” and an episode where the central figure announces that “one cannot associate with birds and beasts.” In the 20th and final book, we learn that a man who embraces the five excellent practices can take part in government. Along with the other Sishu, this book was published by Zhu Xi in 1190 and consists of remarks compiled after a sage died in 479 BCE. FTP, name this Chinese classic containing the sayings of Confucius.

answer: {Claisen} condensation (or {Claisen} reaction)

This procedure was first published with Claparede in 1881 in two forms, the second for a hydroxyl-substituted benzene. As performed today, it usually requires an initial acylation but, even with this, the relevant methanoate derivatives are notably unable to carry out the self- form of this reaction. One of the reactants contains a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl; a deprotonation occurs at this site in the first step and the resulting conjugated system attacks the other reactant, an ester. It requires a strong base catalysis, so the relevant alkoxide is often added to the system. FTP, name this reaction of two esters to yield a beta-keto ester; a condensation named for a German chemist.

answer: Thomas {Pinckney} (prompt on {Pinckney})

He used the pseudonym Achates in writing a pamphlet in response to the slave rebellion led by Denmark Vesey. In the War of 1812 he was appointed Major General and given command of the southern district, and later commanded military forces during the Creek War, as well as negotiating the treaty that ended it. He was the Federalist choice for Vice President in 1796, having been selected as their candidate while he was in Europe negotiating a treaty with the so-called “Prince of Peace,” Godoy, which provided for free navigation of the Mississippi River. FTP, name this politician from South Carolina who negotiated the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo with Spain; a treaty also known by his name.

answer: {Peterloo} Massacre

A few minutes before William Fildes was killed, Charles Ethelston took action from Mr. Buxton's house. A year after it took place, Arthur Thistlewood led a group that planned an attack on a party at Lord Harrowby's house, though they were arrested at their house in Cato Street before anyone could be killed. The Earl of Liverpool's government responded to it by passing the repressive Six Acts. It took place on August 16, when an attempt to arrest Henry Hunt went awry and eleven people were killed. FTP, name this event in Manchester at which a crowd gathered to hear a lecture on Parliamentary reform was attacked, a “massacre” of 1819.

answer: culture

Leslie White suggested that the product of technical factor efficiency and per capita energy consumption is an appropriate quantitative measure of the “evolution” of this concept, which, according to another scientist, is best explained in terms of “webs of significance.” Those “webs” are best “interpreted” through “thick description” of “deep play” such as the Balinese cock fight according to Cliffy Geertz. A 1944 essay by Bronislaw Malinowski offered a “scientific theory” of it, while a 1934 book about it considers such groups as the Kwakiutl and Zuni. FTP, name this concept whose “patterns” were discussed by Ruth Benedict.

answer: {Lepiduses} (or {Lepidi})

One man of this name was put to death along with the poet Lentulus Gaeticulus after conspiring to assassinate his brother-in-law. That man was married to Drusilla, the sister of the man who eventually had him killed, Caligula. Another man of this name made an unsuccessful assassination attempt in 30 BCE, becoming the first man to try to murder an Emperor when he failed to kill Augustus. The most famous man of this name served as consul in 46 BCE before becoming pontifex maximus and, after the battle of Mutina, he joined with Mark Antony to march on Rome. FTP, name these Romans, the last of whom later assisted Octavian against Pompey as the third member of the Second Triumvirate.
