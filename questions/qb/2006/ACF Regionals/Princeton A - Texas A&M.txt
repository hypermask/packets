answer: {dynamo} (accept word forms, {e.g. dynamic})

Cowling proved that a fluid, self-sustaining one of these cannot have an axis of symmetry, though Braginsky's isothermal solution to the 3-D problem of this name is nearly symmetric. Steenbeck's alpha effect is the production of a time-averaged field of this type by disordered MHD convection. Parker proposed that rising flows in the Sun's atmosphere could give rise to a field of this type, but this model does not account for the properties of sunspots. The Gramme electromagnetic variety of this uses a ring armature to increase consistency while Pixii built the first electric one based on Faraday's law of induction. FTP, identify the shared name of the most prevalent model of planetary magnetism and an electrical generator that converts rotation to alternating current.

An early theory of the origin of these involved the breakup of relativistic “beebees” while Meszaros and Rees proposed the relativistic fireball shock model to explain their non-thermal broken power law spectrum. Woosely and Paczynski proposed that they are explicable by the collapsar model for Wolf-Rayet stars, which form black holes that feed an electron-positron-baryon jet. First detected by Vela military satellites, their afterglow was first observed by the BeppoSAX satellite using an x-ray detector and data from NASA's Compton Observatory showed they originate from far outside the Milky Way. FTP, identify these astronomical phenomena classified either as long- or short-duration depending if they last over two seconds and named for their intense output of high-energy photons.

answer: {abscisic} acid (or {abscissin}; accept {dormin} before it's mentioned)

First characterized in 1963, this hormone consists of a sesquiterpenoid partially produced through the mevalonic acid pathway. Its active form is produced by oxidation of a product of violaxanthin breakdown, ABA aldehyde. Its production is stimulated by stresses and its transport occurs in a non-polar manner through both xylem and phloem with translocation through parenchymal cells. Major effects include inhibiting shoot growth with a minimal effect on root growth, inducing seeds to synthesize storage proteins, and inducing gene transcription for proteinase inhibitors in response to wounding. FTP, name this plant hormone once known as dormin for its induction and maintenance of dormancy and best known for its role in the dehiscence of fruits and the falling of leaves.

answer: {Mach} number

For a small body moving in an otherwise quiescent fluid, the inclination of the boundary between the zones of silence and action is the arcsine of one over this property of the flow. This parameter arises in the boundary layer equation from the natural scaling of the dependent variable and a necessary condition for potential flow is that this parameter be much smaller than unity. Since this dimensionless parameter is the ratio of the effects of inertial and elastic forces, flows are incompressible when it is small. FTP, identify the dimensionless number that is the ratio of the speed of an object in a fluid medium to the speed of sound in that medium.

answer: the {Wagner} Act (or the {National} Labor {Relations} Act)

The precursor to this legislation, Resolution 44, employed John Carmody and Edwin Smith, who also served in the later incarnation of the organization that this Act created. It was called unconstitutional by the American Liberty League and, in a Supreme Court case, Jones and Laughlin Steel claimed that it was not consistent with the commerce clause, but Chief Justice Hughes sided with the government. Passed after the failure of the NRA, it applied to all employers except those in agriculture, airlines, railroads, and government, but many of its powers were nullified by the Landrum-Griffin and Taft-Hartley Acts. FTP name this legislation sponsored by a senator from New York; a 1935 Act that established workers' right to collective bargaining and created a namesake board of labor.

answer: {SN1} (accept {unimolecular nucleophilic substitution} or {first}-{order nucleophilic substitution} before the end)

In order to explain this mechanism's normal result, Winstein has proposed that the presence of ion pairs hinders complete racemization from it. Strong leaving groups like tosylates increase the rate of reactions of this type, but nucleophile concentration changes have no effect on it. Proceeding in two steps, it works best with tertiary alkyl halides and proceeds more rapidly in aprotic solutions. Its rate determined by the dissociation of the substrate, which results in the formation of a carbocation and is unimolecular. FTP, identify this reaction mechanism; a first-order nucleophilic substitution.
