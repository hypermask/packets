answer: {bubble} chambers

COUPP proposes to use these to search for WIMPs. There are proposals to use them as breeding blankets for fusion devices as they sometimes contain dense deuterium. These devices have no direct energy spectroscopy, but have a lower refresh time and higher reactant density than their predecessors. They work by changing the pressure in a tank, which causes its contents to become superheated; charges moving in the detector volume then create the namesake objects. FTP, identify these devices largely replaced by spark chambers, used to detect charged particles, and invented in 1952 by Donald Glaser.

answer: {ribosomes} (accept 50S ribosomal subunits or large ribosomal subunits until “strands”)

The first atomic structure of one of these was published by Ban et al. in 2000. Its leading end is labeled P and is followed by A. In prokaryotes, it is made of three strands and consists of 30S and 50S subunits; in eukaryotes it has four strands. It uses an initiator called fMET and then works by using peptidyl transferase to bind two amino acids, creating a peptide bond; it does this by reading mRNA and using tRNA to create its product. FTP, these, sometimes located within the mitochondria or in the cytoplasm, are, what protein-assembling organelles, most commonly located on the rough endoplasmic reticulum?

answer: {central limit} theorem

One form of this, due to Lindeberg and Feller, applies to the difference of variates. While it does not hold for general stochastic processes, there is a version for martingales. The rate behind this relation is determined by the Berry-Esséen theorem. It holds generally under the Lyapunov condition, but the conventional statement of it requires that the variance be finite and that the mean of the sampling distribution of means be the population mean. FTP, identify this theorem stating that the distribution of a sample of independent random variables approaches a normal distribution with sample size.

answer: {Lagrangian} function (prompt on {L})

Maxwell's equations may be derived by extremizing the time integral of the one of these corresponding to a charge in an electromagnetic field. Its form for a mechanical system is motivated by requiring the virtual displacements in d'Alembert's principle to vanish. Generalized momenta are velocity partials of this function. If it is cyclic in a coordinate, that coordinate's generalized momentum is constant due to the equation of Euler and this function's namesake. FTP, identify this function central to a non-Newtonian formulation of physics and conventionally equal to the difference of kinetic and potential energies.

answer: The {Division} of {Labor} in {Society}

This work describes the totality of all of the beliefs common to people as the “conscience collective.” One way that people feel connected to one another is through these shared beliefs, which the author terms “mechanical solidarity.” But the more important determinant of connectedness is through the title concept, which creates “organic solidarity. “ Building on Adam Smith's discussion, the author casts this functional role as a necessary precondition for civilization. The author then shows how the title concept is coextensive with similar biological collective strategies. He also describes an abnormal form of it, in which citizens suffer from anomie.

An ester modification of these is the Fries rearrangement, and it was first published in Comptes rendus in 1884. One form of them is strongly inhibited by the presence of electron acceptors and carbocation rearrangement decreases its useful yield. The reactivity of one of their constituents increases with the polarity of the C-X bond. Both forms are limited to fairly reactive arenas and use a Lewis acid catalyst, typically aluminum tri-chloride. FTP, identify these electrophilic aromatic substitutions that synthesize either an acyl or an alkyl from benzene, named for their French and American discoverers.
