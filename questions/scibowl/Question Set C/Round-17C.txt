answer: 2.5  (Accept:  2.4)
(Soln: P^co2 = (Nrt/v) = [(0.10mol)(0.0821l-Atm/k-Mol)(250k)]/1l = 2.05 Atm; P^t = 0.40 + 2.05 = 
2.45atm = 2.5 Atm)

At 250K, the pressure of oxygen in a 1-liter container is 0.40 atmospheres. If 0.10 moles of carbon dioxide are added to the container, what will be the new pressure, in atmospheres rounded to the first decimal place?
