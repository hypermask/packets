9)  Physics  Short Answer Ashley, Who Weighs 450 Newtons, Is With Her Dad at the Playground, 
and She Is Sitting on a Swing That Is 0.60 Meters Above the Ground.  Her Dad Pulls Her Back and Lets 
Her Go When the Swing Is 1.1 Meters Above the Ground.  How Fast, in Meters Per Second to the First 
Decimal Place, Is Ashley Moving When the Swing Passes Through Its Lowest Position?
Answe R:  3.1  (Accept:  3.2)
(Solution:  Pe
^G = Fd = (450n)(0.6 – 1.1m) = -225j.  Ke = -Pe
^G = ½Mv^2 ! v =  2
Mke
=
2(225j)
= 3.13 M/s)
450n / 9.8m/ S^2

Which of the following is NOT true:
W) electrons are directly affected by the strong nuclear force
X) general relativity predicts the existence of black holes
Y) a deuterium atom has two nucleons 
Z) many cosmologists believe that neutrinos make up about as much mass as all the stars in the universe

answer: W)  Tryptophan Activates Its Repressor and Lactose Leads to 
an Inactive Repressor

Which of the following is the primary difference in regulation between the lactose and tryptophan operons:
W) tryptophan activates its repressor and lactose leads to an inactive repressor
X) when tryptophan is present, the repressor is inactive and the opposite is true for allolactose in the lac operon
Y) allolactose is considered a co-repressor whereas tryptophan is actually an inducer
Z) when tryptophan is not present, the co-repressor is able to inactivate the promoter directly
