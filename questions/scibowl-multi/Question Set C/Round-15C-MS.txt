answer: Z)  the Original Plant Was Homozygous but Gary Cannot Know 
for Sure Whether It Is a Dominant or Recessive Color

BEST explanation for this breeding pattern:
W) the original plant was homozygous dominant
X) the original plant was homozygous recessive
Y) the original plant was heterozygous for both colors
Z) the original plant was homozygous but Gary cannot know for sure whether it is a dominant or recessive color
