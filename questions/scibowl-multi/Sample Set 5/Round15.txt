answer: Y) Animals With a Low Surface Area to Volume Ratio Can 
Conserve Heat More Easily

In ecology, there are two rules that identify relationships between the animal’s habitat and its shape and structure.

Which of the following represents the basis for these predictions?
W) Small animals have a higher survival rate at the equator because of t he dense foliage
X) There is less competition for food in the Arctic, so animals can grow larger
Y) Animals with a low surface area to volume ratio can conserve heat more easily
Z) The foundation for understanding both rules is based on Gloger’s rule
